executive summary marketaxess operates one of the leading platforms for the electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of fixed income securities 
through our platform  active institutional investor client firms firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january and december can access the aggregate liquidity provided by the collective interest of our broker dealer clients in buying or selling bonds through our platform 
our active institutional investor clients include investment advisers  mutual funds  insurance companies  public and private pension funds  bank portfolios and hedge funds 
we also provide data and analytical tools that help our clients make trading decisions and we facilitate the trading process by electronically communicating order information between trading counterparties 
our revenues are primarily generated from the trading of us and european high grade corporate bonds 
our multi dealer trading platform allows our institutional investor clients to simultaneously request competing  executable bids or offers from our broker dealer clients and execute trades with the broker dealer of their choice from among those that choose to respond 
we offer our broker dealer clients a solution that enables them to efficiently reach our institutional investor clients for the distribution and trading of bonds 
in addition to us high grade corporate bonds  european high grade corporate bonds and emerging markets bonds  including both high grade and non investment grade debt  we also offer our clients the ability to trade crossover and high yield bonds  agency bonds  new issues and credit default swap indices 
the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for trades executed on our platform that are billed to our broker dealer clients on a monthly basis 
we also derive revenues from information and user access fees  license fees and other income 
our expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits  depreciation and amortization  technology and communication expenses  professional and consulting fees  marketing and advertising and other general and administrative expenses 
based on our limited operating history  we will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in rapidly evolving industries  such as the electronic financial services industry 
these risks and difficulties include  but are not limited to  our ability to attract and retain broker dealer and institutional investor clients  deliver  expand and enhance reliable and cost effective product and service offerings  respond effectively to competition  diversify our sources of revenues  maintain adequate control of our expenses  and attract and retain personnel 
we operate in a highly competitive business environment 
in particular  we compete with bond trading business conducted over the telephone between broker dealers and their institutional investor clients 
institutional investors have historically purchased fixed income securities by contacting bond sales professionals at one or more broker dealers by telephone or e mail and inquiring about the price and availability of individual bonds 
this remains the manner in which the majority of corporate bonds are traded between institutional investors and broker dealers 
in addition  there are numerous other electronic trading platforms currently in existence 
these include thomson tradeweb  a multi dealer to institutional investor trading platform  and bloomberg  which provides electronic trading functionality 
we believe that we compete favorably on the basis of several factors  including the liquidity provided on our platform  the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform  the quality and speed of execution  total transaction costs  technological capabilities  including the ease of use of our trading platform  and the range of our products and services 
we also believe that we are well positioned to respond to future challenges due to the experience and continuity of our senior management team 
we seek to grow and diversify our revenues by capitalizing on our status as the operator of a leading platform for the electronic trading of corporate bonds and certain other types of fixed income securities 
the key elements of our strategy are to innovate and efficiently add new functionality and product offerings to the marketaxess platform that we believe will help us increase our market share with existing clients  as well as expand our client base  to leverage our technology  as well as our strong broker dealer and institutional investor relationships  to deploy our electronic trading platform into additional product and client segments within the fixed income securities markets  to continue building our existing service offerings so that our electronic trading platform is fully integrated into the workflow of our broker dealer and institutional investor clients and to continue to add functionality to allow our clients to achieve a fully automated end to end straight through processing solution automation from trade initiation to settlement  to add new content and analytical capabilities to corporate bondticker in order to improve the value of the information we provide to our clients  and to continue to supplement our internal growth by entering into strategic alliances  or acquiring businesses or technologies that will enable us to enter new markets  provide new products or services  or otherwise enhance the value of our platform to our clients 
history marketaxess was formed in april  and pilot trading on our fully disclosed multi dealer platform began in october we launched trading on our electronic platform in january with eight broker dealer clients 
since that time  our broker dealer clients have grown to include of the leading securities firms 
our broker dealer clients currently are abn amro  banc of america securities  barclays  bear stearns  bnp paribas  citigroup  credit suisse  deutsche bank  dresdner bank ag  dz bank ag  first tennessee national  goldman sachs  hsbc  ing financial markets  jeffries company  jpmorgan  lehman brothers  merrill lynch  morgan stanley  royal bank of canada  the royal bank of scotland  santander investment securities  soci t g n rale  ubs and wachovia 
in march  we acquired trading edge  inc trading edge  the operator of an anonymous trading platform for us corporate bonds  convertible bonds  municipal bonds and emerging markets bonds 
in  we decided to terminate the anonymous convertible and municipal bond trading platforms and currently offer us corporate bond and emerging markets bond trading on a fully disclosed basis only 
however  the technology platform developed by trading edge and obtained by us through the acquisition is now the core of our product offerings 
in august  one of our uk subsidiaries  marketaxess europe limited  began operations with secondary electronic trading in us dollar denominated and euro denominated corporate bonds 
in february  we reorganized into marketaxess holdings inc  a holding company that operates primarily through two operating subsidiaries  marketaxess corporation and marketaxess europe limited 
marketaxess corporation is registered as a broker dealer  and marketaxess europe limited is regulated as an alternative trading system  with applicable market regulators in the us and the us  respectively 
in may  we incorporated a canadian subsidiary  marketaxess canada limited  which has applied for registration under the securities act in ontario and is in the process of seeking approval for membership with the investment dealers association of canada 
we launched our information service  corporate bondticker  in july corporate bondticker combines nasd trace data with marketaxess data and analytical tools to provide trading professionals  research firms  rating and news agencies  and other market participants with a comprehensive set of corporate bond information 
we have been funded by nine of our broker dealer clients through purchases of equity securities  primarily convertible preferred stock  for a total purchase price of million 
in addition  we acquired cash and investments at fair value totaling million in connection with the acquisition of trading edge 
we also received net proceeds of million from the sale of shares of our common stock in our november initial public offering 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale totaling million 
we have no debt outstanding 
critical factors affecting our industry and our company economic  political and market factors the global fixed income securities industry is risky and volatile and is directly affected by a number of economic  political and market factors that may result in declining trading volume 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these factors include the current interest rate environment  including the volatility of interest rates and investors forecasts of future interest rates  economic and political conditions in the united states  europe and elsewhere  the availability of cash for investment by mutual funds and other institutional and retail investors  the volume of new fixed income securities being brought to the market  investors assessment of the level of risk attributable to the issuers of corporate bonds  adverse market conditions  including unforeseen market closures or other disruptions in trading  concerns over inflation and weakening consumer confidence levels  the level and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates  and legislative and regulatory changes 
any one or more of these factors may contribute to reduced trading activity in the fixed income securities markets generally 
our revenues and profitability are likely to decline during periods of stagnant economic conditions or low trading volume in the us and global fixed income securities markets 
competitive landscape the global fixed income securities industry generally  and the electronic financial services markets in which we engage in particular  are highly competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
we will continue to compete with bond trading conducted directly between broker dealers and their institutional investor clients over the telephone or electronically 
in addition  our current and prospective competitors are numerous and include other multi dealer trading companies  market data and information vendors  securities and futures exchanges  inter dealer brokerage firms  electronic communications networks  technology  software  information and media or other companies that have existing commercial relationships with broker dealers or institutional investors  and other electronic marketplaces that are not currently in the securities business 
competitors  including companies in which some of our broker dealer clients have invested  have developed electronic trading platforms or have announced their intention to explore the development of electronic platforms that compete or will compete with us 
in general  we compete on the basis of a number of key factors  including the liquidity provided on our platform  the magnitude and frequency of price improvement enabled by our platform  the quality and speed of execution  total transaction costs  technology capabilities  including the ease of use of our trading platform  and the range of our products and services 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors 
our trading volume and client acceptance have grown significantly over the past three years and we continue to proactively build technology solutions that serve the needs of the credit markets 
our competitive position is also enhanced by the familiarity and integration of our broker dealer and institutional investor clients with our electronic trading platform and other systems 
we have focused on the unique aspects of the credit markets we serve in the development of our platform  working closely with our clients to provide a system that is suited to their needs 
many of our current and potential competitors are more established and substantially larger than we are  and have a substantially greater market presence  as well as greater financial  engineering  technical  marketing and other resources 
these competitors may aggressively reduce their pricing to enter into market segments in which we have a leadership position today  potentially subsidizing any losses with profits from trading in other securities 
in addition  many of our competitors offer a wide range of services  have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases 
some of them may be able to respond more quickly to new or evolving opportunities  technologies and customer requirements than we can and may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities 
any combination of our competitors or our current broker dealer clients may enter into joint ventures or consortia to provide services similar to those provided by us 
others may acquire the capabilities necessary to compete with us through acquisitions 
significant consolidation has occurred in our industry and these firms  as well as others that may undertake such consolidation in the future  are potential competitors of ours 
regulatory environment our industry has been and is subject to continuous regulatory changes and may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations  which could require us to incur significant costs 
our us subsidiary  marketaxess corporation  is a registered broker dealer with the sec and is a member of the nasd 
our uk subsidiary  marketaxess europe limited  is registered as an alternative trading system dealer with the fsa in the uk both uk and uk regulations prohibit repayment of borrowings from these subsidiaries or their affiliates  paying cash dividends  making loans to us or our affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions that result in a significant reduction in regulatory net capital or financial resources  without prior notification to or approval from such regulated entity s principal regulator 
the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources  divert management s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members 
as a public company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act  the sarbanes oxley act of and nasdaq rules promulgated in response to the sarbanes oxley act 
the requirements of these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs  made some activities more difficult  time consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our systems and resources 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  significant resources and management oversight are required 
rapid technological changes we must continue to enhance and improve our electronic trading platform 
the electronic financial services industry is characterized by increasingly complex systems and infrastructures and new business models 
if new industry standards and practices emerge  our existing technology  systems and electronic trading platform may become obsolete or our existing business may be harmed 
our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services  develop and or license new products and technologies that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our broker dealer and institutional investor clients and prospective clients  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
trends in our business the following table identifies changes in key financial measures of our business for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands revenues change income before income taxes net income  net increase in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and securities available for sale during the year ended december   we reduced the valuation allowance by million to million based on management s current assessment of the factors impacting the valuation allowance previously recorded 
such factors include management s expectation of continuing future profitable operations and judgment concerning future utilization of certain net operating losses that are subject to section limitations prior to their expiration 
we believe it is likely  but subject to some uncertainty  that approximately of the net operating losses will be utilized prior to their expiration in in addition  we adjusted the income tax rate used for recording the deferred tax assets  resulting in a decrease in the deferred tax assets and an increase in tax expense of million 
without giving effect to the adjustment to the income tax rate used for recognizing the deferred tax assets and the reduction in the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  our net income for the year ended december  would have been million 
during the year ended december   we reduced the valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax asset by million  from million to million 
due to the fact that we had achieved multiple quarters of profitability  it became more likely than not that we would be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
we also determined that it was more likely than not that all of the temporary differences relating to the deductibility of certain expenses for book and tax purposes  including the warrant related expense  would be utilized prior to expiration 
we also recognized million in tax credits and an additional tax benefit for operating losses of million 
without giving effect to the reduction of the valuation allowance  tax credits and reversal  our net income for the year ended december  would have been million 
the majority of our revenues are derived from commissions for transactions in us and european high grade corporate bonds executed on our platform 
most transactions executed on our platform are originated by our active institutional investor clients firms that executed at least one trade through our electronic trading platform between january and december  consisting of institutions as of december  the volume of transactions executed across our platform is largely determined by the number of transaction inquiries originated by our institutional investor clients and the competitiveness of the prices they receive from our broker dealer clients in response to these inquiries 
the notional value of bonds traded over our platform has grown rapidly since the commercial launch of the platform in january to billion for the year ended december  but has remained relatively constant from to  with volume for the year ended december  totaling billion 
our overall trading volume is impacted by volume in the corporate bond market generally 
various factors that have historically impacted overall corporate bond market trading volume include the absolute level of interest rates  the direction of interest rate movements  the level of new issues of us high grade corporate bonds  volatility of corporate bond spreads versus us treasury securities  economic conditions  the geopolitical environment  market psychology  relative prices of competing asset classes and  more importantly  changes in expectations about inflation 
if interest rates continue to rise  it is possible that our trading volumes will continue to be adversely impacted 
because a significant percentage of our revenue is tied directly to the volume of securities traded on our platform  it is likely that a general decline in trading volumes  regardless of the cause of such decline  would reduce our revenues and have a significant negative impact on our future profitability 
we believe that overall us and european high grade corporate bond trading volumes declined between and based on nasd trace data  volume in the  to million range  a trade size category where nasd trace data reports the actual volume numbers  fell by between and we are dependent on our broker dealer clients  nine of which were also stockholders as of december   who are not restricted from buying and selling fixed income securities  directly or through their own proprietary or third party platforms  with institutional investors 
our broker dealer clients buy and sell fixed income securities directly with their clients through traditional bond trading methods 
any reduction in the use of our electronic trading platform by our broker dealer clients could reduce the number of different bond issues and the volume of trading in those bond issues on our platform  which could  in turn  reduce the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
commission revenue trends commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type and the maturity of the bond traded 
commission revenues grew from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  but declined to million for the year ended december  we believe that there are five key variables that impact the notional value of bonds traded on our platform and the amount of commissions earned by us the number of institutional investor clients that participate on the platform and their willingness to originate transactions through the platform  the number of broker dealer clients on the platform and the competitiveness of the prices they provide to the institutional investor clients  the number of markets for which we make trading available to our clients  the overall level of activity in these markets  and the level of commissions that we collect for trades executed through the platform 
growth in the notional value of trades executed over our platform has been driven by an increase in the base of institutional investor clients 
our active institutional investor client base clients that executed trades through our electronic trading platform in the preceding year has increased from as of december   to as of december  and to as of december  however  as the number of institutional investor clients has increased  our volumes have been and will in the future be increasingly driven not only by new clients but also by existing clients executing a larger portion of their trading activity through our platform 
we believe that our ability to continue to deliver enhanced functionality and to provide reliable  real time access to our platform will be important factors in increasing usage of the platform by existing clients 
our broker dealer client base has also increased from as of december   to as of december  and to as of december  we believe that these broker dealer clients represent the principal source of secondary market liquidity in us high grade corporate bonds  european high grade corporate bonds emerging markets bonds and the other markets in which we operate 
historical growth in the number of our broker dealer clients is not necessarily indicative of future growth  although it is likely that the majority of our future growth will be derived from additional trading by existing broker dealer clients rather than from the addition of new broker dealer clients 
we commenced commercial operations in january with the launch of our us high grade corporate bond platform 
we expanded the markets we serve to emerging markets bonds and high yield bonds in march and to european high grade corporate bonds in september in we introduced trading in agency bonds and in credit default swap indices 
in the future  we expect to leverage our existing technology and client relationships to expand into new segments of the fixed income securities market 
as the notional value of bonds traded over our platform has grown  we have also been more dependent on the overall level of activity in the markets in which we operate 
while we believe that trading activity in the fixed income markets in which we operate has generally increased since our inception  there have been periods  including the year ended december   in which such trading activity was flat or actually declined 
we have also experienced fluctuations in trading volumes between quarters as a result of general economic conditions as well as factors specific to the fixed income markets in which we operate 
these quarterly fluctuations have in the past created  and may in the future create  some variability in our revenues 
our average commission on trades executed over our platform  excluding single dealer inquiries  has declined from per million for the year ended december  to per million for the years ended december  and under the fee plans currently in place for secondary us high grade corporate bond trading and european high grade corporate bond trading  the average fees per million will decline as trading volumes increase 
we also anticipate that some reduction in average fees per million for other products may occur in the future 
consequently  past trends in commissions are not necessarily indicative of future commissions 
other revenue trends in addition to the commissions discussed above  we have also earned revenue from certain fees paid by institutional investor and broker dealer clients and income earned on investments 
institutional investor clients trading us high grade corporate bonds are charged a monthly user access fee for the use of our platform 
the fee  billed quarterly  is charged to the client based on the number of the client s users 
to encourage institutional investor clients to execute trades on our us high grade corporate bond platform  we reduce these information and user access fees for such clients once minimum quarterly trading volumes are attained 
we charge information services fees for corporate bondticker to our broker dealer clients  institutional investor clients and data only subscribers 
corporate bondticker combines nasd trace data with marketaxess data and analytical tools to provide a comprehensive set of corporate bond information 
the information services fee is a flat monthly fee  based on the level of service 
we also generate information services fees from the sale of bulk data to certain institutional investor clients and data only subscribers 
broker dealer clients  other than those that previously made equity investments in the company  pay an initial license fee  which is typically due and payable upon execution of the broker dealer agreement 
the initial license fee varies by agreement and at a minimum is intended to cover the initial set up costs incurred to enable a broker dealer to begin using the company s electronic trading platform 
revenues from these sources totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we anticipate that revenues other than commissions will grow as we expand our data and information services offerings 
expense trends our total expenses were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in the normal course of business  we incur the following expenses employee compensation and benefits expenses  which include salaries  cash based incentive compensation  stock based compensation and related employee benefits and taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  which result primarily from the depreciation of the fixed assets we purchase and development costs that we capitalize  including computer software and hardware used in the development of our trading systems  technology and communications expenses  which consist primarily of costs for our network connections with our broker dealer and institutional investor customers and our data centers  professional and consulting expenses  which consist primarily of audit  consulting  tax and legal expenses  marketing and advertising expenses  which consist primarily of media  print and other advertising expenses as well as client marketing expenses  and general and administrative expenses  which include travel and entertainment expenses  rental and occupancy expenses  board of directors expenses  charitable contributions  the provision for doubtful accounts  various state franchise and uk value added taxes and other administrative expenses and general office costs 
we anticipate expense growth in the future  notably in employee compensation and benefits as a result of increases in the number of staff as we introduce new products 
however  we believe that operating leverage can be achieved by increasing volumes in existing products and adding new products without substantial additions to our infrastructure 
in addition  beginning in the fiscal year  we are required  pursuant to sfas no 
r share based payment sfas no 
r  which became effective on january   to record compensation expense based on the fair value of stock and options issued to employees 
previously  we were only required to record compensation expense to the extent that the fair value of our common stock exceeded the exercise price of the options on the measurement date 
as a public company  we are subject to the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires us to incur significant expenditures to comply with these requirements 
revenues and expenses revenues we derive our revenues from commissions for trades executed over our platform  information and user access fees  license fees  interest income and other income 
a table detailing the amount and percentage of revenue generated from each of these sources is provided below year ended december  in thousands revenues us high grade european high grade other total commissions information and user access fees license fees interest income other total revenues the following table shows the extent to which the changes in revenue for the years ended december  and were attributable to increases and decreases in volumes  average level of commissions charged  information services  license fees  interest income and other factors change from prior year year ended december  in thousands volume increase average fee decrease information services license fees interest income other total revenue increase a table detailing the amount of revenues generated by the nine broker dealer clients that were also stockholders as of december  abn amro  banc of america securities  bear stearns  bnp paribas  credit suisse  deutsche bank  jpmorgan  lehman brothers and ubs  and their respective affiliates  as well as the corresponding percentage of total revenues  is provided below for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands revenues generated by broker dealer client stockholders and their respective affiliates commissions information and user access fees interest income other revenues generated by broker dealer client stockholders and their respective affiliates percentage of revenues generated by broker dealer client stockholders and their respective affiliates commissions information and user access fees interest income other percentage of revenues generated by broker dealer client stockholders and their respective affiliates we derive a significant percentage of our total revenues  and an even greater percentage of our commissions  from broker dealer clients that are also our stockholders 
commissions from these broker dealer stockholders have decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to increased volume from existing broker dealer clients that are not stockholders as well as the addition of new broker dealer clients that are not stockholders 
potential reduction in the level of their equity ownership if these broker dealer shareholders sell shares of our common stock in the future  may cause them to reduce or discontinue their use of our electronic trading platform and other services  which could negatively impact the use of our platform by our institutional investor clients and result in a reduction in our revenues and net income 
our current fee plans may result in a reduction in average fees as trading volume increases 
we may also introduce new plans that could result in lower fees  particularly where we believe that fee reductions will be offset by higher trading volumes 
historical trading volume and revenue are not necessarily indicative of future trading volume and revenue 
commissions while the vast majority of our commissions are generated from transactions between a broker dealer client and an institutional investor client  we have generated a de minimis amount of our commissions from transactions between two broker dealer clients 
commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of bonds traded on our platform and vary based on the type and the maturity of the bond traded 
the commission rates are generally set at levels that are based on a number of factors  including fees charged by inter dealer brokers in the respective markets  average bid offer spreads in the products we offer  transaction costs through alternative channels including the telephone  and the trading volume executed through our platform by the broker dealer completing the trade 
under our transaction fee plans  bonds that are more actively traded or that have shorter maturities are generally charged lower commissions  while bonds that are less actively traded or that have longer maturities generally command higher commissions 
overall trading volumes and the average fee per million traded for the years ended december   and are detailed in the table below year ended december  trading volume data in billions us high grade european high grade other sub total single dealer inquiries total commissions in thousands us high grade european high grade other total average fee per million traded us high grade european high grade other average fee per million traded for all products  excluding single dealer inquiries average fee per million traded for all products  including single dealer inquiries for volume reporting purposes  transactions in foreign currencies are converted to us dollars at the exchange rates prevailing on the day the transactions were executed 
single dealer inquiries represent us high grade trades for which no fees were charged in accordance with the new us high grade fee plan that went into effect on june  us high grade corporate bonds prior to august  all of our broker dealer clients operated under a standard transaction fee plan for the secondary trading of us high grade corporate bonds 
under the standard transaction fee plan  commissions were calculated as a percentage of the notional dollar volume of the bonds traded on our platform  varied based on the type and maturity of the bond  and were generally higher on bonds with longer maturities 
under this plan  there was no fixed monthly fee and no cap on the aggregate amount of commissions payable by a broker dealer client 
our standard fee schedule for us high grade corporate bonds was revised in august to provide lower average transaction commissions for dealers that transacted higher us high grade volumes through our platform  while at the same time providing us with an element of fixed commissions over the two year term of the plans 
one of the revised plans that was well suited for our most active broker dealer clients included a fee cap that limited the potential growth in us high grade revenue 
the fee caps were set to take effect at volume levels significantly above those being transacted at the time the revised transaction fee plans were introduced 
most of our broker dealer clients entered into fee arrangements with respect to the trading of us high grade corporate bonds that included both a fixed component and a variable component 
these agreements had been scheduled to expire during the third quarter of on june   we introduced a new fee plan primarily for secondary market transactions in us high grade corporate bonds executed on our electronic trading platform 
as of december   of our us high grade broker dealer clients have signed new two year agreements that supersede the fee arrangements that we entered into with many of our broker dealer clients during the third quarter of the new plan incorporates higher fixed monthly fees and lower variable fees for our broker dealer clients than the previous us high grade transaction fee plans described above  and incorporates volume incentives to our broker dealer clients that are designed to increase the volume of transactions effected on our platform 
under the new fee plan  we electronically add the variable fee to the spread quoted by the broker dealer client but do not charge for inquiries that an institutional investor client sends to a single broker dealer client 
the variable fee varies depending on the size of the trade as well as the maturity and yield of the bond traded 
the combination of higher fixed and lower variable fees in the new plan results in higher revenue to us at lower volume levels but will limit revenue growth in the future for us high grade corporate bond trading as volume levels increase 
the average commission on us high grade transactions declined for the year ended december  from to per million traded for the year ended december   but increased to per million traded for the year ended december  following the introduction of the latest fee plan in june european high grade corporate bonds on our european platform  broker dealer transaction fees vary based on the type of bond traded 
different fee schedules apply to fixed rate and floating rate bonds 
within the schedule for fixed rate bonds  the fee varies depending on whether the bond is a corporate or a sovereign issue 
for corporate bonds  the fee also varies depending on the maturity of the issue 
this fee schedule applies a tiered fee structure  which reduces the fee per trade upon the attainment of certain specified amounts of monthly commissions generated by a particular broker dealer and does not carry a fixed monthly fee or fee cap 
the average commission on european high grade transactions has decreased from per million traded for the year ended december   to per million traded for the year ended december  and to per million traded for the year ended december  this decrease in average commission per million traded was caused by a shift in the mix of bonds traded  some changes to the fee schedules and by the impact of the tiered fee structure described above 
emerging markets bonds broker dealer clients pay a commission for transactions in emerging markets bonds based on the type and amount of the security traded 
the commission is calculated on a standard schedule that applies to all broker dealer clients and varies depending on whether the transaction is in an actively traded sovereign issue  a less actively traded sovereign issue or a corporate issue 
a lower commission rate is charged for actively traded sovereign issues  while a higher commission rate is charged for corporate issues 
the average commission on emerging markets transactions for the year ended december  was per million traded and for the year ended december  was per million traded 
crossover and high yield bonds broker dealer clients pay a commission for transactions in crossover and high yield bonds that is calculated based on a standard schedule that applies to all broker dealer clients 
the fee varies depending on whether the issue is a crossover or high yield issue 
trades in crossover issues are charged in accordance with the us high grade fee schedules 
trades in high yield issues are charged at a standard fee per million 
the average commission on crossover and high yield transactions for the year ended december  was per million traded 
agency bonds broker dealer clients pay a commission for transactions in agency bonds that is calculated based on a standard schedule that applies to all broker dealer clients 
the fee varies depending on the issue size and whether the transaction is in a syndicated or non syndicated issue 
the average commission on agency transactions for the year ended december  was per million traded 
new issues for newly issued us high grade corporate bonds and for newly issued emerging markets bonds  we enable us institutional investors to submit indications of interest on our electronic trading platform directly to the underwriter syndicate desks of our broker dealer clients 
commission levels for new issue transactions are based on the allocation amount 
there are fee caps on the level of commissions paid by broker dealer clients 
the average commission on new issue transactions for the year ended december  was per million traded and for the year ended december  was per million traded 
credit default swaps commissions are charged to both broker dealer and institutional investor clients for credit default swap index transactions that are calculated as a percentage of the notional volume of transactions traded 
broker dealer clients are able to select between standard fee schedules that contain monthly minimum commissions and  in some cases  monthly fee caps 
information and user access fees information and user access fees consist of information services fees and monthly user fees 
we charge information services fees for corporate bondticker to our broker dealer clients  institutional investor clients and data only subscribers 
the information services fee is a flat monthly fee  based on the level of service 
we also generate information services fees from the sale of bulk data to certain institutional investor clients and data only subscribers 
institutional investor clients trading us high grade corporate bonds are charged a monthly user access fee for the use of our platform 
the fee  billed quarterly  is charged to the client based on the number of the client s users 
to encourage institutional investor clients to execute trades on our us high grade corporate bond platform  we reduce these information and user access fees for such clients once minimum quarterly trading volumes are attained 
license fees license fees consist of fees received from broker dealer clients 
in the agreements with our broker dealer clients  we agree to provide access to our trading platform through a non exclusive and non transferable license 
broker dealer clients  other than those that previously made equity investments in marketaxess  pay an initial license fee  which is typically due and payable upon execution of the broker dealer agreement 
the initial license fee varies by agreement and at a minimum is intended to cover the initial set up costs we incur to enable a broker dealer to begin using our platform 
the license fee is a one time fee and is recognized in the first three months of the agreement in the estimated amount of the set up costs that we incur and the remaining amount is amortized over the initial term of the agreement  which is generally three years 
we anticipate that license fees will be a less material source of revenues for us on a going forward basis 
interest income interest income consists of income earned on our investments 
we generate interest income through the investment of our excess cash in us treasury obligations  money market instruments and other high grade fixed income investments 
all investments have a maximum maturity of two years and carry a rating of a or better by standard poor s and a or better by moody s investor service 
other other revenues consist of telecommunications line charges to broker dealer clients  other miscellaneous revenues and funds received as business interruption insurance settlements  which was a non recurring item in relation to the effects of the september  terrorist acts 
expenses employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits is our most significant expense and includes employee salaries  bonuses  stock based employee compensation  related employee benefits and payroll taxes 
many employees receive bonuses based on our overall operating results as well as their individual performance 
these bonuses vary from year to year and have a significant impact on our employee compensation and benefits expense 
increases in the number of our employees and cost increases affecting employee provided benefit plans also drive changes in this expense 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of fixed assets  which consist of computer hardware  furniture and fixtures  and the amortization of software  capitalized software development costs and leasehold improvements

maintenance agreements for our computer hardware are in place to ensure that we receive technical service from the vendor in the event of a malfunction 
we enter into software maintenance agreements to ensure that we have access to the latest versions of the software we use 
the majority of our broker dealer clients have dedicated high speed communication lines to our network in order to provide fast data transfer

warrant related expense warrant related expense is the expense associated with the allocation of shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to a warrant issued to six of our broker dealer clients at the time they made an equity investment in us 
the warrant program was put in place in april and was designed to motivate broker dealers to trade on our platform 
the total number of shares underlying the warrant is  the warrant program had two distinct pieces  a us portion and a european portion  under which the aggregate number of shares underlying the warrant to be allocated in each three month period was fixed 
allocations under this program commenced on may  for the us portion and june  for the european portion and were based on each broker dealer client s respective commissions as a percentage of the total commissions paid to us from the six participating warrant holders  calculated on a quarterly basis 
shares allocated under the warrant program were expensed each quarter at fair market value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

we determined the fair market value of the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the final share allocations under the warrant program occurred on march  accordingly  we will no longer record any expense related to this warrant 
marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense consists primarily of print and other advertising expenses we incur to promote our products and services 
this expense also includes costs associated with attending or exhibiting at industry sponsored seminars  conferences and conventions 
also included in this expense are travel and entertainment expenses incurred by our sales force to promote our trading platform and information services 
moneyline revenue share moneyline revenue share expense consists of expenses incurred pursuant to our agreement with moneyline telerate moneyline  formerly an independent technology and data company  which assisted us in the development of our us high grade corporate bond and european trading platforms 
pursuant to the agreement  a revenue share was paid quarterly to moneyline based on a percentage of revenues generated on our us high grade corporate bond and european trading platforms  after deduction of identified development costs 
we have completed the transition to new internally developed software for our us high grade corporate and european bond platforms 
in the first quarter of  we ceased using the moneyline technology and have therefore incurred no revenue share expense since that date

income taxes and net operating loss carryforwards income taxes are accounted for on the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets arise as a result of our net operating losses and from the tax effect of various types of temporary differences including  in our case  differences between amounts reported for income tax purposes and for financial statement purposes 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of million 
the us net operating loss carryforwards as of december  totaling million will begin to expire in and the uk net operating loss carryforwards as of december  totaling million do not expire 
in and in  marketaxess holdings inc and marketaxess corporation  respectively  had an ownership change within the meaning of section as a result of section and pertinent tax provisions  the utilization of million and million on a tax basis and book basis  respectively  of our net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the ownership change is subject to significant limitations 
in addition  our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to additional annual limitations if there is a or greater change in our ownership  as determined over a rolling three year period 
a net operating loss carryforward enables a company to apply net operating losses incurred during a current period against a future period s profits in order to reduce tax liability in those future periods 
in periods when a company is generating operating losses  its net operating loss carryforward will increase 
the income tax effect of the net operating loss carryforwards is recorded as a deferred income tax asset 
if the company does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be able to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards  it records a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset 
additionally  as defined in section  a change in control occurs  and causes a limitation in the utilization of net operating losses  when there is a or greater change in the company s ownership  as determined over a rolling three year period 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
a valuation allowance is recognized against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized in future periods 
we generated net operating loss carryforwards from inception through the first quarter of  resulting from losses we incurred 
at each reporting period since inception  we assessed the need for a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset 
from inception through march   an allowance equal to of the deferred tax asset was established as it was unlikely that we would be able to utilize such deferred tax assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  also referred to as us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that management believes are critical 
that is  these accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance for doubtful accounts we charge certain of our institutional investor clients an information services fee and a monthly user access fee for the use of our trading platform 
the user access fees charged to an institutional investor client are reduced or eliminated if the institutional investor client meets certain minimum quarterly trading volumes 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the estimated collectibility of information and user access fees 
additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense  which is included in the general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues relating to broker dealer license fees in the first three months of the applicable agreement in the estimated amount of the set up costs incurred  and the remaining amount is amortized over the initial term of the agreement  which is generally three years

r  share based payments  as of january   which requires previously granted but unvested awards to be recorded as an expense on a prorated basis over the remaining vesting period 
had we adopted sfas no

r will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations 
warrant we allocated shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of a warrant to certain of our broker dealer clients on a quarterly basis 
allocations under our warrant program were based on a percentage of the total quarterly commissions generated either on our us or our european trading platform by broker dealer clients eligible for the warrant pool 
we accounted for this warrant in accordance with sfas no 
expense was recognized on the measurement date based on the fair market value of the shares of common stock underlying the warrant 
fair market value was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
this pricing model requires the following inputs our underlying stock price  the volatility of the underlying stock  the expiration date of the warrant  the risk free rate of return  and dividend payments on our stock 
the underlying stock price has been obtained using independent third party valuations 
for the stock volatility factor  we used a weighted average volatility over a month period for the nasdaq index 
we determined the risk free rate of return based on the interest rate of a three year us government obligation 
the expiration date of the warrant is november   and we have assumed no dividend payments on our common stock 
the final share allocations under the warrant program occurred on march  accordingly  we will no longer record any warrant related expense

the final share allocations under the warrant program occurred on march  accordingly  we no longer record any expense related to this warrant 
during the year ended december   we reduced the valuation allowance by million to million based on management s current assessment of the factors impacting the valuation allowance previously recorded 
such factors include management s expectation of continuing future profitable operations and judgment concerning future utilization of certain net operating losses that are subject to section limitations prior to their expiration 
we believe it is likely  but subject to some uncertainty  that approximately of the net operating losses will be utilized prior to their expiration in in addition  we adjusted the income tax rate used for recording the deferred tax assets resulting in a decrease in the deferred tax assets and an increase in tax expense of million

due to the fact that we had achieved multiple quarters of profitability  it became more likely than not that we would be able to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
we also determined that it was more likely than not that all of the temporary differences relating to the deductibility of certain expenses for book and tax purposes  including the warrant related expense  would be utilized prior to expiration

moneyline revenue share 
moneyline revenue share expense decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increased trading volume in us and european high grade corporate bonds that is the basis for the revenue share calculation was offset by the changes in the us high grade corporate bond fee plan in and the migration away from the moneyline platform to the new us high grade platform in may general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in this increase was due to a number of factors  including increase in occupancy expenses  value added tax vat and franchise tax payments  partially offset by the reversal of million in a vat tax reserve taken in provision for income tax for the year ended december   we recorded a net income tax benefit of million 
the benefit consists of a reduction in the valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax asset of million  the recognition of million in tax credits and an additional tax benefit for operating losses of million 
this was offset with a charge of million  which includes federal  state and local and foreign taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million against the gross deferred tax assets of million arising from net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences relating to the deductibility of certain expenses for book and tax purposes 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible 
the valuation allowance was reduced to million during the year ended december  based on our reassessment of the factors impacting the valuation allowance previously recorded 
such factors include seven consecutive quarters of profitable operations in the us and six consecutive quarters of profitable operations in the uk  our expectation of continuing future profitable operations  our anticipation that we would be able to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards during and our ability to utilize certain of the net operating loss carryforwards in future periods prior to their expiration 
we believed it was likely  but subject to some uncertainty  that approximately of the net operating losses will be utilized prior to their expiration in these net operating loss carryforwards are limited pursuant to section due to the acquisition by us of of the outstanding equity of trading edge 
this estimate assumes that all temporary differences will be utilized during this period  and that a majority of the net operating loss carryforwards subject to section limitations may expire prior to their utilization 
this valuation allowance was deemed appropriate due to available evidence indicating that some of the deferred tax assets might not be realized in future years due to annual utilization restrictions 
the net operating losses will be carried forward to future years 
we cannot predict the timing of the reversal of certain of the temporary differences 
therefore  the reversal of the temporary differences may result in charges to the provision for income taxes and may affect our future earnings 
quarterly results of operations our quarterly results have varied significantly as a result of changes in trading volume due to market conditions  a decrease in the number of trading days in certain quarters  and seasonality effects caused by slow downs in trading activity during certain periods  increases in the number of broker dealers and institutional investors using our trading platform as well as increased usage by existing clients  and expansion of the products we offer to our clients
