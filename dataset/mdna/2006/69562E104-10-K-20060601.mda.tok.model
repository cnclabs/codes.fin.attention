the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this document 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate and that apply to an investment in our common stock  please read risk factors 
our actual results may differ materially from those estimated or projected in any of these forward looking statements 
outlook we are a health care services company focused on the treatment of pain 
we have relationships with physician practices and surgery centers 
our growth strategy is to enter into management agreements with profitable  established physician practices and expand the range of services they offer 
because we have acquired either the non medical assets or the entire practice of practices since december   and because our growth strategy involves acquiring additional physician practices  our historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expressed from any future period 
our company was formed in february and was acquired by helpmate robotics  inc in a merger in june before the merger  paincare operated two pain management practices and helpmate had sold its previous business 
you should read the notes to our consolidated financial statements if you would like more information on our history 
we provide our services through physician practices with which we have one of three types of relationships owned practices 
these practices are owned by us through one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we own the medical assets and the physicians are our employees 
managed practices 
in states where the corporate practice of medicine is not permitted  we are not permitted to own a physician s practice 
in these states  we manage physician practice s pursuant to a management agreement 
service and equipment contracts 
we provide limited management services and equipment pursuant to specific contractual agreements in such areas as in house physical therapy  electrodiagnostic services and in office surgery 

table of contents we currently have two owned practices primarily providing surgery services  five owned practices primarily providing pain management services  one managed practice primarily providing surgery services  eleven managed practices primarily providing pain management services  two managed practices providing ancillary services  and limited management services and equipment contracts 
we had a number of acquisitions since we began our current business in the following table presents the changes in the number of practices we own and manage at december     and at december  owned physician practices managed physician practices limited management service and equipment contracts we manage fourteen practices in states with laws governing the corporate practice of medicine 
in those states  a corporation is precluded from owning the medical assets and practicing medicine 
therefore  contractual arrangements are effected to allow us to manage the practice 
emerging issues task force eitf no 
states that financial consolidation can occur when a physician practice management entity establishes an other than temporary controlling financial interest in a physician practice through contractual arrangements 
in all cases but one  the management services agreement between paincare and our managed practices satisfies each of the eitf issues 
except for one of our managed practices  we recognize all of the revenue and expenses of these practices in our consolidated financials in accordance with eitf no 
with respect to the one managed practice for which we do not recognize all of the revenue and expenses and in all of our limited managed practices  we recognize only the management fees earned and expenses incurred by us with respect to such practices 
the company s previously issued consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december  through and all quarterly financial information for each of these years have been restated to give effect to the correction of certain errors that were discovered subsequent to december  financial overview revenue and operating income we present three categories of revenue in our statement of operations pain management  surgeries and ancillary services 
pain management revenue is derived from our owned and managed practices  which provide pain management services 
surgery revenue is derived from our owned and managed practices  which primarily provide surgical services 
ancillary service revenue is derived from our owned and managed practices and limited management practices  which provide one or more of our ancillary services  including orthopedic rehabilitation  electrodiagnostic medicine  intra articular joint therapy and diagnostic imagery 
our cost of revenue is primarily physicians salaries and medical supplies

significant accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the 
table of contents reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  contractual obligations  restructuring costs  retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting estimates include revenue recognition 
our consolidated practice revenue is recognized at the time the service is performed at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered 
revenue from limited management fees is recognized as the services are performed under the terms of the contract 
we are a provider under the medicare program and various other third party payor arrangements which provide for payments to us at amounts different from its established rates 
provisions for estimated third party payor settlements  if necessary  are provided in the period the related services are rendered 
intangible assets 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 if conditions exist that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  we review those intangible assets with definite lives to ensure they are appropriately valued 
goodwill is not amortized

we are obligated to make  in principal payments under this indebtedness in and  in we may not have adequate funds from operations to repay the debt when it comes due 
it will be necessary  in order to expand the business  consummate acquisitions and refinance indebtedness  to incur additional debt and or raise additional capital 
no assurance can be given at this time that such funds will be available  or  if available  will be sufficient in the near term or that future funds will be sufficient to meet growth 
in the event of such developments  attaining financing under such conditions may not be possible  or even if such funds are available  the terms on such capital may not be commercially feasible or advantageous

the warrants have a term of four years ending on december  and are exercisable at an adjusted fixed exercise price of per share 
the debentures and the warrants have full ratchet anti dilution protection  which means that  with certain exceptions  if we issue common stock or securities convertible or exercisable for common stock  with a purchase  conversion or exercise price below the conversion price of the debentures and the exercise price of the warrants  such conversion and exercise prices are automatically reduced to the lower price 
the debenture holders also have a right of first refusal to participate in future equity financings of paincare 
with certain exceptions  paincare is not permitted to incur debt that would be senior to or pari passu with the debentures 
the securities purchase agreement pursuant to which the debentures were sold provides that we shall not effect any conversion of debentures or issue any shares upon exercise of the warrants  and holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of debentures or exercise the warrants  to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion or exercise  the holder together with the holder s affiliates  would beneficially own in excess of of the number of shares of the common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion

other debt on may   the company closed on a million  senior secured credit facility from an investment fund managed by hbk investments lp the credit facility  which carries a term of months and an interest rate equal to libor or prime  will be used primarily to fund the company s growth through acquisition strategy and to retire a portion of the company s existing debt

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we do not currently have any trading derivatives nor do we expect to have any in the future 
we have established policies and internal processes related to the management of market risks  which we use in the normal course of our business operations 

table of contents interest rate risk we have interest rate risk  in that borrowings under our credit facility are based on variable market interest rates 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit facility 
presently  the revolving credit line bears interest at a rate of either libor plus or prime plus  with a term of months 
a hypothetical increase in our credit facility s weighted average interest rate of per annum for the twelve months ended december  would correspondingly decrease our pre tax earnings and operating cash flows by approximately  and  respectively 
intangible asset risk we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows 
as a result of our periodic evaluations  we may determine that the intangible asset values need to be written down to their fair values  which could result in material charges that could be adverse to our operating results and financial position 
although at december  we believed our intangible assets were recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
we continue to monitor those assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets 
equity price risk we do not own any equity investments  other than in our subsidiaries 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct equity price risk 
commodity price risk we do not enter into contracts for the purchase or sale of commodities 
as a result  we do not currently have any direct commodity price risk
