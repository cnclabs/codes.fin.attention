kcp l kcp l  headquartered in kansas city  missouri  engages in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity 
kcp l serves approximately  customers located in all or portions of counties in western missouri and eastern kansas 
customers include approximately  residences  over  commercial firms  and over  industrials  municipalities and other electric utilities 
kcp l s retail revenues averaged approximately of its total operating revenues over the last three years 
wholesale firm power  bulk power sales and miscellaneous electric revenues accounted for the remainder of utility revenues 
kcp l is significantly impacted by seasonality with approximately one third of its retail revenues recorded in the third quarter 
kcp l s total electric revenues averaged approximately of great plains energy s revenues over the last three years 
kcp l s income from continuing operations accounted for approximately  and of great plains energy s income from continuing operations in  and  respectively 
regulation kcp l is regulated by the public service commission of the state of missouri mpsc and the state corporation commission of the state of kansas kcc with respect to retail rates  certain accounting matters  standards of service and  in certain cases  the issuance of securities  certification of facilities and service territories 
kcp l is classified as a public utility under the federal power act and accordingly  is subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
by virtue of its ownership interest in wolf creek generating station wolf creek  kcp l is subject to regulation by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  with respect to licensing  operations and safety related requirements

see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
competition missouri and kansas continue on the fully integrated utility model and no legislation authorizing retail choice has been introduced in missouri or kansas for several years 
as a result  kcp l does not compete with others to supply and deliver electricity in its franchised service territory  although other sources of energy can provide alternatives to kcp l s customers 
if missouri or kansas were to pass and implement legislation authorizing or mandating retail choice  kcp l may no longer be able to apply regulated utility accounting principles to deregulated portions of its operations and may be required to write off certain regulatory assets and liabilities 
kcp l does compete in the wholesale market to sell power in circumstances when power generated is not required for customers in its service territory 
kcp l competes in this regard with other owners of generating stations  principally utilities in its region  on the basis of availability and price 
in recent years these wholesale sales have been an important source of revenues to kcp l 
power supply kcp l is a member of the southwest power pool  inc spp reliability region 
as one of the ten regional members of the north american electric reliability council  spp is responsible for maintaining reliability in its area through coordination of planning and operations 
as a member of the spp  kcp l is required to maintain a capacity margin of at least of its projected peak summer demand 
this net positive supply of capacity and energy is maintained through its generation assets and capacity  power purchase agreements and peak demand reduction programs 
the capacity margin is designed to ensure the reliability of electric energy in the spp region in the event of operational failure of power generating units utilized by the members of the spp 
kcp l s maximum system net hourly summer peak load of  mw occurred on august  the maximum winter peak load of  mw occurred on december  during  the summer peak load was  mw 
the projected peak summer demand for is  mw 
kcp l expects to meet its projected capacity requirements for the years through with its generation assets and through short term capacity purchases  additional demand side management and efficiency programs and the addition of wind generation 
as part of its comprehensive energy plan  kcp l expects to have iatan no 
in service in fuel the principal sources of fuel for kcp l s electric generation are coal and nuclear fuel 
kcp l expects  with normal weather  to satisfy approximately of its fuel requirements from these sources with the remainder provided by natural gas and oil 
the actual and estimated fuel mix and delivered cost in cents per net kwh generated are in the following table 
fuel cost in cents per fuel mix a net kwh generated estimated actual estimated actual fuel coal nuclear natural gas and oil total generation a fuel mix based on percent of total mwhs generated 
less than of kcp l s rates contain an automatic fuel adjustment clause 
consequently  to the extent the price of coal  coal transportation  nuclear fuel  nuclear fuel processing  natural gas or purchased power increase significantly after the expiration of the contracts described in this section  or if kcp l s lower fuel cost units do not meet anticipated availability levels  kcp l s net income may be adversely affected until the increased cost could be reflected in rates 
coal during  kcp l s generating units  including jointly owned units  are projected to burn approximately million tons of coal 
kcp l has entered into coal purchase contracts with various suppliers in wyoming s powder river basin prb  the nation s principal supply region of low sulfur coal  and with local suppliers 
these contracts will satisfy all projected coal requirements for and and  and respectively  for through the remainder of kcp l s coal requirements will be fulfilled through additional contracts or spot market purchases 
kcp l has entered into its coal contracts over time at higher average prices affecting coal costs for and beyond 
kcp l has also entered into rail transportation contracts with various railroads for moving coal from the prb to its generating units 
these contracts will satisfy approximately all of the projected requirements for and and  and  respectively  for through  however  kcp l has been experiencing coal delivery issues 
coal transportation costs are expected to increase in and beyond 
see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding a rate complaint case against union pacific railroad company 
see item md a  kcp l business overview for additional information 
nuclear fuel kcp l owns of wolf creek nuclear operating corporation wcnoc  the operating company for wolf creek  its only nuclear generating unit 
wolf creek purchases uranium and has it processed for use as fuel in its reactor 
this is a three step process that involves conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride  enrichment of uranium hexafluoride and fabrication of nuclear fuel assemblies 
the owners of wolf creek have on hand or under contract of the uranium and conversion services needed to operate wolf creek through september the owners also have under contract of the uranium enrichment required to operate wolf creek through march fabrication requirements are under contract through letters of intent have been issued with suppliers for a substantial portion of wolf creek s uranium  conversion and enrichment requirements extending through at least all uranium  uranium conversion and uranium enrichment arrangements  as well as the fabrication agreement  have been entered into in the ordinary course of business 
however  contraction and consolidation among suppliers of these commodities and services  coupled with increasing worldwide demand and past inventory drawdowns  have introduced some uncertainty as to wolf creek s ability to replace some of these contracts in the event of a protracted supply disruption 
great plains energy s management believes this potential problem is common to the nuclear industry 
accordingly  in the event the affected contracts were required to be replaced  great plains energy s and wolf creek s management believes that the industry and government would work together to minimize disruption of the nuclear industry s operations  including wolf creek s operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding nuclear plant 
natural gas kcp l is projecting decreased use of natural gas during as a result of kcp l s projected normal summer weather and fewer plant outages in kcp l has hedged approximately of its projected natural gas usage for generation requirements to serve retail load and firm mwh sales 
purchased power at times  kcp l purchases power to meet its customers needs 
management believes kcp l will be able to obtain enough power to meet its future demands due to the coordination of planning and operations in the spp region  however  price and availability of power purchases may be impacted during periods of high demand 
kcp l s purchased power  as a percent of mwh requirements  averaged approximately for  and environmental matters kcp l s operations are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities with regard to air and other environmental matters 
the generation and transmission of electricity produces and requires disposal of certain hazardous products that are subject to these laws and regulations 
in addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations  these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance  including fines  injunctive relief and other sanctions 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on kcp l 
kcp l operates in an environmentally responsible manner and seeks to use current technology to avoid and treat contamination 
kcp l regularly conducts environmental audits designed to ensure compliance with governmental regulations and to detect contamination 
environmental related legislation is continuously introduced in congress 
such legislation typically includes various compliance dates and compliance limits 
such legislation could have the potential for a significant financial impact on kcp l  including the installation of new pollution control equipment to achieve compliance 
however  kcp l would seek recovery of capital costs and expenses for such compliance through rates 
kcp l will continue to monitor proposed legislation

strategic energy great plains energy owns just under of the indirect interest in strategic energy 
strategic energy provides competitive retail electricity supply services by entering into power supply contracts to supply electricity to its end use customers 
of the states that offer retail choice  strategic energy operates in california  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  new jersey  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and texas 
in addition to competitive retail electricity supply services  strategic energy records insignificant wholesale revenues and purchased power expense incidental to the retail services provided 
strategic energy also provides strategic planning  consulting and billing and scheduling services in the natural gas and electricity markets 
strategic energy provides services to approximately  commercial  institutional and small manufacturing accounts for approximately  customers including numerous fortune companies  smaller companies and governmental entities 
strategic energy s projected mwh deliveries for based on signed contracts and expected additional mwh contracts and deliveries are in the range of to million mwhs 
based solely on expected usage under current signed contracts  strategic energy has forecasted future mwh commitments backlog of million  million and million for the years through  respectively 
strategic energy s revenues averaged approximately of great plains energy s revenues over the last three years 
strategic energy s net income accounted for approximately  and of great plains energy s income from continuing operations in  and  respectively 
strategic energy s growth objective is to continue to expand in retail choice states and continue to earn its share of a large and growing market opportunity 
strategic energy s continued success is dependent on a number of industry and operational factors including  but not limited to  the ability to contract for wholesale mwhs to meet its customers needs at prices that are competitive with the host utility territory rates and with current and or future competitors  the ability to provide value added customer services and the ability to attract and retain employees experienced in providing service in retail choice states 
power supply strategic energy does not own any generation  transmission or distribution facilities 
strategic energy purchases blocks of electricity from power suppliers based on forecasted peak demand for its retail customers 
management believes it will have adequate access to energy in the markets it serves 
regulation strategic energy  as a participant in the wholesale electricity and transmission markets  is subject to ferc jurisdiction 
additionally  strategic energy is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies in states where strategic energy is licensed to sell power 
each state has a public utility commission and rules related to retail choice 
each state s rules are distinct and may conflict 
these rules do not restrict the amount strategic energy can charge for its services  but can have an impact on strategic energy s ability to provide retail electricity services in any jurisdiction 
texas during  the public utility commission of texas texas puc opened a project to review rules related to the price to beat ptb and provider of last resort 
should the texas puc change the current ptb mechanism to one that is less reflective of market based rates  the change could have an impact on this competitive market and strategic energy s prospects for growth in texas 
seams elimination charge adjustment seams elimination charge adjustment seca is a transitional pricing mechanism authorized by ferc and intended to compensate transmission owners for the revenue lost as a result of ferc s elimination of regional through and out rates between pjm interconnection pjm and the midwest independent transmission system operator  inc miso during a month transition period from december   through march  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding seca 
transmission in many markets  rtos isos manage the power flows  maintain reliability and administer transmission access for the electric transmission grid in a defined region 
rtos isos coordinate and monitor communications among the generator  distributor and retail electricity provider 
additionally  rtos isos manage the real time electricity supply and demand  and direct the energy flow 
through these activities rtos isos maintain a reliable energy supply within their region 
as a competitive retail electricity supplier  strategic energy must register with each rto iso in order to operate in the markets covered by their grids 
strategic energy primarily engages with pjm  new england rto formerly iso new england  california iso  new york iso  electric reliability council of texas ercot and miso 
in some cases  rto isos provide strategic energy with all or a combination of the data for billing  settlement  application of electricity rates and information regarding the imbalance of electricity supply 
in addition  they provide balancing energy services and ancillary services to strategic energy in the fulfillment of providing services to retail end users 
strategic energy must go through a settlement process with each rto iso in which the rto iso compares scheduled power with actual meter usage during a given time period and adjusts the original costs charged to strategic energy through a revised settlement 
all participants in the rtos isos have exposure to other market participants 
in the event of default by a market participant within the rtos isos  the uncollectible balance is generally allocated to the remaining participants in proportion to their load share 
rtos isos may continue to modify the market structure and mechanisms in an attempt to improve market efficiency 
in addition  existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to strategic energy s activities 
these actions could have an effect on strategic energy s results of operations 
strategic energy participates extensively  together with other market participants  in relevant rto iso governance and regulatory issues 
competition strategic energy operates in several retail choice electricity markets 
strategic energy has several competitors that operate in most or all of the same states in which it provides services to customers 
some of these competitors also operate in states other than where strategic energy has operations 
strategic energy also faces competition in certain markets from regional suppliers and deregulated utility affiliates formed by holding companies affiliated with regulated utilities to provide retail load in their home market territories 
strategic energy s competitors vary in size from small companies to large corporations  some of which have significantly greater financial  marketing  and procurement resources than strategic energy 
additionally  strategic energy  as well as its other competitors  must compete with the host utility in order to convince customers to switch from the host utility 
in most markets  there is a regulatory lag that slows the adjustment of host public utility rates in response to changes in wholesale prices  which may negatively affect strategic energy s ability to compete in a rising wholesale price environment 
the principal elements of competition are price  service and product differentiation

item a 
risk factors actual results in future periods for great plains energy and consolidated kcp l could differ materially from historical results and the forward looking statements contained in this report 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
the companies business is influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict  involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results  and are often beyond the companies control 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that the companies management currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the companies 
the risk factors described below  as well as the other information included in this annual report and in the other documents filed with the sec  should be carefully considered before making an investment in the company s securities 
risk factors of consolidated kcp l are also risk factors for great plains energy 
the company has regulatory risks the company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation  as described below 
failure to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals  in a timely manner  adoption of new regulations by federal or state agencies  or changes to current regulations and interpretations of such regulations may materially affect the company s business and its results of operations and financial position 
the energy policy act of repealed the public utility holding company act of  as amended  and provided certain utility customer protection authority to ferc and the states 
the energy policy act of  among other things  also requires ferc to perform a study of competition in wholesale and retail electricity markets and authorizes the creation of an electric reliability organization ero to establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards subject to ferc oversight 
the final rule for ero development and processes for insuring reliable grid operations was issued in february management has not yet determined the impact of this final rule 
ferc is in the process of establishing rules implementing the energy policy act of  and there is the risk that the rules may adversely affect operations  the results of operations and financial condition of the company 
kcp l is regulated by the mpsc and kcc with respect to retail rates  certain accounting matters  standards of service and  in certain cases  the issuance of securities and certification of facilities and service territories 
failure to obtain adequate and timely rate relief may adversely affect kcp l s results of operations and financial condition 
kcp l is also subject to regulation by ferc with respect to the issuance of short term debt  wholesale electricity sales and transmission matters and the nrc as to nuclear operations 
strategic energy is a participant in the wholesale electricity and transmission markets  and is subject to ferc regulation with respect to wholesale electricity sales and transmission matters 
additionally  strategic energy is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies in states where it has retail customers 
each state has a public utility commission and rules related to retail choice 
each state s rules are distinct and may conflict 
these rules do not restrict the amount strategic energy can charge for its services  but can have an impact on strategic energy s ability to provide retail electricity services in each state 
additionally  each state regulates the rates of the host public utility  and the timing and amount of changes in host public utility rates can materially affect strategic energy s results of operations and financial position 
the company has financial market and ratings risks the company relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations 
kcp l s capital requirements are expected to increase substantially over the next several years as it implements the generation and environmental projects in its comprehensive energy plan 
the company s management believes that it will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets at a reasonable cost based upon current credit ratings and market conditions 
however  changes in market conditions or credit ratings could adversely affect its ability to access financial markets at a reasonable cost  impact the rate treatment provided kcp l  or both  and therefore materially affect its results of operations and financial position 
great plains energy  kcp l and certain of their securities are rated by moody s investors service and standard poor s 
these ratings impact the company s cost of funds and great plains energy s ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries 
the company s financial statements reflect the application of critical accounting policies the application of the company s critical accounting policies reflects complex judgments and estimates 
these policies include industry specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities  accounting for pensions  long lived and intangible assets  goodwill and derivative instruments 
the adoption of new generally accepted accounting principles gaap or changes to current accounting policies or interpretations of such policies may materially affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
the company is subject to environmental laws and the incurrence of environmental liabilities the company is subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities with regard to air and other environmental matters primarily through kcp l s operations 
the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity produces and requires disposal of certain hazardous products  which are subject to these laws and regulations 
in addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations  these laws and regulations authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance  including fines  injunctive relief and other sanctions 
kcp l regularly conducts environmental audits designed to ensure compliance with governmental regulations and to detect contamination 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on great plains energy and consolidated kcp l results of operations and financial position 
new environmental laws and regulations affecting kcp l s operations may be adopted  and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to kcp l or its facilities  which may substantially increase its environmental expenditures in the future 
new facilities  or modifications of existing facilities  may require new environmental permits or amendments to existing permits 
delays in the environmental permitting process  denials of permit applications or conditions imposed in permits may materially affect the cost and timing of the generation and environmental retrofit projects included in the comprehensive energy plan  among other projects  and thus materially affect kcp l s results of operations and financial position 
in addition  kcp l may not be able to recover all of its costs for environmental expenditures through rates in the future 
under current law  kcp l is also generally responsible for any on site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of its facilities that it has previously owned or operated  regardless of whether the liabilities arose before  during or after the time it owned or operated the facilities 
the incurrence of material environmental costs or liabilities  without related rate recovery  could have a material adverse effect on kcp l s results of operations and financial position 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding environmental matters 
great plains energy s ability to pay dividends and meet financial obligations depends on its subsidiaries great plains energy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own 
the primary source of funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders and its financial obligations is dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries  particularly kcp l 
the ability of great plains energy s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions  and  accordingly  great plains energy s ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its financial obligations  will depend on the actual and projected earnings and cash flow  capital requirements and general financial position of its subsidiaries  as well as on regulatory factors  financial covenants  general business conditions and other matters 
kcp l and strategic energy are affected by demand  seasonality and weather the results of operations of kcp l and strategic energy can be materially affected by changes in weather and customer demand 
kcp l and strategic energy estimate customer demand based on historical trends  to procure fuel and purchased power 
differences in customer usage from these estimates due to weather or other factors could materially affect kcp l s and strategic energy s results of operations 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities 
kcp l is significantly impacted by seasonality with approximately one third of its retail revenues recorded in the third quarter 
strategic energy is impacted by seasonality  but to a much lesser extent 
in addition  severe weather  including but not limited to tornados  snow  rain and ice storms can be destructive causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses and lower revenues 
kcp l s iatan and hawthorn stations use water from the missouri river for cooling purposes 
low water and flow levels  which have been experienced in recent years  can increase kcp l s maintenance costs at these stations and  if these levels get low enough  could cause kcp l to modify plant operations 
kcp l and strategic energy have commodity price risks kcp l and strategic energy engage in the wholesale and retail marketing of electricity and  accordingly  are exposed to risks associated with the price of electricity 
strategic energy routinely enters into contracts to purchase and sell electricity in the normal course of business 
kcp l generates  purchases and sells electricity in the retail and wholesale markets 
fossil fuel and transportation prices impact kcp l s costs less than of kcp l s rates contain an automatic fuel adjustment clause  exposing kcp l to risk from changes in the market prices of coal and natural gas used to generate power and in the cost of coal and natural gas transportation 
changes in kcp l s fuel mix due to electricity demand  plant availability  transportation issues  fuel prices and other factors can also adversely affect kcp l s fuel costs 
kcp l does not hedge its entire exposure from fossil fuel and transportation price volatility 
as a consequence  its results of operations and financial position may be materially impacted by changes in these prices  until increased costs are recovered in rates 
wholesale electricity prices affect costs and revenues kcp l s ability to maintain or increase its level of wholesale sales depends on the wholesale market price  transmission availability and the availability of kcp l s generation for wholesale sales  among other factors 
a substantial portion of kcp l s wholesale sales are made in the spot market  and thus kcp l has immediate exposure to wholesale price changes 
declines in wholesale market price or availability of generation or transmission constraints in the wholesale markets  could reduce kcp l s wholesale sales and adversely affect kcp l s results of operations and financial position 
kcp l is also exposed to risk because at times it purchases power to meet its customers needs 
the cost of these purchases may be affected by the timing of customer demand and or unavailability of kcp l s lower priced generating units 
wholesale power prices can be volatile and generally increase in times of high regional demand and high natural gas prices 
strategic energy operates in competitive retail electricity markets  competing against the host utilities and other retail suppliers 
wholesale electricity costs  which account for a significant portion of its operating expenses  can materially affect strategic energy s ability to attract and retain retail electricity customers at profitable prices 
there is also a regulatory lag that slows the adjustment of host public utility rates in response to changes in wholesale prices 
this lag can negatively affect strategic energy s ability to compete in a rising wholesale price environment 
strategic energy manages wholesale electricity risk by establishing risk limits and entering into contracts to offset some of its positions to balance energy supply and demand  however  strategic energy does not hedge its entire exposure to electricity price volatility 
as a consequence  its results of operations and financial position may be materially impacted by changes in the wholesale price of electricity 
kcp l has operations risks the operation of kcp l s electric generation  transmission and distribution systems involves many risks  including breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  operating limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions  environmental or other regulatory requirements  fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions  transmission scheduling  and catastrophic events such as fires  explosions  severe weather or other similar occurrences 
these and other operating events may reduce kcp l s revenues or increase its costs  or both  and may materially affect kcp l s results of operations and financial position 
kcp l has construction related risks kcp l s comprehensive energy plan includes the construction of an estimated mw coal fired generating plant  mw of wind generation and environmental retrofits at two existing coal fired units 
kcp l has not recently managed a construction program of this magnitude 
there are risks that actual costs may exceed budget estimates  delays may occur in obtaining permits and materials  suppliers and contractors may not perform as required under their contracts  and events beyond kcp l s control may occur that may materially affect the schedule  budget and performance of these projects 
these risks may increase the costs of these construction projects  require kcp l to purchase additional electricity to supply its retail customers until the projects are completed  or both  and may materially affect kcp l s results of operations and financial position 
kcp l has retirement related risks through  approximately of kcp l s current employees will be eligible to retire with full pension benefits 
failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees  including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees  may adversely affect kcp l s ability to manage and operate its business 
substantially all of kcp l s employees participate in defined benefit and postretirement plans 
if kcp l employees retire when they become eligible for retirement through  or if kcp l s plans experience adverse market returns on its investments  or if interest rates materially fall  kcp l s pension expense and contributions to the plans could rise substantially over historical levels 
the timing and number of employees retiring and selecting the lump sum payment option could result in pension settlement charges that could materially affect kcp l s results of operations 
in addition  assumptions related to future costs  returns on investments  interest rates and other actuarial assumptions  including projected retirements  have a significant impact on kcp l s results of operations and financial position 
proposed legislation pending in congress on pension reform could result in increased pension funding requirements 
the financial accounting standards board fasb has a project to reconsider the accounting for pensions and other post retirement benefits 
this project may result in accelerated expense  liability recognition and contributions 
kcp l has nuclear exposure kcp l owns mw of wolf creek 
the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities  including wolf creek 
in the event of non compliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines  shut down the facilities  or both  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
any revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could result in substantial capital expenditures at wolf creek 
wolf creek has the lowest fuel cost per mwh of any of kcp l s generating units 
although not expected  an extended outage of wolf creek  whether resulting from nrc action  an incident at the plant or otherwise  could have a substantial adverse effect on kcp l s results of operations and financial position in the event kcp l incurs higher replacement power and other costs that are not recovered through rates 
if a long term outage occurred  the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the wolf creek investment from rate base 
ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit exposes kcp l to risks regarding decommissioning costs at the end of the unit s life 
kcp l contributes annually to a tax qualified trust fund to be used to decommission wolf creek 
the funding level assumes a projected level of return on trust assets 
if the actual return on trust assets is below the anticipated level  kcp l could be responsible for the balance of funds required 
if returns are lower than the expected level  management believes a rate increase would be allowed ensuring full recovery of decommissioning costs over the remaining life of the unit 
kcp l is also exposed to other risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit  including but not limited to potential liability associated with the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of a nuclear generating unit and the storage  handling and disposal of radioactive materials  and to potential retrospective assessments and losses in excess of insurance coverage 
strategic energy operates in competitive retail electricity markets strategic energy has several competitors that operate in most or all of the same states in which it serves customers 
some of these competitors also operate in states other than where strategic energy has operations 
it also faces competition in certain markets from regional suppliers and deregulated utility affiliates formed by holding companies affiliated with regulated utilities to provide retail load in their home market territories 
strategic energy s competitors vary in size from small companies to large corporations  some of which have significantly greater financial  marketing and procurement resources than strategic energy 
additionally  strategic energy  as well as its other competitors  must compete with the host utility in order to convince customers to switch from the host utility 
strategic energy s results of operations and financial position are impacted by the success strategic energy has in attracting and retaining customers in these markets 
strategic energy has wholesale electricity supplier credit risk strategic energy has credit risk exposure in the form of the loss that it could incur if a counterparty failed to perform under its contractual obligations 
strategic energy enters into forward contracts with multiple suppliers 
in the event of supplier non delivery or default  strategic energy s results of operations could be affected to the extent the cost of replacement power exceeded the combination of the contracted price with the supplier and the amount of collateral held by strategic energy to mitigate its credit risk with the supplier 
strategic energy s results of operations could also be affected  in a given period  if it were required to make a payment upon termination of a supplier contract to the extent the contracted price with the supplier exceeded the market value of the contract at the time of termination

louis county  missouri circuit court 
klt telecom acquired a controlling interest in dti holdings  inc holdings in february through the purchase of approximately two thirds of the holdings stock held by weinstein 
in connection with that purchase  klt telecom entered into a put option in favor of weinstein  which granted weinstein an option to sell to klt telecom his remaining shares of holdings stock 
the put option provided for an aggregate exercise price for the remaining shares equal to their fair market value with an aggregate floor amount of million and was exercisable between september   and august  in june  the stock of holdings was cancelled and extinguished pursuant to the joint chapter plan confirmed by the bankruptcy court 
in september  weinstein delivered a notice of exercise of his claimed rights under the put option 
klt telecom rejected the notice of exercise 
klt telecom denied that weinstein has any remaining rights or claims pursuant to the put option and denied any obligation to pay weinstein any amount under the put option 
subsequent to klt telecom s rejection of his notice of exercise  weinstein filed suit alleging breach of contract 
weinstein sought damages of at least million  plus statutory interest

strategic energy s business plan strategic energy is addressing the rising electricity price environment by focusing on four key areas 
positioning strategic energy is focused on retail choice markets where host utility electricity prices adjust quickly to changes in the wholesale markets and a consultative sales approach to provide value to customers 
procurement strategic energy is focused on strategies to gain price improvement through load aggregation to increase the volume purchased from certain suppliers 
strategic energy has continued to invest in talent to improve procurement practices as well as identify and take advantage of opportunities to manage retail portfolio load requirements 
products strategic energy is focused on designing and marketing products to address customers needs in a high price environment 
in  over half of strategic energy s new sales were attributable to the introduction of new products or product extensions into new customer classes 
in  management expects to introduce additional new and innovative products and services in each of strategic energy s customer classes 
the introduction of these products and services will strive to meet customers expectations in challenging and dynamic retail choice markets 
productivity new systems are in the process of being implemented and are anticipated to improve operational scalability 
focusing on dynamic markets also enhances productivity by enabling strategic energy to maximize general and administrative resources 
kcp l business overview kcp l is an integrated  regulated electric utility that engages in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity 
kcp l has over  mws of generating capacity and has transmission and distribution facilities that provide electricity to approximately  customers in the states of missouri and kansas 
kcp l has continued to experience modest load growth 
load growth consists of higher usage per customer and the addition of new customers 
retail electricity rates are below the national average 
kcp l s residential customers usage patterns are significantly affected by weather 
bulk power sales  the major component of wholesale sales  vary with system requirements  generating unit and purchased power availability  fuel costs and requirements of other electric systems 
less than of revenues include an automatic fuel adjustment provision 
kcp l s coal base load equivalent availability factor decreased to in from in  reflecting scheduled and forced plant outages 
the mw montrose no 
generator step up transformer gsu failed in late may kcp l leased a spare gsu until the failed gsu was repaired and installed during the fourth quarter of in august  hawthorn no 
s gsu failed  which resulted in a day outage 
a spare gsu was installed in september  however  the size of the spare gsu limits the output of the unit to net mw 
the mw decrease in hawthorn no 
capability will continue until a new transformer is installed  currently expected in june the outage to install the repaired gsu is expected to be completed in days 
kcp l s nuclear unit  wolf creek  accounts for approximately of its base load capacity and over a three year period averaged over of kcp l s mwhs generated 
wolf creek s availability was approximately lower in compared to due to its scheduled spring refueling outage 
replacement power costs for scheduled wolf creek outages are accrued evenly over the unit s month operating cycle 
kcp l expects its cost of nuclear fuel to remain relatively stable through because of contracts in place 
the fuel cost per mwh generated and the purchased power cost per mwh has a significant impact on the results of operations for kcp l 
generation fuel mix can substantially change the fuel cost per mwh generated 
nuclear fuel cost per mwh generated is substantially less than the cost of coal per mwh generated  which is significantly lower than the cost of natural gas and oil per mwh generated 
the cost per mwh for purchased power is significantly higher than the cost per mwh of coal and nuclear generation 
kcp l continually evaluates its system requirements  the availability of generating units  availability and cost of fuel supply and purchased power  and the requirements of other electric systems to provide reliable power economically 
kcp l expects its fuel expense to increase significantly in due to projected increases in the cost of coal and coal transportation 
the anticipated increase in delivered coal prices is expected to affect most regional utilities  therefore  the increase is not expected to materially erode kcp l s position as a low cost regional electricity generator 
rail companies have experienced longer cycle times for coal deliveries to utilities across the country since the third quarter of western rail service further deteriorated in due to two train derailments that occurred on the primary rail line serving the prb 
maintenance to repair significant sections of track on this rail line began in and is expected to be completed by the end of these repairs must be completed before normal train operations from the prb can resume  which affects all users of prb coal 
approximately of kcp l s coal requirements come from the prb and originate on the burlington northern santa fe and the union pacific railroads  both of which have been affected by the current rail situation 
as a result  most utilities  including kcp l  have coal inventories that are below desired levels 
kcp l implemented coal conservation measures by reducing coal generation in and expects to continue these measures for at least the first half of this reduction in coal generation in the marketplace caused upward pressure on both pricing for next power generation fuel sources natural gas and or oil and wholesale electricity prices in and is expected to continue into the rail companies have indicated that they expect the impact related to the maintenance program to be less than the to reduction in deliveries experienced in  but have offered no estimate on the likely reduction 
management cannot predict with any certainty the impact of the situation  however  an inability to obtain timely delivery of coal to meet generation requirements could materially impact kcp l s results of operations 
management is monitoring the situation closely and steps will be taken  as necessary  to maintain an adequate energy supply for kcp l s retail load and firm mwh sales 
strategic energy business overview great plains energy owns just under of the indirect interest in strategic energy 
strategic energy does not own any generation  transmission or distribution facilities 
strategic energy provides competitive retail electricity supply services by entering into power supply contracts to supply electricity to its end use customers 
of the states that offer retail choice  strategic energy operates in california  maryland  massachusetts  michigan  new jersey  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and texas 
in addition to competitive retail electricity supply services  strategic energy records insignificant wholesale revenues and purchased power expense incidental to the retail services provided 
strategic energy also provides strategic planning  consulting and billing and scheduling services in the natural gas and electricity markets 
the cost of supplying electricity to retail customers can vary widely by geographic market 
this variability can be affected by many factors  including  but not limited to  geographic differences in the cost per mwh of purchased power  renewable energy requirements and capacity charges due to regional purchased power availability and requirements of other electricity providers and differences in transmission charges 
strategic energy provides services to approximately  commercial  institutional and small manufacturing accounts for approximately  customers including numerous fortune companies  smaller companies and governmental entities 
in response to marketplace trends  strategic energy has designed and introduced new products tailored for specific market conditions and segments 
strategic energy offers an array of products  including fixed price  index based and month to month renewal products  designed to meet the various requirements of a diverse customer base in evolving markets 
strategic energy s volume based customer retention rate  excluding month to month customers on market based rates  for was 
the corresponding volume based customer retention rate including month to month customers on market based rates was 
in some markets  wholesale power prices in rose faster than host utility rates 
in markets where this occurred  the savings competitive suppliers could offer to customers were reduced or in some markets were unavailable 
additionally  in those markets where wholesale power prices were lower than host utility rates  strategic energy faced strong competition from other competitive suppliers 
these factors  among others  contributed to reductions in mwhs delivered and average retail gross margin per mwh in compared to at the end of  strategic energy experienced improvement in certain key metrics  including strong backlog growth  longer contract durations and higher retention rates 
management believes a combination of factors contributed to the improved metrics  including successful focus on positioning  procurement  products and productivity  as well as a changing market environment 
customer perceptions about the longer term price of electricity may be changing as a result of the prolonged period of high and volatile power prices seen in the last few years and customers may be more willing to enter into long term contracts in order to achieve price certainty 
also  a decrease in near term power prices at the end of may have provided a catalyst for some customers to convert from month to month service to term contracts 
management believes  but cannot assure  that these trends may continue into strategic energy currently expects the retail gross margin per mwh retail revenues less retail purchased power divided by retail mwhs delivered delivered in to average to and the retail gross margin per mwh on new customer contracts entered into in to average from to 
strategic energy expects to realize additional retail gross margin on fixed price contracts of up to per mwh over the life of the contract 
the additional expected margin is derived from management of the retail portfolio load requirements 
these activities include benefits from financial transmission rights and auction revenue rights  short term load balancing activities  short term arbitrage activities and identifying and executing on favorable transmission paths 
mwhs delivered in are projected to range from to million 
based solely on expected usage under current signed contracts  strategic energy has forecasted future mwh commitments backlog of million  million and million for the years through  respectively 
strategic energy expects to deliver additional mwhs in these years through new and renewed term contracts and mwh deliveries to month to month customers 
lower earnings expected in great plains energy s projected net income is expected to decrease in the decrease in projected net income for is due to a significant increase in fuel cost and related transportation expenses at kcp l  lower volume and lower anticipated average retail gross margins at strategic energy and the absence of certain tax benefits recorded in these factors are expected to more than offset projected operational efficiencies at both kcp l and strategic energy  kcp l s retail load growth  higher wholesale volume and higher allowance for equity funds used during construction related to the comprehensive energy plan 
through  approximately of kcp l s current employees are eligible to retire with full pension benefits 
the timing and number of employees retiring and selecting the lump sum payment option could result in settlement charges that could materially affect kcp l s results of operations 
related party transactions see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding related party transactions 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been used could have a material impact on the results of operations and financial position 
management has identified the following accounting policies deemed critical to the understanding of the companies results of operations and financial position 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors for great plains energy and kcp l 
pensions the companies incur significant costs in providing non contributory defined pension benefits 
the costs are measured using actuarial valuations that are dependent upon numerous factors derived from actual plan experience and assumptions of future plan experience 
pension costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plan  earnings on plan assets and plan amendments 
in addition  pension costs are also affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
these actuarial assumptions are updated annually in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  the prevailing market rate of fixed income debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the benefit obligation was considered 
the assumed rate of return on plan assets was developed based on the weighted average of long term returns forecast for the expected portfolio mix of investments held by the plan 
these assumptions are based on management s best estimates and judgment  however  material changes may occur if these assumptions differ from actual events 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net costs 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a increase or a decrease in key actuarial assumptions 
each sensitivity reflects the impact of the change based solely on a change in that assumption only 
impact on impact on projected impact on change in benefit pension pension actuarial assumption assumption obligation liability expense millions discount rate increase rate of return on plan assets increase discount rate decrease rate of return on plan assets decrease kcp l recorded pension expense reflecting orders from the mpsc and kcc that established annual pension costs at million  reducing pension expense 
the difference between pension costs under sfas no 
and the amount allowed for ratemaking is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability for future ratemaking recovery or refunds  as appropriate 
see discussion of regulatory matters below and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the future assets and liabilities of the plan 
it is difficult to predict future pension costs  changes in pension liability and cash funding requirements due to volatile market conditions 
regulatory matters as a regulated utility  kcp l is subject to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
accordingly  kcp l has recorded assets and liabilities on its balance sheet resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process  which would not be recorded under gaap if kcp l were not regulated 
regulatory assets represent costs incurred that have been deferred because future recovery in customer rates is probable 
regulatory liabilities generally represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  but is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
future reductions in revenue or refunds for regulatory liabilities generally are not mandated  pending future rate proceedings or actions by the regulators 
management regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the mpsc  kcc or ferc on kcp l s rate case filings  decisions in other regulatory proceedings  including decisions related to other companies that establish precedence on matters applicable to kcp l  and changes in laws and regulations 
if recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations 
kcp l s continued ability to meet the criteria for application of sfas no 
may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry 
in the event that sfas no 
no longer applied to a deregulated portion of kcp l s operations  the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism is provided 
additionally  these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets as determined pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
impairment of assets  intangible assets and goodwill long lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are periodically reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under sfas no 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist as prescribed under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill must be compared with its carrying value to determine the amount of impairment 
impairment analyses require management to make assumptions about future sales  operating costs and discount rates over the life of the related asset  or in some cases over an indefinite life 
potential impairment indicators include such factors as current period losses combined with a history of losses  or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market price of the asset under review 
management s assumptions about these factors require significant judgment and under different assumptions  the fair value of an asset could be materially different 
accounting standards require a company to recognize an impairment in the current period results of operations if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from the company s asset is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the impairment recognized is the difference between the fair value and book value of the asset 
energy and energy related contract accounting strategic energy generally purchases power under forward physical delivery contracts to supply electricity to its retail energy customers under full requirement sales contracts 
the full requirements sales contracts and the forward physical delivery contracts meet the accounting definition of a derivative  however  strategic energy applies the normal purchases and normal sales npns exception accounting treatment on full requirement sales contracts 
derivative contracts designated as npns are accounted for by accrual accounting  which requires the effects of the derivative to be recorded when the underlying contract settles 
strategic energy has historically designated the majority of the forward physical delivery contracts as npns  however  as certain markets continue to develop  some derivative instruments may no longer qualify for the npns exception 
as such  strategic energy is designating these forward physical delivery contracts as cash flow hedges  which could result in future increased volatility in derivative assets and liabilities  other comprehensive income oci and net income 
under cash flow hedge accounting  the fair value of the contract is recorded as a current or long term derivative asset or liability 
subsequent changes in the fair value of the derivative assets and liabilities are recorded on a net basis in oci and subsequently reclassified to purchased power expense in great plains energy s consolidated statement of income as the power is delivered and or the contract settles 
accordingly  the increase in derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges and the corresponding decrease in derivatives accounted for as npns transactions may affect the timing and nature of accounting recognition  but does not change the underlying economics of the transactions 
the fair value of forward purchase derivative contracts that do not meet the requirements for the npns exception or cash flow hedge accounting are recorded as current or long term derivative assets or liabilities 
changes in the fair value of these contracts could result in operating income volatility as changes in the associated derivative assets and liabilities are recorded in purchased power expense in great plains energy s consolidated statement of income 
strategic energy s derivative assets and liabilities consist of a combination of energy and energy related contracts 
while some of these contracts represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices 
the market prices used to determine fair value reflect management s best estimate considering time  volatility and historical trends 
future market prices may vary from those used in recording energy assets and liabilities at fair value and such variations could be significant 
market prices for energy and energy related commodities vary based upon a number of factors 
changes in market prices will affect the recorded fair value of energy contracts 
changes in the fair value of energy contracts will affect operating income in the period of the change for contracts under fair value accounting and oci in the period of change for contracts under cash flow hedge accounting  while changes in forward market prices related to contracts under accrual accounting will affect operating income in future periods to the extent those prices are realized 
management cannot predict whether  or to what extent  the factors affecting market prices may change  but those changes could be material and could be either favorable or unfavorable 
great plains energy results of operations the following table summarizes great plains energy s comparative results of operations 
millions operating revenues fuel purchased power other operating expenses depreciation and amortization gain loss on property operating income non operating income expenses interest charges income taxes minority interest in subsidiaries loss from equity investments income from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income preferred dividends earnings available for common shareholders compared to great plains energy s earnings decreased to million  or per share  from million  or per share in a higher average number of common shares diluted eps by primarily due to the issuance of million shares in june consolidated kcp l s net income represented approximately of great plains energy s earnings and was relatively unchanged in compared to kcp l s net income decreased million primarily due to higher fuel costs and purchased power prices  as well as the effects of plant outages and coal conservation on fuel mix 
higher other operating expenses were partially offset by the regulatory accounting treatment of pension expense 
these decreases to net income were offset by retail revenues increasing as a result of significantly warmer summer weather in compared to an unusually mild summer in additionally  the favorable impact of sustained audit positions on the composite tax rates lowered income taxes 
kcp l s decrease was more than offset by million in reduced losses at hss primarily due to a impairment charge related to the sale of worry free 
strategic energy s net income decreased million in compared to retail mwhs delivered decreased in compared to the average retail gross margin per mwh declined to in the decline in average retail gross margin per mwh in compared to was primarily due to an environment of higher and less volatile energy prices  flat to higher forward electricity prices and seca charges in excess of recoveries 
the negative impacts on average retail gross margin per mwh were partially offset by two significant opportunities to manage retail portfolio load requirements  the favorable reduction of a gross receipts tax contingency and a favorable change in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 
strategic energy s income taxes decreased due to lower taxable income partially offset by million in lower tax benefits allocated from the holding company 
higher reductions in affordable housing investments and lower related tax credits decreased other non regulated operations net income in compared to by million 
discontinued operations decreased net income million in compared to  primarily due to a gain on the sale of the majority of the klt gas natural gas properties klt gas portfolio 
this gain was partially offset by losses from the wind down operations and a loss due to the write down of the klt gas portfolio to its estimated net realizable value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the discontinued operations 
compared to great plains energy s earnings increased to million  or per share  from million  or per share in a higher average number of common shares diluted eps by primarily due to the issuance of million shares in june consolidated kcp l s income from continuing operations increased million in compared to wholesale revenues increased as a result of increased generation  bundling transmission with energy and lower than expected retail loads during the summer months 
an increase in operating expenses more than offset these factors primarily due to the increase in mwhs generated  including higher coal and coal transportation costs  higher administrative expenses  an impairment charge related to the first quarter sale of worry free and the significant positive impact on of the hawthorn no 
litigation settlements 
income taxes decreased due to the favorable impact of state tax planning on the composite tax rate and the allocation of tax benefits from holding company losses pursuant to the company s intercompany tax allocation agreement 
the change in consolidated kcp l s discontinued operations was due to a million loss on the june disposition of hss interest in rsae and continuing losses through the date of disposition of million 
strategic energy s net income increased million in compared to retail mwhs delivered increased in compared to great plains energy  through iec  completed the purchase of an additional indirect interest in strategic energy resulting in a million increase in net income 
the increase to net income was partially offset by a decline in the average retail gross margin per mwh to in the decline in average retail gross margin was primarily due to the roll off of older  higher margin contracts  price discounts driven by a more competitive market and persistently higher commodity prices and a million increase in tax reserves 
the negative impacts on average retail gross margin per mwh were partially offset by a million change in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 
strategic energy s income taxes decreased million in compared to reflecting lower taxable income and additional tax benefits allocated from the holding company 
lower reductions in affordable housing investments and lower interest charges increased other non regulated operations net income in compared to by million

retail revenues decreased million in compared to primarily due to a million reduction in residential revenues 
residential usage per customer decreased in compared to as a result of significantly cooler summer weather in the kansas city area experienced one of the coolest summers in the past years  which resulted in cooling degree days below normal 
the impact of the cooler summer weather was partially offset by load growth in the average number of residential and commercial customers continues to grow  both increased to in and compared to the respective prior years 
wholesale revenues decreased million in compared to due to a decrease in mwhs sold  which was significantly offset by an increase in the average market price per mwh 
the decrease in mwhs sold was driven by a decrease in net mwhs generated as a result of coal conservation and plant outages 
additionally  retail mwh sales increased in compared to  which resulted in less mwhs available for wholesale sales 
average market price per mwh increased to in compared to due to warmer summer weather in  higher natural gas prices  transmission constraints and coal conservation in the region 
wholesale revenues increased million in compared to wholesale mwhs sold increased  primarily due to increased generation  bundling transmission with energy and lower than expected retail loads during the summer months  combined with successful marketing efforts 
average market prices per mwh increased to in compared to  primarily due to more sales made during periods of higher natural gas prices and bundling transmission with energy to provide a delivered product 
additionally  wholesale revenues were affected by the partial settlements of the hawthorn no 
litigation 
as described in item legal proceedings  kcp l filed suit against multiple defendants who are alleged to have responsibility for the hawthorn no 
boiler explosion 
various defendants settled with kcp l in this litigation  resulting in kcp l recording million and million in and  respectively 
a portion of the settlements  million and million for and  respectively  was recorded as a recovery of capital expenditures

millions wholesale revenues fuel purchased power operating income income taxes net income consolidated kcp l fuel and purchased power net mwhs generated by fuel type change change thousands coal nuclear natural gas and oil total generation fuel expense increased million in compared to despite a decrease in mwhs generated due to a combination of changes in the fuel mix to higher cost generation  increased coal and coal transportation costs and increased natural gas prices 
the changes in fuel mix were driven by the number and duration of plant outages as well as coal conservation measures 
kcp l s coal and coal transportation contracts were entered into at higher average prices than related contracts 
fuel expense increased million in compared to due to a increase in mwhs generated  higher coal and coal transportation costs  higher natural gas costs and the net effect of million from the hawthorn no 
partial litigation settlements 
the increase was partially offset by changes in the fuel mix to lower cost generation due to increased coal and nuclear fuel and less natural gas in the fuel mix 
the change in fuel mix was primarily due to the refueling outage at wolf creek and the cooler summer weather  which allowed coal and nuclear capacity to supply a greater percentage of the reduced retail load 
purchased power expense increased million in compared to the average price per mwh purchased increased in compared to partially offset by an decline in mwhs purchased 
the increased prices were driven by purchases during higher priced peak hours as a result of warmer weather  plant outages and overall higher average prices due to higher natural gas prices combined with transmission constraints  coal conservation and outages in the region 
purchased power expense decreased million in compared to mwhs purchased decreased in compared to primarily due to lower retail customer demand and a increase in the coal fleet equivalent availability factor in compared to the decrease in mwhs purchased was partially offset by an increase in the average price per mwh purchased in compared to primarily due to higher natural gas market prices and increased market demand 
another offset includes the net effect of the hawthorn no 
partial litigation settlements  which impacted purchased power expense by million in compared to consolidated kcp l other operating expenses including other operating  maintenance and general taxes consolidated kcp l s other operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the following increased employee related expenses of million including severance and incentive compensation  increased expenses of million due to higher legal reserves  increased regulatory expenses of million including expenses related to the comprehensive energy plan  increased general taxes of million mostly due to increases in gross receipts tax  assessed property valuations and mill levies  increased expenses of million due to higher restoration costs for a january ice storm and june wind storms compared to the wind storm restoration costs and increased production operations and maintenance expenses of million primarily due to scheduled and forced plant maintenance in and the reversal of an environmental accrual in partially offsetting the increase in other operating expenses was decreased pension expense of million due to the regulatory accounting treatment of pension expense in accordance with mpsc and kcc orders and decreased transmission service expense of million primarily due to lower wholesale mwhs sold 
consolidated kcp l s other operating expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the following increased pension expense of million primarily due to lower discount rates  the amortization of investment losses from prior years and plan settlement losses  increased other employee related costs of million including higher medical costs and incentive compensation costs  increased property taxes of million primarily due to increases in assessed property valuations and mill levies  increased outside services of million including costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance  increased transmission and distribution expenses including million primarily due to increased transmission usage charges as a result of the increased wholesale mwh sales  million related to spp administration and million in storm related expenses and increased office expense including million expenditure to buy out computer equipment operating leases 
partially offsetting the increase in other operating expenses was decreased plant maintenance expense of million primarily due to differences in timing and scope of outages and million in lower gross receipts taxes as a result of lower retail revenues and decreased expenses due to the reversal of an environmental accrual and the establishment of a regulatory asset for the probable recovery in the kansas jurisdiction of enhanced security costs 
consolidated kcp l gain loss on property consolidated kcp l s gain loss on property remained relatively unchanged in compared to  due to offsetting losses

see note to the consolidated financial statements for related legal proceedings 
consolidated kcp l s gain loss on property increased operating expenses million in compared to primarily due to the impairment charge related to the sale of worry free 
consolidated kcp l interest charges consolidated kcp l s interest charges decreased million in compared to primarily due to million of interest related to the irs audit settlement in consolidated kcp l s interest charges increased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to the million of interest discussed above  partially offset by a million decrease primarily due to the redemption of kcp l s million junior subordinated deferred interest bonds 
consolidated kcp l income taxes consolidated kcp l s income taxes decreased million in compared to several factors contributed to the decreased taxes including lower taxable income in the favorable impact of sustained audit positions on the composite tax rate decreased income taxes million  including million reflecting the composite tax rate change on deferred tax balances  and the domestic manufacturers deduction provided for under the american jobs creation act of contributed million to the decrease in taxes 
these decreases to income taxes were partially offset when compared to due to the million tax reserves release discussed below 
consolidated kcp l s income taxes decreased million in compared to several factors contributed to the decreased taxes including lower taxable income in the favorable impact of state tax planning on the composite tax rate decreased income taxes million  including million reflecting the composite tax rate change on deferred tax balances resulting from book to tax temporary differences 
an additional million decrease is attributable to the reserves for the interest component of the irs audit settlement  which offset interest expense and had no impact on income from continuing operations

the increase to net income was partially offset by a decline in the average retail gross margin per mwh to in the decline in average retail gross margin is primarily due to the roll off of older  higher margin contracts  price discounts driven by a more competitive market and persistently higher commodity prices and a million increase in tax reserves 
the negative impacts on average retail gross margin per mwh were partially offset by a million change in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 
strategic energy purchased power purchased power is the cost component of strategic energy s average retail gross margin 
strategic energy purchases blocks of electricity from power suppliers based on forecasted peak demand for its retail customers 
actual customer demand does not always equate to the volume included in blocks of purchased power 
consequently  strategic energy sells any excess retail electricity supply over actual customer requirements back into the wholesale market 
these sales occur on many contracts and are usually short term power sales day ahead and typically settle within the reporting period 
excess retail electricity supply sales also include long term forward physical sales to wholesale counterparties  which are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
strategic energy typically executes these transactions to manage basis and credit risks 
the proceeds from excess retail supply sales are recorded as a reduction of purchased power  as they do not represent the quantity of electricity consumed by strategic energy s customers 
the amount of excess retail supply sales that reduced purchased power was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
additionally  in certain markets  load serving entities are required to sell to and purchase power from a rto iso rather than directly transact with suppliers and end use customers 
the sale and purchase activity related to these certain rto iso markets is reflected on a net basis in strategic energy s purchased power 
strategic energy utilizes derivative instruments  including forward physical delivery contracts  in the procurement of electricity 
purchased power is also impacted by the net change in fair value related to non hedging energy contracts and from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness 
net changes in fair value reduced purchased power expenses by million in  million in and were insignificant for see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information

cash flows from operating activities great plains energy and consolidated kcp l generated positive cash flows from operating activities for the periods presented 
cash flows from operating activities for great plains energy and consolidated kcp l increased during compared to primarily due to kcp l s sales of so emission allowances totaling million and kcp l s million cash settlement on the t locks  discussed in significant financing activities 
kcp l s net income after consideration of non cash items decreased primarily due to the decrease in operating income discussed in consolidated kcp l s results of operations section 
the timing of the wolf creek outage affects the refueling outage accrual  deferred income taxes and amortization of nuclear fuel 
additionally  great plains energy s cash flows from operating activities reflects a decrease in strategic energy s net income due to fewer mwhs delivered and a decline in average retail gross margin per mwh 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities for great plains energy in compared to was primarily due to the changes in working capital detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the individual components of working capital vary with normal business cycles and operations 
in addition  the timing of the wolf creek outage affects the refueling outage accrual  deferred income taxes and amortization of nuclear fuel 
consolidated kcp l s cash flow from operating activities increased in compared to partially due to a million increase in net income and the changes in working capital detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows from investing activities great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s cash used for investing activities varies with the timing of utility capital expenditures and purchases of investments and nonutility property 
investing activities are offset by the proceeds from the sale of properties and insurance recoveries 
great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s utility capital expenditures increased million and million  respectively  during compared to kcp l exercised its early termination option in the combustion turbine synthetic lease and subsequently paid million to purchase the leased property and made contract payments totaling million related to wind generation and environmental equipment upgrades

strategic energy supplier concentration and credit strategic energy enters into forward physical contracts with multiple suppliers 
at december   strategic energy s five largest suppliers under forward supply contracts represented of the total future dollar committed purchases 
four of strategic energy s five largest suppliers  or their guarantors  are rated investment grade  and the non investment grade rated supplier collateralizes its position with strategic energy 
in the event of supplier non delivery or default  strategic energy s results of operations could be affected to the extent the cost of replacement power exceeded the combination of the contracted price with the supplier and the amount of collateral held by strategic energy to mitigate its credit risk with the supplier 
in addition to the collateral  if any  that the supplier provides  strategic energy s risk may be further mitigated by the obligation of the supplier to make a default payment equal to the shortfall and to pay liquidated damages in the event of a failure to deliver power 
there is no assurance that the supplier in such an instance would make the default payment and or pay liquidated damages 
strategic energy s results of operations could also be affected  in a given period  if it were required to make a payment upon termination of a supplier contract to the extent the contracted price with the supplier exceeded the market value of the contract at the time of termination

if a counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity  the determination has been based on the rating of its guarantor 
internal ratings are determined by  among other things  an analysis of the counterparty s financial statements and consideration of publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty s parent 
investment grade counterparties are those with a minimum senior unsecured debt rating of bbb from standard poor s or baa from moody s investors service 
exposure before credit collateral has been calculated considering all netting agreements in place  netting accounts payable and receivable exposure with net mark to market exposure 
exposure before credit collateral  after consideration of all netting agreements  is impacted significantly by the power supply volume under contract with a given counterparty and the relationship between current market prices and contracted power supply prices 
credit collateral includes the amount of cash deposits and letters of credit received from counterparties 
net exposure has only been calculated for those counterparties to which strategic energy is exposed and excludes counterparties exposed to strategic energy

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  great plains energy and consolidated kcp l face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable 
such risks principally include business  legal  operations and credit risks and are not represented in the following analysis 
see item a 
risk factors and item 
md a for further discussion of the companies risk factors 
great plains energy and consolidated kcp l are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply  interest rates and equity prices 
management has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects the volatility of the markets may have on its operating results 
during the normal course of business  under the direction and control of internal risk management committees  the companies hedging strategies are reviewed to determine the hedging approach deemed appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation 
though management believes its risk management practices to be effective  it is not possible to identify and eliminate all risk 
the companies could experience losses  which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position  due to many factors  including unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in the energy markets  from regulatory driven market rule changes and or bankruptcy or non performance of customers or counterparties 
derivative instruments are frequently utilized to execute risk management and hedging strategies 
derivative instruments  such as futures  forward contracts  swaps or options  derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts  which are referred to as over the counter derivatives and instruments listed and traded on an exchange 
the companies maintain commodity price risk management strategies that use derivative instruments to minimize significant  unanticipated net income fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility 
interest rate risk great plains energy and consolidated kcp l manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly rated financial institutions may be used to achieve the desired combination 
using outstanding balances and annualized interest rates as of december   a hypothetical increase in the interest rates associated with long term variable rate debt would result in an increase of less than million in interest expense for additionally  interest rates impact the fair value of long term debt 
also  kcp l had million of commercial paper outstanding at december  the principal amount  which will vary during the year  of the commercial paper will drive kcp l s commercial paper interest expense 
assuming that million of commercial paper was outstanding for all of  a hypothetical increase in commercial paper rates would result in an increase of less than million in interest expense for a change in interest rates would impact the company to the extent it redeemed any of its outstanding long term debt 
great plains energy s and consolidated kcp l s book values of long term debt were below fair values at december  commodity risk kcp l and strategic energy engage in the wholesale and retail marketing of electricity and are exposed to risk associated with the price of electricity 
kcp l s wholesale operations include the physical delivery and marketing of power obtained through its generation capacity and long  intermediate and short term capacity or power purchase agreements 
the agreements contain penalties for non performance to limit kcp l s energy price risk on the contracted energy 
kcp l also enters into additional power purchase agreements with the objective of obtaining the most economical energy to meet its physical delivery obligations to customers 
kcp l is required to maintain a capacity margin of at least of its peak summer demand 
this net positive supply of capacity and energy is maintained through its generation assets and capacity and power purchase agreements to protect it from the potential operational failure of one of its power generating units 
kcp l continually evaluates the need for additional risk mitigation measures in order to minimize its financial exposure to  among other things  spikes in wholesale power prices during periods of high demand 
kcp l s sales include the sales of electricity to its retail customers and bulk power sales of electricity in the wholesale market 
kcp l continually evaluates its system requirements  the availability of generating units  availability and cost of fuel supply  the availability and cost of purchased power and the requirements of other electric systems  therefore  the impact of the hypothetical amounts that follow could be significantly reduced depending on the system requirements and market prices at the time of the increases 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of power could result in a million decrease in operating income for related to purchased power 
in  approximately of kcp l s net mwhs generated are expected to be coal fired 
kcp l currently has all of its coal requirements for under contract 
a hypothetical increase in the market price of coal could result in less than a million increase in fuel expense for kcp l has also implemented price risk mitigation measures to reduce its exposure to high natural gas prices 
a hypothetical increase in natural gas and oil market prices could result in an increase of million in fuel expense for at december   kcp l did not have any of its projected natural gas usage for generation requirements to serve retail load and firm mwh sales hedged 
kcp l had slightly under half of its projected natural gas usage for generation requirements to serve retail load and firm mwh sales hedged at december  strategic energy maintains a commodity price risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments including forward physical energy purchases  to minimize significant  unanticipated net income fluctuations caused by commodity price volatility 
in certain markets where strategic energy operates  entering into forward fixed price contracts is cost prohibitive 
financial derivative instruments  including swaps  are used to limit the unfavorable effect that price increases will have on electricity purchases  effectively fixing the future purchase price of electricity for the applicable forecasted usage and protecting strategic energy from significant price volatility 
a hypothetical increase in the cost of purchased power could result in less than million increase in purchased power expense for strategic energy has historically utilized certain derivative instruments to protect against significant price volatility for purchased power that have qualified for the npns exception  in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended 
however  as certain markets continue to develop  some derivative instruments may no longer qualify for the npns exception 
as such  strategic energy is designating these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  where appropriate  which could result in future increased volatility in derivative assets and liabilities  oci and net income above levels historically experienced 
derivative instruments that were designated as npns are accounted for by accrual accounting  which requires the effects of the derivative to be recorded when the derivative contract settles 
accordingly  the increase in derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges  and the corresponding decrease in derivatives accounted for as npns transactions  may affect the timing and nature of accounting recognition  but does not change the underlying economics of the transactions 
investment risk kcp l maintains trust funds  as required by the nrc  to fund its share of decommissioning the wolf creek nuclear power plant 
as of december   these funds were invested primarily in domestic equity securities and fixed income securities and are reflected at fair value on kcp l s balance sheets 
the mix of securities is designed to provide returns to be used to fund decommissioning and to compensate for inflationary increases in decommissioning costs  however  the equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the value of fixed rate fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates resulting in a hypothetical decrease in the value of the fixed income securities would have resulted in a million reduction in the value of the decommissioning trust funds at december  a hypothetical decrease in equity prices would have resulted in a million reduction in the fair value of the equity securities at december  kcp l s exposure to investment risk associated with the decommissioning trust funds is in large part mitigated due to the fact that kcp l is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs in its rates 
klt investments has affordable housing notes that require the greater of of the outstanding note balances or the next annual installment to be held as cash  cash equivalents or marketable securities 
a hypothetical decrease in market prices of the securities held as collateral could result in a decrease of less than million in pre tax net income for
