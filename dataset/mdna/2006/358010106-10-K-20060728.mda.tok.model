in fiscal year  revenues from space systems loral ss l were million or of consolidated sales 
during the three years ended april   sales to motorola and lucent were made by the company s commercial communications segment  accounting for in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year of that segment s total sales 
fiscal year sales by the commercial communications segment to ss loral were of the segment s total sales 
fiscal year revenues in the us government segment included sales to four customers  northrop grumman corporation northrop  raytheon missile systems  inc raytheon  bae systems aerospace  inc

these european telecommunication companies accounted for  and  respectively  of the segment s revenues in those fiscal years 
in fiscal year  computer sciences corporation csc and l communications accounted for of revenues in the fei zyfer segment  in fiscal year  northrop and csc accounted for of the revenues in the fei zyfer segment  and in fiscal year  general dynamics accounted for of the revenues in the fei zyfer segment 
the loss by the company of any one of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company believes its relationship with these companies to be mutually satisfactory and is not aware of any prospect for the cancellation or significant reduction of any of its commercial or existing us government contracts 
the company purchases a variety of components such as transistors  resistors  capacitors  connectors and diodes for use in the manufacture of its products 
the company is not dependent upon any one supplier or source of supply for any of its component part purchases and maintains alternative sources of supply for all of its purchased components 
the company has found its suppliers generally to be reliable and price competitive 
research and development the company s technological expertise continues to be an important factor to support future growth in revenues and earnings 
the company has focused its internal research and development efforts on improving the core physics and electronic packages in its time and frequency products  conducting research to develop new time and frequency technologies  improving product manufacturability by seeking to reduce its production costs through product redesign and process improvements and other measures to take advantage of lower cost components 
the company continues to focus a significant portion of its own resources and efforts on developing hardware for satellite commercial and us government and terrestrial commercial communications systems  including wireless  wireline and gps related systems 
during fiscal years  and  the company expended million  million and million of its own funds  respectively  on such research and development activity 
see also item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for fiscal year  the company is targeting to spend approximately million on research and development in similar areas 
the actual amount spent will depend on market conditions and identification of new opportunities 
patents and licenses the company believes that for the most part its business is not dependent on patent or license protection 
rather  it is primarily dependent upon the company s technical competence  the quality of its products and its prompt and responsible contract performance 
however  employees working for the company assign all rights to inventions to the company and the company presently holds such patents and licenses 
in certain limited circumstances  the us government may use or permit the use by the company s competitors of certain patents or licenses the government has funded 
during fiscal year  the company received a broad and significant patent for new  proprietary quartz oscillator technology which the company intends to exploit in both legacy and new applications 
competition the company experiences competition in all areas of its business 
the company competes primarily on the basis of the accuracy  performance and reliability of its products  the ability of its products to function under severe conditions  such as in space or other extreme hostile environments  prompt and responsive contract performance  technical competence and price 
the company has a unique and broad product line which includes all three frequency standards quartz  rubidium  and cesium 
because of the very high precision of certain of its products  the company has few competitors 
for lower precision components there is significant competition from a number of suppliers 
in recent years  the company has successfully outsourced certain component manufacturing processes to third parties and more recently to its wholly owned subsidiary  fei asia in tianjin  china and to russian based morion  inc  in which the company is a minority shareholder 
the company expects this outsourcing to enhance its competitive position on cost while maintaining its high quality standards 
the company believes its ability to obtain raw materials  manufacture finished products  integrate them into systems and sub systems and interface these systems with end user applications provides a strong competitive advantage 
certain of the company s competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have larger research and development and marketing staffs 
the company has a strong history of competing successfully in this environment due to the quality  reliability and outstanding record of performance its products have achieved 
with respect to its instruments and systems  the company competes with hewlett packard company  symmetricom  inc  e 
g 
and g  inc and others 
systems for the wireline industry produced by the gillam fei segment compete with symmetricom  inc the company s principal competition for space products is the in house capability of its major customers

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k and the exhibits hereto  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company s business 
additional risks not presently known to the company or that the company currently deems immaterial may also adversely affect its business  financial condition  or results of operations 
a variety of factors may cause the price of the company s stock to be volatile 
in recent years  the stock market in general  and the market for shares of technology companies in particular  including frequency electronics  have experienced price fluctuations 
for example  for fiscal year  the price of the company s common stock ranged from a closing high of to a closing low of 
the market price of the company s common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future  including fluctuations unrelated to its performance 
the company believes that fluctuations of its stock price may be caused by a variety of factors  including o fluctuations in the company s operating results  o announcements of technological innovations  new commercial products or other developments by the company or its competitors  o published reports by securities analysts  o general market conditions  general economic conditions  o announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships or joint ventures  o the company s cash position and cash commitments  o additions or departures of key personnel  o sales or purchases of the company s common stock in the marketplace  o an outbreak of hostilities  diseases  natural disasters or terrorism  o developments in patents or other intellectual property rights  and o developments in the company s relationships with customers and suppliers 
if the company fails to keep pace with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards  its products could become less competitive or obsolete 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by technological change  new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
the company may cease to be competitive if it fails to timely introduce new products or product enhancements that address these factors 
to continue to introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis  the company must o identify emerging technological trends in the company s target markets  o accurately define and design new products or product enhancements to meet market needs  o develop or license the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and product enhancements  and o respond effectively to technological changes and product introductions by the company s competitors 
if the company fails to timely identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully  its competitors could gain market share or its new or enhanced products might not gain market acceptance 
delays in the development of new or enhanced products could harm the company s operating results and its competitive position 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  highly skilled engineering and development personnel and accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
consequently  product development delays are typical in the company s industry 
if the company fails to timely introduce a product for an emerging standard or customers defer or cancel orders expecting the release of a new or enhanced product  its operating results could suffer 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including o changing product specifications and customer requirements  o unanticipated engineering complexities  o difficulties with or delays by contract manufacturers or suppliers of key components or technologies  o difficulties in allocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  and o difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel 
the company faces uncertainty relating to economic conditions affecting its customers 
the company faces uncertainty in the degree to which the current global economic climate will affect the rate of growth for its existing and potential customers 
in particular  the timing and magnitude of capital spending by international telecommunications companies  including those in china  will materially impact the company s business 
frequency electronics may experience instances of customers delaying or deferring orders and longer lead times to close sales 
similarly  spending on us government programs is determined by the annual defense department budget 
to the extent that support for the liberation and rebuilding of iraq takes precedence  funding for certain department of defense programs may be delayed or significantly reduced in the near term 
such delays can have a materially negative impact on the company s business  its operating results and financial condition 
the company faces competition 
its inability to remain competitive in the industry would adversely affect the company s ability to maintain its current sales and growth 
the company experiences competition in all areas of its business 
frequency electronics competes primarily on the basis of the accuracy  performance and reliability of its products  the ability of its products to function under severe conditions  such as in space or other extreme hostile environments  prompt and responsive contract performance  technical competence and price 
the company has a unique and broad product line which includes all three frequency standards quartz  rubidium  and cesium 
for its high precision products  the company has few competitors  but for lower precision components  the company faces significant competition from a number of suppliers 
certain of the company s competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have larger research and development and marketing staffs 
if its competitors develop more accurate or reliable products  or otherwise improve their products  frequency electronics could experience a decline in its sales or loss of market acceptance of its products 
with respect to the company s instruments and systems  it competes with hewlett packard company  symmetricom  inc  e 
g 
and g  inc and others 
systems for the wireline industry produced by the gillam fei segment compete with symmetricom  inc frequency electronics principal competition for space products is the in house capability of its major customers 
the company s reliance on third parties could materially adversely affect its business 
in recent years  the company has outsourced certain component manufacturing processes to third parties and more recently to its wholly owned subsidiary  fei asia in tianjin  china and to russian based morion  inc  in which the company is a minority shareholder 
the company expects this outsourcing to enhance its competitive position on cost while maintaining its high quality standards 
any unanticipated changes in such third parties ability to perform the component manufacturing processes or any delay in such manufacturing could materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s executive officers and certain key personnel are critical to its business 
the company s future success is dependent upon the contributions of its senior corporate management team  particularly martin bloch  president and chief executive officer  who has been with the company since  markus hechler  executive vice president  who has been with the company since  oleandro mancini  vice president of business development  who has been with the company since and certain other key employees 
if messrs 
bloch  hechler and mancini no longer serve in their positions  the company s business  financial conditions and results of operation could be substantially adversely affected 
the company s future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management  manufacturing  technical  engineering  marketing  sales and support personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and the company cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel 
there may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions and it may be increasingly difficult for the company to hire personnel over time 
the company s business  financial conditions and results of operation could be substantially adversely affected by its inability to attract and retain skilled employees 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect sales 
because the company sells its products worldwide  its business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
the company recognized of its revenue from sales to end users in countries located outside of the united states in the fiscal year ended april  the company anticipates that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of its revenue 
in addition  several of the company s manufacturers facilities and suppliers are located outside the united states of america 
accordingly  the company s future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including o changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  o tariff and trade policies  o export license requirements and restrictions of the export of technology  o import regulations  o domestic and foreign tax policies  o foreign governmental regulations  o difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  o ongoing health epidemics eg  bird flu  o fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  o stability of international monetary conditions  o differing labor regulations  o political unrest  war  actual or threatened acts of terrorism  other international conflicts and the resulting military  economic and political responses including  without limitation  war between sovereign nations as well as heightened security measures which may cause significant disruption to commerce worldwide  o differing protection of intellectual property  and o unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
the company s products may contain defects that cause it to incur significant corrective costs  divert its attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers 
highly complex products such as the company s high technology frequency  timing and synchronization products may contain defects when they are installed in its customers systems 
if any of the company s products contain defects or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  its reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy its products 
in addition  these defects could interrupt or delay sales 
the company may have to invest significant capital and other resources to alleviate these problems 
if any problem remains undiscovered until after the company has commenced production of a new product  it may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against the company by its customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert the company s technical and other resources from other development efforts 
if the company fails to manage its operations effectively  its business could suffer 
the company s ability to offer products and implement its business plan successfully in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning and management 
failure by the company s management or personnel to properly allocate resources to meet its current and existing needs as well as unforeseen complications and inefficiencies in planning its operations can adversely impact the morale of the company s personnel and lead to further complications and operational inefficiencies 
if this were to occur  the company s profitability or financial position could be negatively impacted and its operating results could suffer 
claims that the company infringed third party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on its ability to sell its products 
although the company s industry is not characterized by frequent claims or litigation regarding patent rights  the company cannot be certain that its products do not or will not infringe issued patents or the intellectual property rights of others 
historically  patent applications in the united states of america have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  and the company may not be aware of filed patent applications that relate to its products or technology 
if patents are later issued in connection with these applications  the company may be liable for infringement 
periodically  other parties  including some of the company s competitors  may assert patent  copyright and other rights to technologies in various jurisdictions that are important to its business 
any claims asserting that the company s products infringe or may infringe the rights of third parties  including claims arising through its contractual indemnification of its customers  regardless of their merit or resolution  would likely be costly and time consuming  divert the efforts of the company s technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays or require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
at present  the company does not believe that its products infringe any other party s intellectual property rights in any way that would have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
however  if any material claims do arise and if these claims cannot be resolved through a license or similar arrangement  the company could become a party to litigation 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with third parties that could arise in the future  the company could be required to pay substantial damages  including treble damages if it is held to have willfully infringed  to cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  or to obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
in addition  lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention from the company s business 
any failure to protect the company s intellectual property adequately may significantly harm its business 
the company protects its proprietary processes  software  know how and other intellectual property and related rights through copyrights  patents  trademarks and the maintenance of trade secrets  including entering into confidentiality agreements 
the company s success and ability to compete depends in part on its proprietary technology 
however  the company cannot provide any assurance that other companies will not develop technologies that are similar to its technology 
although the company has patent applications pending  patents may not issue as a result of these or other patent applications 
any patents that ultimately issue may be successfully challenged or invalidated  or may not provide the company with a significant competitive advantage 
despite the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights  existing laws in the united states of america and in differing international jurisdictions and its contractual arrangements provide only limited protection 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use the company s products or technology 
third parties may breach confidentiality agreements or other protective contracts with the company and it may not be able to enforce its rights in the event of these breaches 
monitoring unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult and may be expensive  and the company cannot be certain that the steps it has taken will prevent unauthorized use of its intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect the company s proprietary rights as fully as in the united states of america 
the company may be required to spend significant resources to protect its intellectual property rights  including pursuing remedies in court 
frequency electronics may become involved in legal proceedings against other parties  which may also cause other parties to assert claims against it 
in the future the company may not be able to detect infringements and may lose its competitive position in its markets before it does so 
in addition  competitors may design around the company s technologies or develop competing technologies 
the laws of other countries in which the company markets its products might offer little or no effective protection of its proprietary technology 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of the company s proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from its technology without payment  which could significantly harm the company s business 
the company s failure to enforce and protect its intellectual property rights or any adverse change in the laws protecting intellectual property rights could harm its business 
furthermore  the company may become involved in legal proceedings against other parties  which may also cause other parties to assert claims against it 
future sales of substantial amounts of the company s common stock by it or by its existing stockholders could cause the company s stock price to fall 
additional equity financings or other share issuances by the company could adversely affect the market price of its common stock 
sales by existing stockholders of a large number of shares of frequency electronics common stock in the public trading market or in private transactions such as this offering by the selling stockholders  or the perception that such additional sales could occur  could cause the market price of the company s common stock to drop 
some of the company s revenue is generated from a limited number of key customers and the loss of a key customer could substantially reduce its revenues 
a large portion of the company s sales are generated from a small number of key customers at each of the company s segments  including  without limitation  three customers of the commercial communications segment  space systems loral  lucent technologies and motorola corp  which accounted for  and of consolidated sales for fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal year  northrop  raytheon  bae and the air force space and missile center were significant customers of the company s us government segment  france telecom and belgacom were significant customers of the company s gillam fei segment  and computer sciences corporation and l communications were significant customers of the fei zyfer segment 
the company s top customers accounted for of its consolidated sales for fiscal year the company expects that its top customers in the aggregate will continue to account for a large portion of its consolidated sales in the foreseeable future  and the loss of one or more of these customers would materially harm the company s business and operating results 
the loss of a key customer could also be perceived as a loss of momentum in the company s business and an adverse impact on its financial results  and this may cause the market price of the company s common stock to fall 
the company is subject to anti takeover provisions that could delay or prevent an acquisition of the company the company is subject to the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of frequency electronics 
these factors could materially adversely affect the price of the company s common stock

each of these areas requires the company to make use of reasonable estimates including estimating the cost to complete a contract  the realizable value of its inventory or the market value of its products 
changes in estimates can have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenues under larger  long term contracts which generally require billings based on achievement of milestones rather than delivery of product  are reported in operating results using the percentage of completion method 
on fixed price contracts  which are typical for commercial and us government satellite programs and other long term us government projects  and which require initial design and development of the product  revenue is recognized on the cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs bear to total estimated contract costs with related cost of sales recorded as the costs are incurred 
each month management reviews estimated contract costs 
the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in revenues in the period in which the change is known 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are made in the period in which they become determinable 
on production type orders  revenue is recorded as units are delivered with the related cost of sales recognized on each shipment based upon a percentage of estimated final program costs 
changes in job performance may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined to be required 
provisions for anticipated losses on customer orders are made in the period in which they become determinable 
for customer orders in the company s gillam fei and fei zyfer segments or smaller contracts or orders in the other business segments  sales of products and services to customers are reported in operating results based upon i shipment of the product or ii performance of the services pursuant to terms of the customer order 
when payment is contingent upon customer acceptance of the installed system  revenue is deferred until such acceptance is received and installation completed 
costs and expenses contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs  manufacturing overhead and other direct costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
inventory in accordance with industry practice  inventoried costs contain amounts relating to contracts and programs with long production cycles  a portion of which will not be realized within one year 
inventory reserves are established for slow moving and obsolete items and are based upon management s experience and expectations for future business 
any changes in reserves arising from revised expectations are reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
equity based compensation through fiscal year  the company applied the disclosure only provisions of fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and continues to measure compensation cost in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
historically  this has not resulted in compensation cost upon the grant of options under a qualified stock option plan 
however  in accordance with fas no 
 the company provides pro forma disclosures of net income loss and income loss per share as if the fair value method had been applied beginning in fiscal the following table illustrates the effect on the company s consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended april  had compensation cost for stock option awards under the plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates consistent with the provisions of fas no 
in thousands  except per share data net income  as reported   cost of stock options  net of taxes net income loss pro forma   income per share  as reported basic diluted income loss per share pro forma basic diluted the weighted average fair value of each option has been estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in each of the three years ended april   and  dividend yield of  and  expected volatility of  and  risk free interest rate of  and  and expected lives of six and one half years  respectively 
results of operations the table below sets forth for the fiscal years ended april the percentage of consolidated net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations net sales commercial communications us government gillam fei fei zyfer less intersegment sales cost of sales gross margin selling and administrative expenses compensation charges research and development expenses operating profit loss other income  net minority interest provision for income taxes net income significant events as more thoroughly described elsewhere in this form k and in the notes to the financial statements  the company s fiscal year  and results of operations were materially impacted by several specific events 
during fiscal year  the company recognized gains on the sale of certain assets million from additional sales of shares of reckson associates realty corp 
common stock reit stock see item properties  note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and comments in the following paragraph and a gain of  upon the sale of a manufacturing facility owned by one of its european subsidiaries 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal year  the company recorded a gain of million on the conversion of its real estate operating partnership units reit units into shares of reit stock  thus completing a transaction which was initiated in fiscal year subsequent to the conversion  the company sold a portion of the reit stock and realized additional gains of approximately million  or total pretax gains of approximately million 
as a result of these gains  the company also accrued a contractually mandated incentive compensation expense of  which amount is included in operating expenses under the caption compensation charges 
during fiscal year  the company acquired the business and net assets of zyfer  inc in addition to the purchase price  the company invested an additional million of working capital to support the operations of fei zyfer until it could return to profitability 
also  in fiscal year  the company realized a  tax benefit as the result of the reversal of certain tax liabilities established in prior years 
without these significant events  the company s operating profit loss  pre tax income and net income would be materially different from that reported in the financial statements 
operating profit loss fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  change change    nm   nm not meaningful for the fiscal year ended april   the company realized an operating profit of million compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal year this substantial improvement in operating results was the result of several factors including improved gross margins  lower compensation related charges and lower discretionary spending on research and development 
the operating loss for the fiscal year ended april   decreased to million from a million operating loss for fiscal year the improvement is attributable to the year over year increase in sales coupled with improved gross margins but offset by higher selling and administrative costs  compensation charges and research and development expenditures 
the research and development expenditures represent investments that keep the company s products at the leading edge of time and frequency technology and enhance competitiveness for future sales 
net sales fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  in millions change change commercial communications us government gillam fei fei zyfer intersegment sales for the year ended april   revenues of the commercial communications segment declined primarily as a result of a decrease in revenues related to wireless telecommunication infrastructure spending 
this decline was partially offset by a doubling in revenues from commercial satellite projects 
revenues related to us government programs increased by as the company began new programs primarily for us government satellite programs 
revenues for gillam fei exclusive of intercompany sales of  in fiscal year and million in fiscal year related to a research and development program decreased by million or  as a number of wireline synchronization projects were postponed by its customers 
fei zyfer continued to show year over year improvement in revenues as the segment introduced new products and continued to solidify its position with its customer base 
in fiscal year  sales increases were experienced in three of the company s four segments over the fiscal year results 
commercial communications revenues increased largely on increased revenues from commercial space programs 
gillam fei revenues exclusive of intercompany sales of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year related to a research and development program improved by million of which approximately is attributable to appreciation in the value of the euro to the dollar during fiscal year fei zyfer s revenues continued the improvements which began in the second half of fiscal year after the company acquired it and stabilized its operations 
these sales gains were offset by a decline in revenues from us government programs as the company worked on several smaller dollar development contracts versus higher volume production programs in prior years 
during fiscal year  based on current backlog and current proposal activity  the company expects to again realize significant revenues from commercial and us government satellite programs 
in addition  the company s recent work on us government sponsored development contracts and current proposal activity should generate increased revenues from us government programs such as secure radios  new communication satellites  unmanned aerial vehicles  weapons guidance systems and secure communications 
the timing and magnitude of revenues from these sources is dependent on the us government s procurement and budgeting process 
the expected increased revenue stream will benefit the company s fiscal year fei ny segment the combination of the commercial communications and us government segments and the fei zyfer segment 
demand for the company s products by wireless infrastructure original equipment manufacturers  has fluctuated in recent years 
demand peaked during the company s fourth quarter of fiscal year and through the first quarter of fiscal year this was followed by sequential declines in the subsequent quarters of fiscal year and the first half of fiscal year as end users postponed deployment of next generation cellular base stations 
the company continues to believe  however  that the world wide market for its synchronization products for the wireless industry  particularly in china  remains large and will grow 
the company anticipates that some of this growth will materialize during mid to late fiscal year which should result in increased revenues for the commercial communications to become the fei ny segment 
in addition  the company expects that world wide capital spending on wireline synchronization systems will increase as older systems are upgraded or replaced 
accordingly  the company believes future sales in the gillam fei segment will increase over the level achieved in fiscal year gross margin rates fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  change change gm rate for the year ended april   gross margin improved by over the prior year even though the level of sales decreased by from fiscal year this result was achieved through better utilization of resources and product mix which was partially offset by developmental and technical issues that the company experienced during fiscal year with respect to two long term contracts 
the gross margin rate for fiscal year improved to of net sales compared to in fiscal year the improvement is primarily attributable to increased revenue in fiscal year which was able to absorb a greater share of fixed costs 
gross margin improvements were partially offset by additional work required on certain space programs to address technical issues encountered at the near conclusion of these programs 
the company s target is to achieve an overall gross margin rate of or better through greater sales volume  continued process improvements  better performance on long term contracts and utilization of lower cost manufacturing in russia and china 
during fiscal year  if revenues increase as anticipated  the company expects to realize gross margin rates approaching its targeted rate 
compensation charges fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  change change nm under the caption compensation charges  the company has recorded certain expenses which are defined as operating expenses which are not expected to recur 
there were no material non recurring expenses in fiscal year as indicated above  during fiscal year the company accrued a  incentive compensation expense related to the conversion and sale of reit units 
in addition  the company recorded a non cash charge of  to increase the liability under its deferred compensation plan 
this charge was based on updated life expectancy charts utilized by the company s actuary 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company s belgian subsidiary recorded an accrual for  related to litigation with a former employee 
during fiscal year  the company s majority owned subsidiary in france substantially completed a restructuring of its operations as a result of the company s decision to convert it from a manufacturing facility to a regional sales office 
this resulted in a charge to earnings of  consisting primarily of employee severance costs  for the year ended april  in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  in connection with an employment agreement initiated in  the company awarded its chairman of the board and former ceo a stock bonus of  shares which had a value of approximately  selling and administrative expenses fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  change change for the year ended april   selling and administrative costs declined by compared to fiscal year  as a result of lower compensation costs  including incentive compensation charges  reduced deferred compensation expense  lower sales commission expense and substantially reduced fees for professional and consulting services as prior year projects were concluded 
these cost reductions were partially offset by increased recruiting and employee retention expenses 
the increase in selling and administrative costs in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  was a result of larger deferred compensation expense exclusive of the charge included in compensation charges  increased salaries for support personnel  information technology consulting fees as the company upgraded its erp system and higher professional fees related to the company s efforts to comply with the provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of these expenses were partially offset by savings obtained from the mid year closing of the company s european sales office and merging those functions into the company s belgian subsidiary 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses were in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year the company targets selling and administrative expenses not to exceed of consolidated sales 
as revenues increase as anticipated in fiscal year  the company expects to achieve its targeted level of selling and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  change change research and development expenditures represent investments that keep the company s products at the leading edge of time and frequency technology and enhance competitiveness for future sales 
for the year ended april   research and development expenditures decreased by from the level of spending in fiscal year the decline resulted from decreased spending on development of the new usg wireline synchronization product  which is near completion  but was offset by new initiatives in developing a ruggedized rubidium clock for secure military communications  enhancing and miniaturizing products for wireless communications  upgrading its gps based synchronization product line  and developing enhanced network monitoring equipment and software 
research and development expenses in fiscal year increased over fiscal year as the company devoted significant resources to completion of its usg unit for deployment in the u 
s 
and associated products for wireline synchronization  developed new hardware for space applications and further enhanced the performance of low g gravity sensitivity oscillators which have broad applications in both commercial and us government systems 
the company will continue to focus its research and development activities on those products which it expects will provide the best return on investment and greatest prospects for the future growth of the company 
for fiscal year  the company will make investments to develop related products for its new usg wireline synchronization products and make manufacturing process improvements  invest in development of a broader range of space based components and systems  improve and miniaturize rubidium atomic clocks  develop new gps based synchronization products and further enhance the capabilities of its line of crystal oscillators 
the company s target is to spend approximately of revenues on research and development activities  although the actual level of spending is dependent on new opportunites and the rate at which it succeeds in bringing new products to market 
internally generated cash and cash reserves will be adequate to fund these development efforts 
other income expense fiscal to fiscal fiscal to fiscal years ended april  change change investment income      equity in morion interest expense other  net      nm with respect to other income and expense  the principal difference between the three fiscal years is the conversion of reit units for reit stock in fiscal and the subsequent partial sale of these shares in fiscal years and  as described above under significant events 
see item properties and note to the accompanying financial statements 
investment income in both fiscal years and contained gains of million and million  respectively  on the sale of reit stock 
gains on sales of other marketable securities in fiscal year were less than  by comparison 
investment income also includes interest and dividend income on marketable securities 
income from this source decreased in fiscal year since the company no longer receives dividend income from its former investment in reit stock 
this decline was partially offset by increased interest income on a higher level of bond investments and increasing interest rates 
the company anticipates that during fiscal year it will realize lower income from investments 
the primary source of income for this category will be from interest income on its bond portfolio 
while more interest will be earned on rising interest rates  the company does not anticipate realizing any substantial investment gains 
the company began to record equity income in morion  inc during the second quarter of fiscal year  when the company increased its ownership interest in morion to of morion s outstanding shares 
accordingly  the company changed its method of accounting from the cost to the equity method and restated fiscal year financial statements to reflect the appropriate accounting method 
the increase in equity income from morion for fiscal year over fiscal year and fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due to two factors a the increased profitability of morion during the year ended april  compared to the year ago period and b during the first five months of fiscal year the company held only of morion s shares and equity income was recorded at this lower rate for that period as well as for all of fiscal year interest expense for the year ended april   decreased as a result of the gain realized on the conversion of reit units to reit stock 
prior to the conversion  the financing arrangement for the sale and leaseback of the us manufacturing facility was considered as debt on which interest expense was recorded 
in addition  with the proceeds from the reit stock sale  the company repaid the outstanding balance on its credit line 
the company also incurred interest expense on and for certain deferred compensation payments which also declined in fiscal year on lower interest rates 
the decline in interest expense for fiscal year is due to the paydown during the year of both short term and long term credit obligations 
the company anticipates that interest expense in fiscal year will be approximately the same as that recorded in fiscal year  depending on the trend in interest rates 
as indicated in the significant events section above  in fiscal year  the company sold the building formerly owned by its french subsidiary 
following the fiscal year staffing cutbacks in this entity  the building had been largely vacant and available for sale 
upon receipt of an independent appraisal  the building was sold to the president of the company s subsidiary  gillam fei 
the company realized a gain on the sale of the building of approximately  which is included in the caption other  net 
in addition  during fiscal year  the company recognized  of income from amortization of the deferred gain from the sale of its corporate headquarters building in new york 
the deferred gain is being amortized over the remaining life of the original eleven year lease 
for the year ended april   other  net includes a million gain on the conversion of the reit units to reit stock 
see item properties and note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this gain was offset by certain recurring  non operating expenses 
in fiscal year  other  net was an expense of  resulting primarily from certain one time charges at the company s french subsidiary 
in future fiscal years  other  net will include annual amortization into income of the final  deferred gain on the sale of its building 
using the straightline method over the remaining months of the initial leaseback period  the company will recognize approximately  of amortized income during fiscal year the company anticipates that in future years other items in this category will not be significant to pretax earnings 
income taxes the company is subject to taxation in several countries 
the statutory federal rates vary from in the united states to in europe 
the effective rate for the company for the year ended april  was  compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the effective rate is impacted by the income or loss of certain of the company s european and asian subsidiaries which are currently not taxed 
in addition  the company utilizes the availability of research and development tax credits in the united states to lower its tax rate 
in fiscal year  the company reversed certain tax liabilities which had been established in prior years to cover certain tax contingencies 
during fiscal year  the company s income tax returns were examined by the internal revenue service and no changes were required for the years under audit 
accordingly  the tax liabilities established for the audited years were no longer required and the reversal of such tax liabilities were recorded as a tax benefit in fiscal year see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s european subsidiaries have available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
these loss carryforwards have no expiration date 
liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet continues to reflect a highly liquid position with working capital of million at april  included in working capital at april  is million consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company s current ratio at april  is to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended april   was million compared to cash provided by operations of million in fiscal year the primary cause for the decrease in cash was the payment in fiscal year of approximately million in income taxes on non operating gains recorded at the end of fiscal year this payment was deferred in the prior year  contributing to positive operating cash flow in that period 
the company had anticipated generating positive cash flow in fiscal year despite the large income tax payments but was prevented from doing so due to the timing of certain milestone billings under long term contracts 
the billings and cash collection could not be made until after the end of the fiscal year  which also accounts for the growth in the company s accounts receivable 
see note to the accompanying financial statements 
net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended april   was  approximately million was generated by the sale or maturity of certain marketable securities  including reit stock  net of purchases of other marketable securities 
an additional  was received on the sale of the company s building in france

during fiscal year  the company made additional investments in fei zyfer and morion  inc which aggregated  and acquired capital equipment of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended april   was million 
approximately million was generated by the sale or maturity of certain marketable securities  primarily reit stock  net of purchases of other marketable securities 
the company also made additional investments in fei zyfer  satel fei and morion  inc which aggregated  and acquired capital equipment of million 
net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended april   was  approximately million was generated by the sale or maturity of certain marketable securities  net of purchases 
most of this cash was used to acquire fei zyfer for million excludes  of acquisition expenses paid in fiscal year and to provide additional working capital support for this subsidiary as indicated above 
see note to the accompanying financial statements 
approximately million was used to acquire additional capital equipment 
the company may continue to invest cash equivalents in longer term securities or to convert short term investments to cash equivalents as dictated by its investment and acquisition strategies 
the company will continue to acquire more efficient equipment to automate its production process 
it intends to spend approximately million on capital equipment during fiscal year internally generated cash will be adequate to acquire this capital equipment 
in fiscal year  the company established a million line of credit with the financial institution which also manages a substantial portion of its investment in marketable securities 
the line is secured by the investments which earn  on average  approximately a annual return 
rather than liquidate some of these investments to meet short term working capital requirements  during fiscal years  and  the company borrowed million  million and million  respectively against the line of credit at fixed and variable interest rates between and 
the company must annually repay any borrowings under the line of credit on their anniversary date but may also obtain new funding up to the credit limit 
in addition  the company s european subsidiaries have available approximately million in bank credit lines to meet short term cash flow requirements 
the rate of interest on these borrowings is based on the one month euro interbank offered rate euribor 
during fiscal year  the company repaid all outstanding debt balances such that  as of april   no amounts were outstanding under any lines of credit 
during the year ended april   the company used cash in financing activities in the net amount of million 
as in prior years  the principal use of cash was payment of the semi annual dividend of million 
as indicated above  during the fiscal year the company borrowed and repaid million under its line of credit while  was received upon the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities in fiscal year was million 
the primary causes for this decline was payment of the company s semi annual cash dividend of million and payment of million against lines of credit offset by additional borrowings of million 
see preceding paragraph and note to the financial statements 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year was million 
the principal source of funds was short term financing from financial institutions in the amount of million 
cash was used to pay the company s semi annual cash dividend of million and  was used to make regularly scheduled long term liability payments 
these outflows were partially offset by the receipt of  for repayment of a stock loan and the exercise of stock options 
the company will continue to use treasury shares to satisfy the future exercise of stock options granted to officers and employees 
the company has been authorized by its board of directors to repurchase up to million worth of shares of its common stock for treasury whenever appropriate opportunities arise but it has neither a formal repurchase plan nor commitments to purchase additional shares in the future 
the company will continue to expend resources to develop and improve products for space applications  guidance and targeting systems  wireless networks and wireline communication systems which management believes will result in future growth and continued profitability 
during fiscal year  the company intends to make a substantial investment of capital and technical resources to develop new products to meet the needs of the us government  commercial space and commercial communications marketplaces and to invest in more efficient product designs and manufacturing procedures 
where possible  the company will secure partial customer funding for such development efforts but is targeting to spend its own funds at a rate of approximately of revenues to achieve its development goals 
internally generated cash will be adequate to fund these development efforts 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
contractual obligations as of april  total less than more than contractual obligations in thousands year to years to years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations  deferred compensation   total     deferred compensation liability see note in the accompanying financial statements reflects payments due to current retirees receiving benefits

as of april   the company s consolidated backlog amounted to approximately million see item 
approximately of this backlog is expected to be filled during the company s fiscal year ending april  the company s liquidity is adequate to meet its foreseeable operating and investment needs 
in addition  with its available cash and marketable securities  the company is able to continue paying semi annual dividends  subject to the review and approval of its board of directors 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued statement no 
inventory costs 
fas this statement amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing and removes the so abnormal criterion that under certain circumstances could have led to the capitalization of these items 
fas requires that idle facility expense  excess spoilage  double freight and re handling costs be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
fas also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead expenses to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after june   ie  fiscal year for the company 
the adoption of fas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  stock based payment fas r 
fas r supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in fas r is similar to the approach described in fas fas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
fas r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed 
prior to fas r  only certain pro forma disclosures of fair value were required 
the provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years beginning after june   ie  fiscal year for the company 
the adoption of fas r will have an impact on the company s financial position and results of operations similar to the pro forma disclosure in the equity based compensation disclosure in note to the accompanying financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
fas this statement requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principle were recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
the company will comply with the provisions of fas although the impact of such adoption is not determinable at this time 
other matters the financial information reported herein is not necessarily indicative of future operating results or of the future financial condition of the company 
except as noted  management is unaware of any impending transactions or events that are likely to have a material adverse effect on results from operations 
inflation during fiscal  as in the two prior fiscal years  the impact of inflation on the company s business has not been materially significant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and market values of securities 
the company s investments in fixed income and equity securities were million and  respectively  at april  the investments are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  recorded as adjustments to stockholders equity 
the fair value of investments in marketable securities is generally based on quoted market prices 
typically  the fair market value of investments in fixed interest rate debt securities will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at april   a change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed income securities or results of operations investment income 
foreign currency risk with its investment in gillam fei and fei asia  the company is subject to foreign currency translation risk 
for each of these investments  the company does not have any near term intentions to repatriate its invested cash 
for this reason  the company does not intend to initiate any exchange rate hedging strategies which could be used to mitigate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations 
the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations will be recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet as a component of other comprehensive income 
as of april   the amount related to foreign currency exchange rates is a  unrealized gain 
the results of operations of foreign subsidiaries  when translated into us dollars  will reflect the average rates of exchange for the periods presented 
as a result  similar results in local currency can vary significantly upon translation into us dollars if exchange rates fluctuate significantly from one period to the next
