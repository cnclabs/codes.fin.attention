critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results reported for future periods may be affected by changes in those estimates  and revisions to estimates are included in our results for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the critical accounting policies described below affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item  part ii of this report  which we incorporate herein by reference 
revenue recognition 
we adhere to the revised guidelines and principles of sales recognition described in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  issued by the staff of the sec as a revision to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
while the wording of sab has revised the original sab  revenue recognition  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab under sab  sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss are passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
under these guidelines  the majority of our sales  including revenue from product sales and gross outbound shipping and handling charges  are recognized upon receipt of the product by the customer 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  we perform an analysis to estimate the number of days products we have shipped are in transit to our customers using data from our third party carriers and other factors 
we record an adjustment to reverse the impact of sale transaction based on the estimated value of products that have shipped  but have not yet been received by our customers  and we adjust such amounts in the subsequent period when delivery has occurred 
changes in delivery patterns or unforeseen shipping delays beyond our control could have a material impact on our revenue recognition for the current period 
for all product sales shipped directly from suppliers to customers  we take title to the products sold upon shipment  bear credit risk  and bear inventory risk for returned products that are not successfully returned to suppliers  therefore  these revenues are recognized at gross sales amounts 

table of contents certain software products and extended warranties that we sell for which we are not the primary obligor are recognized on a net basis in accordance with sab and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
accordingly  such revenues are recognized in net sales either at the time of sale or over the contract period  based on the nature of the contract  at the net amount retained by us  with no cost of goods sold 
sales are reported net of estimated returns and allowances  discounts  mail in rebate redemptions and credit card chargebacks 
if actual sales returns  allowances  discounts  mail in rebate redemptions or credit card chargebacks are greater than estimated by management  additional expense may be incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based upon estimates of future collection 
we extend credit to our customers based upon an evaluation of each customer s financial condition and credit history  and generally do not require collateral 
we regularly evaluate our customers financial condition and credit history in determining the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also maintain an allowance for uncollectible vendor receivables  which arise from vendor rebate programs  price protections and other promotions 
we determine the sufficiency of the vendor receivable allowance based upon various factors  including payment history 
amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded because of potential non compliance with certain elements of vendor programs 
if the estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts or vendor receivables subsequently proves to be insufficient  additional allowance may be required 
reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we maintain an allowance for the valuation of our inventory by estimating obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on the difference between inventory cost and market value  which is determined by general market conditions  nature  age and type of each product and assumptions about future demand 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our inventory reserve 
if our inventory reserve subsequently proves to be insufficient  additional allowance may be required 
mail in rebate redemption rate estimates 
we accrue monthly expense related to promotional mail in rebates based upon the quantity of eligible orders transacted during the period and the estimated redemption rate 
the estimated expense is accrued and presented as a reduction of net sales 
the estimated redemption rates used to calculate the accrued mail in rebate expense and related mail in rebate liability are based upon historical redemption experience rates for similar products or mail in rebate amounts 
estimated redemption rates and the related mail in rebate expense and liability are regularly adjusted as actual mail in rebate redemptions for the program are processed 
if actual redemption rates are greater than anticipated  additional expense may be incurred 
advertising costs and vendor consideration 
we account for advertising costs in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 reporting on advertising costs 
we produce and circulate direct response catalogs at various dates throughout the year 
the costs of developing  producing and circulating each direct response catalog are deferred and amortized to advertising expense based on the life of the catalog  which is approximately eight weeks 
other non catalog advertising expenditures are expensed in the period incurred 
advertising expenditures are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
deferred advertising costs are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
as we circulate catalogs throughout the year  we receive market development funds and other vendor consideration from vendors included in each catalog 
these funds are deferred and recognized based on sales generated over the life of the catalog 
we also receive other non catalog related vendor consideration from our vendors in the form of cooperative marketing allowances  volume incentive rebate programs and other programs to support our marketing of their products 
most of our vendor consideration is recorded as an offset to cost of sales in accordance with eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf since such funds are not a reimbursement of specific  
table of contents incremental  identifiable costs incurred by us in selling the vendors products 
we adopted eitf on january   which requires  under certain circumstances  that vendor considerations received be recorded as a reduction of cost of sales rather than as an offset to selling  general and administrative expenses 
this resulted in a significant change in our reported net advertising expense and cost of goods sold for  the year of adopting eitf compared to prior years 
the adoption of eitf in resulted in approximately million of vendor consideration being recorded against cost of sales  which was previously recorded as an offset to selling  general and administrative expenses in prior years 
deferred vendor consideration is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
results of operations consolidated statements of operations data the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  our consolidated statements of operations in thousands and information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales

total net sales in increased by million  or  compared to total net sales in this increase was attributable to the increase in core business net sales of million and the increase in onsale

core business net sales in increased by million  or  compared to  due primarily to growth in our commercial net sales of million  or  to million compared to  resulting from improved productivity of our commercial account executives 
also contributing to the increase in core business net sales was the million in net sales to ecost 
com under a product sales agreement entered into in april and a consignment and product sales agreement entered into in may these sales were generally made to ecost 
com at our cost 
the consignment and product sales agreement terminated in august and the product sales agreement terminated in september we do not expect to make significant product sales to ecost 
com in the future 
these increases within core business net sales were partially offset by a decrease in public sector net sales of million  or  to million which resulted primarily from competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace predominantly in the second half of and our decision not to pursue certain unprofitable transactions in such a competitive environment 
further  consumer net sales declined million  or  to million resulting primarily from a decrease in advertising expenditures supporting the consumer market 
during the second half of  we reduced our advertising expenditures and attempted to optimize the return on such expenditures 
we are uncertain if these year over year decreases in advertising levels will continue  and we expect to periodically adjust such advertising expenditures in the future 
however  should we continue to spend at these lower levels for advertising  our consumer sales could be adversely affected 
onsale 
com net sales in were million compared with million in primarily due to our increased marketing efforts to promote the onsale 
com brand to the online marketplace beginning in late third quarter of onsale 
com s net sales in were insignificant as it was in its first year of operations  and therefore we believe it provides no meaningful comparison to total sales of products manufactured by each of hp and apple represented of total net sales in compared to and of total net sales in

com at cost under certain spin off transition agreements  a basis point decline in gross profit margin related to our competitive pricing strategy  and a basis point gross profit margin decline due to our shift in customer mix towards lower margin commercial customers

in  our efforts to focus on commercial and public sector sales could result in an increase in our accounts receivable as these customers are generally provided longer payment terms than consumers  in addition  we expect to continue to focus our efforts on increasing the productivity of our sales force and reducing our infrastructure costs  as well as ramping up our offshore operations  in an effort to reduce our costs 
in the future  if we need additional funds  such as for acquisitions or expansion  to fund a significant downturn in our sales or an increase in our operating expenses  or to take advantage of opportunities or favorable market conditions  we may seek additional financing from public or private debt or equity financings  however  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available at acceptable terms  if at all

impact of recently issued accounting standards in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires an entity to recognize a liability  when incurred  for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective no later than the end of the fiscal year ending after december  we have adopted fin as of the end of our fiscal year ended december  the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
the statement requires companies to assess the most appropriate model to calculate the value of the options 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to value options and we are currently assessing which model will be used in the future under the new statement and may deem an alternative model to be the most appropriate 
the use of a different model to value options may result in a different fair value than the use of the black scholes option pricing model 
in addition  there are a number of other requirements under the new standard that will result in differing accounting treatment than currently required 
these differences include  but are not limited to  the accounting for the tax benefit on employee stock options 
in addition to the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  we will also be required to determine the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the allowed transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive options  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the sec extended the implementation date of sfas r such that the effective date of the new standard for our financial statements is the first fiscal quarter of we have determined that we will adopt the modified prospective method provided by sfas r 
however  we have not yet determined the impact of adopting sfas r on our consolidated results of operations or financial position
