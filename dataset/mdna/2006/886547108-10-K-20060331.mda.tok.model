management believes that the comparable store sales decline was stemmed due to new product introductions  initiatives in sales training and improvements in the economic environment 
net earnings decreased  or million  to million 
prior year net earnings were not representative because they benefited from a million gain  net of tax  from the company s sale of its equity investment in aber diamond corporation aber

the company reports information in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
internally  management monitors the sales performance of its international stores and boutiques on a non gaap basis that eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into us dollars constant exchange rate basis 
management uses this constant exchange rate measure because it believes it is a more representative assessment of the sales performance of its international stores and boutiques and provides better comparability between reporting periods

provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was in  compared with in and in the decrease in both years was primarily due to benefits associated with the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of ajca 
the rate also benefited from the favorable state tax treatment on the gain from the company s sale of its equity investment in aber  partly offset by a favorable reserve adjustment in related to the elimination of certain tax exposures 
the ajca  which was signed into law on october   created a temporary incentive for us companies to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings by providing an dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
this incentive effectively reduces the amount of us federal income tax due on repatriation 
taking advantage of the ajca  the company recorded an income tax benefit of  in to reflect the company s plan to repatriate  of accumulated foreign earnings 
in  the company recorded an income tax benefit of  due to the internal revenue service clarifying certain provisions of the ajca in may  which also resulted in the company s decision to repatriate additional foreign earnings 
the tax benefit to the company occurred because the company had previously accrued income taxes on un repatriated foreign earnings at higher income tax rates 
in total  the company repatriated  of accumulated foreign earnings 
the ajca provides a two year transition from the existing extraterritorial income exclusion act of the world trade organization wto ruled that this exclusion was an illegal export subsidy 
the european union believes that the ajca fails to adequately repeal illegal export subsidies because of these transitional provisions and has asked the wto to review whether these transitional provisions are in compliance with the wto s prior ruling 
until the final resolution of this matter  management will be unable to predict what impact  if any  this will have on future earnings

management expects such seasonality to continue 
critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
periodically  the company reviews all significant estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements and records the effect of any necessary adjustments 
the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related disclosures below have been reviewed with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the following critical accounting policies that rely on assumptions and estimates were used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements inventory 
the company writes down its inventory for discontinued and slow moving products 
this write down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated market value  and is based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs might be required 
at january   a change in the reserve for discontinued and slow moving products would have resulted in a change of  in inventory and cost of sales 
the company s domestic and foreign branch inventories  excluding japan  are valued using the last in  first out lifo method  and inventories held by foreign subsidiaries and japan are valued using the average cost method 
fluctuation in inventory levels  along with the costs of raw materials  could affect the carrying value of the company s inventory 
long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets are primarily property  plant and equipment 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment when management determines that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable due to events or changes in circumstances 
recoverability of long lived assets is evaluated by comparing the carrying value of the asset with estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
if the comparisons indicate that the value of the asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset and the loss is recognized during that period 
the company recorded impairment charges of  in and did not record any impairment charges in and goodwill 
the company performs its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed 
the evaluation  based upon discounted cash flows  requires management to estimate future cash flows  growth rates and economic and market conditions 
the evaluation did not result in any impairment charges  however  it is possible that impairment charges could be recorded in the future if results vary from those anticipated 
impairment charges recorded in amounted to  and no such charges were recorded in tiffany co 
k income taxes 
foreign and domestic tax authorities periodically audit the company s income tax returns 
these audits often examine and test the factual and legal basis for positions the company has taken in its tax filings with respect to its tax liabilities  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions tax filing positions 
management believes that its tax filing positions are reasonable and legally supportable 
however  in specific cases  various tax authorities may take a contrary position and insist upon an adjustment 
in evaluating the exposures associated with the company s various tax filing positions  management records reserves for probable exposures 
earnings could be affected to the extent the company prevails in matters for which reserves have been established or is required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
the company also records valuation allowances when management determines it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
employee benefit plans 
the company maintains several pension and retirement plans  as well as provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for current and retired employees 
the company makes certain assumptions that affect the underlying estimates related to pension and other postretirement costs 
significant changes in interest rates  the market value of securities and projected health care costs would require the company to revise key assumptions and could result in a higher or lower charge to earnings 
the company used a discount rate of to determine its pension and postretirement expense 
holding all other assumptions constant  a increase in the discount rate would have decreased pension and postretirement expenses by  and  a decrease of in the discount rate would have increased the pension and postretirement expenses by  and  the discount rate is subject to change each year  consistent with changes in the yield on applicable high quality  long term corporate bonds 
management selects a discount rate at which pension and postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based on i analysis of expected benefit payments attributable to current employment service and ii appropriate yields related to such cash flows 
the company used an expected long term rate of return of to determine its pension expense 
holding all other assumptions constant  a change in the long term rate of return would have changed the pension expense by  the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account the average rate of return expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
more specifically  consideration is given to the expected rates of return including reinvestment asset return rates based upon the plan s current asset mix  investment strategy and the historical performance of plan assets 
for postretirement benefit measurement purposes  the following annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care were assumed for for pre age retirees and for post age retirees 
the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to by for pre age retirees and by for post age retirees and remain at that level thereafter 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased the aggregate service and interest cost components of the postretirement expense by  decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would have decreased the aggregate service and interest cost components of the postretirement expense by  equity compensation plans 
the company has equity compensation plans for employees and directors 
until january  the company granted only stock options 
in january  the company  in addition to stock options  granted performance based restricted stock units to executive officers of the company and time vesting restricted stock units to other management employees 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  the company early adopted sfas no 
r that requires new  modified and unvested share based payment transactions with employees  such as stock options and restricted stock  tiffany co 
k be measured at fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period see note b to consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of each option award is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model that requires the company to develop estimates for assumptions used in the model 
the black scholes valuation model uses the following assumptions expected volatility  expected term of the option  risk free interest rate and dividend yield
