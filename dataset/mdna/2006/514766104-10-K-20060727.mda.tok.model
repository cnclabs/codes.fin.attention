except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described in item a 
risk factors 
landec undertakes no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been engaged in the research and development of its intelimer technology and related products 
the company has launched four product lines from this core development quickcast tm splints and casts  in april  which was subsequently sold to bissell healthcare corporation in august  intelimer packaging technology for the fresh cut and whole produce 
table of contents packaging market  in september  intelimer polymer systems in june that includes polymer materials for various industrial applications and beginning in november for personal care applications  and intellicoat coated corn seeds in the fall of with the acquisition of apio in december and landec ag in september  the company is focused on two core businesses food products technology and agricultural seed technology 
the food products technology segment combines the company s intelimer packaging technology with apio s fresh cut and whole produce business 
the agricultural seed technology segment integrates the intellicoat seed coating technology with landec ag s direct marketing  telephone sales and distribution capabilities 
the company also operates a technology licensing research and development business which develops products to be licensed outside of the company s core businesses 
see business description of core business 
from inception through may   the company s accumulated deficit was million 
the company may incur additional losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is highly uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in future years 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
notes and advances receivables apio has made advances to fruit growers for the development of orchards  and to produce growers for crop and harvesting costs 
typically  except for development advances  these advances are paid off within the growing season less than one year from harvested crops 
development advances and advances not fully paid during the current growing season are converted to interest bearing obligations  evidenced by contracts and notes receivable 
these notes receivable and advances are secured by liens on land and or crops and have terms that range from twelve to sixty months 
notes receivable are periodically reviewed at least quarterly for collectibility 
a reserve is established for any note or advance deemed to not be fully collectible based upon an estimate of the crop value or the fair value of the security for the note or advance 
if crop prices or the fair value of the underlying security declines the company may be unable to fully recoup its note or advance receivable and the estimated losses would rise in the current period  potentially to the extent of the total note or advance receivable 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
bad debt losses are partially mitigated due to low risks related to the fact that the company s customers are predominantly large financially sound national and regional retailers 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 

table of contents these provisions are determined based on specific identification for unusable inventory and an additional reserve  based on historical losses  for inventory considered to be useable 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  and discounts 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience  additional allowances may be required 
licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition a replacement of sab  sab 
initial license fees are deferred and amortized over the period of the agreement to revenue when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the research and development period of the agreement  as well as the term of any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
prior to november   the company recognized noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees as revenue when received and when all significant contractual obligations of the company relating to the fees had been met 
effective november   the company changed its method of accounting for noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees to recognize such fees over the research and development period of the agreement  as well as the term of any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
the company believes the change in accounting principle is preferable based on guidance provided in sab in the fiscal year ended october   the company recorded a charge of million related to the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect was initially recorded as deferred revenue and has been recognized as recycled revenue over the research and development period or supply period commitment of the agreement 
recycled revenue refers to revenue that had previously been recognized as licensing revenue in the company s financial statements  but as a result of the company s adoption of sab  was reversed through a cumulative effect of a change in accounting in fiscal year and has been recognized as revenue over the research and development period and or the supply period commitment of the agreement  whichever is longer 
in july  the company amended its supply agreement with alcon  inc alcon to change the expiration date of the agreement from november  to may  in accordance with sab  the entire amount of the deferred revenue of  as of may   was recognized as recycled revenue during fiscal year during the fiscal years ended may   may  and may     and  respectively  of the related deferred revenue was recognized as recycled revenue 
as of may   deferred revenue associated with the change in accounting principles described above is zero 
contract revenue for research and development r d is recorded as earned  based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and there is no continuing involvement by the company  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
goodwill and other intangible asset impairment the company is required to evaluate its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually 
this evaluation incorporates a variety of estimates including the fair value of the company s operating segments 
if the carrying value of an operating segment s assets exceeds the estimated fair value  the company would likely be required to record an impairment loss  possibly for the entire carrying balance of goodwill and intangible assets 
to date  no impairment losses have been incurred 

table of contents income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing the valuation allowance and  if necessary  adjusts the amount of such allowance 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
due to the company s limited tax basis earnings history  the net deferred tax asset at may  has been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting for stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 and supersedes apb opinion sfas r requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
on april   the sec adopted a new rule that amended the compliance dates for sfas r such that the company is now allowed to adopt the new standard effective in the first quarter of fiscal year the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using apb opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
under sfas r  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include modified prospective and retroactive adoption options 
under the retroactive option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the modified prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r  while the retroactive method would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
the company has decided to adopt the modified prospective method 
the company is currently evaluating the requirements of sfas r as well as option valuation methodologies related to its stock option plans 
the company s preliminary estimate indicates that the effect of adopting sfas r could result in a pre tax charge to net income of up to approximately  in fiscal year sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption
