overview we are a leading retailer of textbooks  educational materials and school uniforms targeting the private middle and high school  college  distance  and continuing education markets 
under the varsitybooks and campus outfitters brands  we offer a comprehensive outsource solution to provide textbooks  uniforms and school supplies to private k schools  colleges  and distance and continuing education markets 
through our textbook and uniform outsource solutions  schools are released from the operational and financial challenges associated with managing highly seasonal retail operations and are free to focus on their core educational mission 
parents and students benefit from the increased convenience and value associated with our comprehensive textbook and uniform programs 
we were incorporated in december and began offering books for sale on our website on august  prior to  our revenues consisted primarily of sales of new textbooks 
in may  we acquired campus outfitters  a leading retailer of school uniforms to the private k school marketplace  and introduced school uniforms as a second revenue stream into our business 
to date  the primary channel for textbook sales has been through online ecommerce transactions  while the majority of uniform sales have been recognized through retail stores and on campus sales events 
our original sales model focused on building a broad consumer brand offering promotions and deeply discounted textbook prices to entice college students to visit our website and purchase their textbooks from us 
however  during we began to focus resources on the growth and development of our edupartners program  whereby we became a provider of new textbooks and learning materials to private middle and high school  college  distance  and continuing education markets 
this model represents the overwhelming majority of our textbook business today 
fiscal marked a significant milestone for us as we recorded the first profitable fiscal year in our company 
this was accomplished through a combination of revenue growth  margin enhancement and cost reduction efforts initiated during as part of this transformation we successfully lowered our overall expense structure and improved the margins of our retail book business while growing edupartners revenues 
in may  as part of our strategy to expand the number of services and products we offer our customers  we acquired campus outfitters 
through the campus outfitters brand  varsity group owns and operates nine retail locations serving private k school communities as their official school uniform provider 
parents and students are also able to purchase uniforms and related items via on campus sales events which are held at eligible schools as well as online through customized virtual stores which are created on www 
campusoutfitters 
com for each partner school containing all required uniform components 
we believe with the campus outfitters acquisition  we now have the opportunity to begin cross selling our textbook and uniform model between our combined network of existing customers 
during  in part due to organic growth through our edupartners program and in part due to the acquisition of campus outfitters  overall revenues grew by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal fiscal also represented our fourth consecutive profitable fiscal year 
we expect textbooks and uniforms apparel to remain our primary sources of revenue in however  we will continue to explore opportunities to expand the scope of products and services we provide our partner schools and will aggressively pursue opportunities which we believe will enable us to introduce new  profitable revenue streams 
our ability to sustain annual operating profitability depends on our ability to maintain and grow net revenues while containing expenses 
we base our current and future expense levels on our operating plans and estimates of future revenues 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we have limited experience forecasting our revenues 
therefore we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results might not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
seasonality we experience significant seasonality in our results of operations 
consistent with our focus on the expansion of edupartners and introduction of campus outfitters uniform model and their current concentration of private middle and high school institutions  since the year ended december   our peak selling period is the july august september back to school season 
during fiscal and  approximately and of our revenues  respectively  were recognized in this period 
we expect this trend to continue as we expand our textbook and uniform programs in the private middle and high school market during while many private middle and high school institutions have an active book buying season in december january  the volume of purchases are typically significantly lower than the initial back to school season 
historically  campus outfitters has experienced the same seasonality in its results of operations 
consistent with its current concentration of private elementary  middle and high schools  campus outfitters peak selling season has been july august september back to school season 
part of our strategy is to extend our textbook program more deeply into the college and distance learning markets  expand our uniform model to more broadly incorporate branded apparel and identify profitable new products or services to market to our existing customer base 
this could result in more balanced revenues throughout the year 
however  based upon our current program  product and school mix  we will continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for a comprehensive discussion of our accounting policies  see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we do not have any ownership interest in any special purpose or similar entities and do not have any significant related party transactions except for those associated with our relationship with b t prior to july see note to the consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to guidance published by the sec regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from textbook and uniform sales  net of any discounts and coupons  when our customers receive the products 
we take title to new textbooks sold online via our edupartners program upon transfer to the shipper and assume the risks and rewards of ownership including the risk of loss for collection 
we take title to our uniform and textbook inventory held at our retail locations at the time of purchase from the supplier  publisher or buyback customer and we place them in inventory as available for sale at that time 
we do not function as an agent or broker for our supplier see note to the consolidated financial statements 
outbound shipping charges are included in net sales 
we provide allowances for sales returns  promotional discounts and coupons based on historical experience in the period of the sale 
through may  our revenues have consisted primarily of sales of textbooks 
after our acquisition of campus outfitters in may  our revenues have consisted of sales of textbooks and uniforms 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  management reviews both positive and negative evidence pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 including current and historical results of operations  the annual limitation on utilization of net operating loss carryforwards pursuant to internal revenue code section  future income projections and the overall prospects of our business 
based upon management s assessment of all available evidence  including our cumulative net income for fiscal  and  estimates of future profitability and the overall prospects of our business  we concluded that it is more likely than not that the recorded portion of the deferred tax benefits will be realized 
we will continue to monitor all available evidence and reassess the potential realization of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis  coinciding with our fiscal year end  or on an interim basis if circumstances change 
if we continue to meet our financial projections and improve upon our results of operations  it is reasonably possible that we may release all  or a portion  of the remaining valuation allowance in the future 
such releases  if any  would result in recording a tax benefit that would increase net income in the period the allowance is released and  thereafter  if relating to certain option deductions  increase additional paid in capital 
at december   approximately million of potential future income tax benefit was fully reserved on our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation plans through december   we accounted for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board abp opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations using the intrinsic value based method of accounting see recent accounting standards 
we estimate that if we used the fair value method outlined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  our reported amounts of net income would have been reduced by approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
our reported amounts of net income per diluted share would have been reduced by approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the determination of the fair value of our equity options includes significant estimates  such as volatility and expected terms 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of inventories inventories  consisting of textbooks and uniforms available for sale  are valued at the lower of cost or market value and are accounted for principally using the fifo method 
our inventory balance as of december  consists mainly of used textbooks that we purchased during fiscal  new textbooks that we are able to procure from publishers at better terms than those available to b t  and uniforms or apparel  and new and used textbooks located at our retail locations 
historically  approximately of the unsold new textbook inventory held by b t in support of our edupartners program has been returned for full credit with publishers  which substantially reduces our risk of inventory obsolescence 
we take title to the remaining unsold inventory and write down this balance  as well as any remaining used book inventory  for estimated excess and obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions on a quarterly basis 
in connection with our acquisition of campus outfitters  we acquired approximately million in apparel inventory 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas  we valued the acquired inventory based on estimated selling prices less the sum of a reasonable profit allowance for our selling effort and costs of disposal 
business acquisition and valuation and impairment review of long lived assets we accounted for our purchase of campus outfitters in accordance sfas and accounted for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  we allocated the cost of campus outfitters to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
management s estimates of the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired was based on discounted cash flow techniques that included significant estimates about future performance 
as required by sfas  in lieu of amortizing goodwill  we will test goodwill for impairment annually and any time a triggering indicator exists 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets and the annual impairment tests required by sfas requires management to make estimates of future revenues  customer retention rates  estimated useful lives and other assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including software developed for internal use  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
when we determine that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  we generally measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in addition  at each reporting date  we compare the net realizable value of capitalized software development costs to the unamortized capitalized costs 
to the extent the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the net realizable value  the excess amount is written off 
in accordance with sfas  we recorded a write off of approximately  during the fiscal year ended december  related to the discontinued use of our buyback program software  which has been replaced with another tool 
evaluating long lived assets for impairment involves judgments as to when an asset may potentially be impaired 
we consider there to be a risk of impairment if there is a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or if there is a significant change in the extent or intended use of an asset 
results of operations fiscal years ended december  net sales textbooks uniforms shipping total net sales operating expenses cost of textbooks cost of uniforms cost of shipping sales and marketing tax related benefit general and administrative amortization of acquired intangibles non cash compensation total operating expenses income from operations other income  net income before income taxes income tax benefit net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased  or million  to million for year ended december  uniform revenue introduced with our acquisition of campus outfitters in may represented approximately million of this increase 
the remaining increase of million was due to the growth of textbook and related revenues attributable to the increase in the number of schools we serviced during compared to the prior year period 
net sales consist of sales of textbooks and uniforms and charges to customers for outbound shipping and are net of allowances for returns  promotional discounts and coupons 
revenues from sales are recognized at the time products are received by the customer 
in  we expect our total revenues to increase based upon the continued growth of our varsitybooks edupartners textbook and campus outfitters school uniform programs 
over time  expansion of used book revenue as a percentage of total revenues may serve to lower textbook revenue growth since used books are typically priced at a discount to comparable new textbooks 
however  the related decrease in revenue growth is typically offset by higher gross margins associated with the sale of used books

any future acquisition or investment may result in a dilution to existing shareholders to the extent we issue shares of our common stock as consideration or reduced liquidity and capital resources to the extent we use cash as consideration 
we believe that our existing liquidity and expected cash flows from operations will satisfy the capital requirements of our current business for the foreseeable future 
we believe that the combination of cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund expected capital expenditures  capital lease obligations and working capital needs associated with our current business model for at least the next twelve months

recent accounting standards in november of  fasb issued statement no  inventory costs  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter sfas 
the amendments made by sfas clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during the fiscal year beginning january  we do not believe that the adoption of the new standard will have a material impact on our financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
and supercedes apb opinion no 
and requires all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of employee and director stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
we are required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of through december   we accounted for share based payments to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method 
under this method  we generally did not recognize any compensation related to stock option grants we issued under our equity compensation plans 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
beginning in our first quarter  sfas r requires us to recognize share based compensation as compensation expense in the statement of operations based on the fair values of such equity on the date of the grant  with the compensation expense recognized over the period in which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the equity award 
this statement also requires us to adopt a fair value based method for measuring the compensation expense related to share based compensation 
we plan to use the modified prospective method of recognition of compensation expense related to share based payments  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock from the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r 
the impact of adoption of sfas r is difficult to predict at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  management currently estimates that  based on our unvested stock option awards outstanding as of december   the remaining compensation cost related to previous grants that will be recognized in the financial statements pursuant to the modified prospective method in future years will be approximately million 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
under sfas  entities will be required to report a change in accounting principle through retrospective application of the new accounting principle to all prior periods  unless impracticable to do so 
in addition  errors in the financial statements of a prior period discovered subsequent to their issuance shall be reported as a prior period adjustment by restating the prior period financial statements 
this standard will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made  if any  in fiscal years beginning after december  management does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our financial position in in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fasb statement no 
r fsp r 
fsp r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards when the award has been granted 
one of the criteria for determining that an award has been granted is that the employer and its employees have a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the award 
under fsp r  a mutual understanding is assumed to exist on the date the award is approved by the board of directors and the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to the individual within a relatively short time period from the date of approval 
we are required to adopt fsp r in the first quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
interest rate risk 
our cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments are subject to interest rate risk 
we manage this risk by maintaining a diversified investment portfolio of instruments with high credit quality and varying maturity dates 
these instruments are designated as available for sale and  accordingly  are presented at fair value on our balance sheets and include  but are not limited to  commercial paper  money market instruments  bank time deposits and variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations and national  state and local governments and agencies 
these instruments are denominated in us dollars 
the fair market value of cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments held was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
we also hold cash balances in accounts with commercial banks in the united states 
these cash balances represent operating balances only and are invested in short term deposits of the local bank 
the weighted average yield on interest bearing investments held as of december  was approximately per annum 
based on our investment holdings at december   a basis point decline in the average yield would have reduced our annual interest income by million
