critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventory the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
sales returns and allowances the company s ability to collect factor chargebacks for deductions taken by its customers for returns  discounts  and allowances as well as potential future customer deductions is significant to its operations 
the company reserves against known chargebacks as well as potential future customer deductions based on a combination of historical activity and current market conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which may have a significant impact on the company s results 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments  as well as royalties and advertising revenues from its licensing partners 
these customers include non factored accounts and credit card receivables from third party service providers 
if the financial conditions of these customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes the company s income taxes are routinely under audit by federal  state  or local authorities 
these audits include questioning of the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
based on its annual evaluations of tax positions  the company believes it has appropriately accrued for probable exposures 
to the extent the company is required to pay amounts in excess of recorded income tax liabilities  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially impacted 
litigation the company is periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgements as well as the potential range of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each significant legal action 
the company s accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the company is involved in and subject to compliance and regulatory reviews and audits by numerous authorities  agencies and other governmental agents and entities from various jurisdictions 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes of these matters 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these reviews is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or final resolution in each matter  which may have a significant impact on the company s results

consolidated gross profit remained at  as a percentage of net revenues  in and this was primarily a result of an increase in the percentage of revenue and higher margins contributed by the consumer direct segment  offset by decreased margins within the wholesale segment 
the consumer direct segment increased as a percentage of net revenues  to  for the year ended december   from for the year ended december   while the wholesale segment  which operates at a lower gross profit percentage  decreased as a percentage of net revenues to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  consumer direct segment margins increased from merchandising initiatives at its outlet stores  new assortments  which focus on wear now products that limit vulnerability of the mix of products without compromising fashion and excitement  and a reduction of point of sale promotions

the company currently has a line of credit  as amended  under which up to million is available to finance working capital requirements and letters of credit to finance the company s inventory purchases 
borrowings available under the line of credit are determined by a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventories and bear interest at i the higher of the bank of new york s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus at the date of borrowing or ii a negotiated rate

exchange rates the company routinely enters into forward exchange contracts for its future purchases of inventory denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
at december   forward exchange contracts with a notional value totaling million were outstanding with settlement dates ranging from january through may gains and losses on forward exchange contracts that are used for hedges are accounted for on the balance sheet as inventory and an adjustment to equity  and are subsequently accounted for as part of the purchase price of the inventory upon execution of the contract 
at december   the unrealized loss on these outstanding forward contracts is approximately  net of taxes  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in shareholders equity and a decrease to inventory  which is the underlying exposure on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company expects to continue to routinely enter into additional foreign exchange contracts throughout the year 
while the company believes that its current procedures with respect to the reduction of risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations are adequate  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company in the future 
inventory from contract manufacturers in the far east and brazil are purchased in united states dollars and the recent fluctuations of many of these currencies against the united states dollar has not had any material adverse impact on the company 
however  future purchase prices for the company s products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturer  which may affect the company s cost of goods in the future 
the company does not believe the potential effects of such fluctuations would have a material adverse effect on the company 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively low rates of inflation experienced over the last few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not believe it has a material exposure to market risk 
the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risks with respect to its inventory transactions denominated in euro 
business activities in various currencies expose the company to the risk that the eventual net dollar cash flows from transactions with foreign suppliers denominated in foreign currencies may be adversely affected by changes in currency rates 
the company manages these risks by utilizing foreign exchange contracts 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
at december   the company had forward exchange contracts totaling with notional values million  which resulted in an unrealized loss of approximately  net of taxes 
the company s earnings may also be affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under its line of credit facility 
a two or less percentage point increase in interest rates affecting the company s credit facility would not have had a material effect on the company s and net income
