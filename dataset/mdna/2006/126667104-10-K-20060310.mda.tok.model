overview cv therapeutics  inc  headquartered in palo alto  california  is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of new small molecule drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases 
we apply advances in molecular biology and genetics to identify mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases and targets for drug discovery 
we currently have two approved cardiovascular products to promote with our national cardiovascular specialty sales force ranexa ranolazine extended release tablets and aceon perindopril erbumine tablets 
ranexa was approved in the united states in january for the treatment of chronic angina in patients who have not achieved an adequate response with other antianginal drugs 
ranexa represents the first new pharmaceutical approach to treat angina in the united states in more than years 
we plan to launch ranexa in the united states in march aceon  an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor  or ace inhibitor  is approved in the united states for use in patients with stable coronary artery disease to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction  or mi  and for the treatment of patients with essential hypertension 
we co promote aceon in the united states with our partner solvay pharmaceuticals  inc in addition to our marketed products  we are developing regadenoson  a selective a 
a 
adenosine receptor agonist for potential use as a pharmacologic agent in myocardial perfusion imaging studies 
in january  the us food and drug administration  or fda  approved ranexa for the treatment of chronic angina 
because ranexa prolongs the qt interval  the approved product labeling indicates that it is reserved for patients who have not achieved an adequate response with other antianginal drugs 
ranexa should be used in combination with amlodipine  beta blockers or nitrates 
ranexa has antianginal and anti ischemic effects that do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or blood pressure 
in order to potentially broaden the product labeling for ranexa  we are conducting the metabolic efficiency with ranolazine for less ischemia in non st elevation acute coronary syndromes  or merlin timi  clinical study 
this study is being conducted under a special protocol assessment  or spa  agreement with the fda 
if treatment with ranexa is not associated with an adverse trend in death or arrhythmia compared to placebo  the study could support potential approval of ranexa as first line chronic angina therapy  even if statistical significance on the primary endpoint is not achieved 
in addition  if statistical significance on the primary endpoint is achieved  ranexa could also gain potential approval for hospital based and long term prevention of acute coronary syndromes 
the merlin timi study began enrollment in october and is being conducted by the harvard based timi study group 
we currently expect data from the merlin timi study in the fourth quarter of or the first quarter of 
table of contents in august  the fda approved a supplemental new drug application  or snda  for aceon for the treatment of patients with stable coronary artery disease to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction 
the labeling expansion was based on the europa european trial on reduction of cardiac events with perindopril in patients with stable coronary artery disease study  which assessed the ability of perindopril to reduce cardiovascular death  nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest in a broad population of patients who had stable coronary artery disease but not heart failure or substantial hypertension 
in the europa study  perindopril significantly reduced relative cardiovascular risk by as assessed by the primary combined study endpoint of cardiovascular death  nonfatal myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest 
aceon is also indicated for the treatment of hypertension 
one of our drug candidates which is in late stage clinical development is regadenoson  a selective a 
a 
adenosine receptor agonist for potential use as a pharmacologic agent in myocardial perfusion imaging studies 
we completed a phase trial of regadenoson which met its primary endpoint  for this proposed use in august data from a second phase trial with the same design are expected in in addition  we have several development  preclinical and research programs whose objectives are to bring additional drugs to market to help patients with unmet medical needs 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates within the framework of generally accepted accounting principles  management judgments and estimates must be made and applied in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in any accounting period 
if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences could result in the amount and timing of transactions recorded in any period 
we believe the following critical accounting policies presently involve our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements valuation of marketable securities we invest in short term and long term marketable debt securities for use in current operations 
we classify our investments as available for sale and report the securities at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
for securities with unrealized losses as of the period end  we evaluate whether the impairment is other than temporary 
our assessment includes a consideration of our intent and ability to hold the impaired security for a period of time sufficient to recover its cost basis 
if we conclude that an other than temporary impairment exists  we recognize an impairment charge to reduce the investment to fair value and record the related charge as a reduction of interest and other income  net 
as a result of increases in market interest rates during  we had unrealized losses of million in our investment portfolio as of december  after consideration of the scheduled maturities in our investment portfolio  our policies with respect to the concentration of investments with issuers or within industries  and our forecasted needs to support our operations  we concluded that we did not have the ability to hold impaired securities for a period of time sufficient to recover their cost basis 
as a result  for the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million related to these securities 
if market interest rates continue to increase in future periods  we may record additional impairment charges related to our investments 
revenue recognition revenue under our collaborative research arrangement is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract 
amounts received under such arrangements consist of up front license payments  periodic milestone payments and reimbursements for research activities 
up front or milestone payments which are still subject to future performance requirements are recorded as deferred revenue and are amortized over the performance period 
the performance period is estimated at the inception of the arrangement and is reevaluated 
table of contents at each reporting period 
the reevaluation of the performance period may shorten or lengthen the period during which the deferred revenue is recognized 
we reevaluated the performance period for certain collaborative research arrangements in  which resulted in an immaterial change in revenues as compared to our original estimate 
we will continue to reevaluate the performance period for our collaborative arrangements in future periods 
we evaluate the appropriate performance period based on research progress attained and certain events  such as changes in the regulatory and competitive environment 
revenues related to substantive  at risk milestones are recognized upon achievement of the scientific or regulatory event specified in the underlying agreement 
revenues for research activities are recognized as the related research efforts are performed 
revenue under our aceon co promotion agreement is recognized based on net product sales recorded by solvay pharmaceuticals  our co promotion partner  for each reporting period 
we have not recognized any co promotion revenue to date 
research and development expenses and accruals research and development expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contract services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for clinical trials  manufacturing and process development  research and other consulting and vendor activities  costs are expensed upon the earlier of when non refundable amounts are due or as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our expense accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the ongoing development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
expense accruals for the contracts depend on estimates we make on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful accrual of patients  and the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
we determine our estimates through discussions with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to the progress made or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our consolidated financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
if we underestimate or overestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  adjustments to research and development expenses would be necessary in future periods 
to date  such adjustments have not been material 
inventory valuation prior to regulatory approval of our drug candidates  we incur expenses for the manufacture of drug product that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of these drug candidates 
until the necessary initial regulatory approval has been received or is otherwise considered assured  we charge all such amounts to research and development expenses 
as of december   all ranexa inventory costs have been expensed 
as a result  our initial sales of ranexa will result in higher gross margins than if the inventory costs had not previously been expensed 
after receiving regulatory approval for ranexa in january  we will begin to capitalize the commercial inventory costs associated with manufacturing ranexa 
stock compensation valuation the preparation of the financial statement footnotes requires us to estimate the fair value of stock based payments granted to employees and consultants 
while fair value may be readily determinable for awards of 
table of contents stock or restricted stock units  market quotes are not available for long term  non transferable stock options or stock appreciation rights because these instruments are not traded 
we currently use the black scholes and other option pricing models to estimate the fair value of employee stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan 
our estimate of compensation expense will require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility and employee exercise patterns 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
because there is a market for options on our common stock  we have considered implied volatilities as well as our historical realized volatilities when developing an estimate of expected volatility 
the expected option term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  lengthier option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
however  empirical data shows that employees  for a variety of reasons  typically do not wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
accordingly  companies are required to estimate the expected term of the option for input to an option pricing model 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term  we consider the vesting period for the award  our historical experience of employee stock option exercises  the expected volatility  and a comparison to relevant peer group data 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we are likely to change our valuation assumptions used to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
changes to the subjective input assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of our stock based payments 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and revenues total revenues and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  collaborative research revenues dollar change from prior year percentage change from prior year the decrease in collaborative research revenues in from was primarily due to decreased reimbursable development costs incurred in connection with our two phase clinical trials undertaken in our collaboration with astellas us llc for the development of regadenoson 
in august  we announced data for one of the two phase clinical trials for regadenoson which has now been completed  while the other phase trial is ongoing 
the increase in collaborative research revenues in from was primarily due to increased reimbursable development costs associated with two phase clinical trials undertaken in our collaboration with astellas us llc for the development of regadenoson 
we have not recognized any aceon co promotion revenue to date 
we expect that any future aceon co promotion revenues will depend upon the achievement of sales above a specified baseline by us and our collaborative partner  solvay pharmaceuticals 

table of contents research and development expenses total research and development expenses and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  total research and development expenses dollar change from prior year percentage change from prior year the increase in research and development expenses in from was primarily due to increased outside contract service expenses for our phase ranexa studies  and to a lesser extent  higher personnel related expenses resulting from increased headcount in our research and development organization 
these increases were partially offset by the accrual in of million for a milestone due under our license agreement with roche palo alto llc for ranexa and decreased outside contract service expenses for our phase regadenoson studies 
the increase in research and development expenses in from was primarily due to increased outside contract service expenses for our phase ranexa and regadenoson studies as well as an expense associated with an accrual of million for a milestone due under our license agreement with roche palo alto llc for ranexa 
we categorize our research and development expenses by project 
the table below shows research and development expenses for our two primary clinical development programs  ranexa and regadenoson  as well as expenses associated with all other projects in our research and development pipeline 
other projects consist primarily of numerous pre clinical research projects  none of which individually constitutes more than of our total research and development expenses for the periods presented 
year ended december  in thousands ranexa regadenoson other projects total research and development expenses we expect total research and development expenses to increase in as we continue the phase merlin timi study and other clinical and preclinical studies for ranexa  regadenoson and expand our other research and development projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  total selling  general and administrative expenses dollar change from prior year percentage change from prior year 
table of contents the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in from was primarily due to additional personnel and related expenses incurred in conjunction with establishing and maintaining a national cardiovascular specialty sales force that includes approximately cardiovascular account specialists as well as other aceon co promotion related activities and  to a significantly lesser extent  to higher personnel related general and administrative expenses due to increased headcount to support our increased commercialization and other business activities 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in from was primarily due to additional general and administrative personnel and related expenses to support our pre commercialization and research and development efforts  partially offset by decreased marketing planning and communications activities for ranexa in and a non cash expense recorded in of approximately million related to a warrant issued to quintiles transnational corp 
upon modification of our commercialization agreement 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in as we launch ranexa and continue to co promote aceon in the united states 
we established our national cardiovascular specialty sales force in the second quarter of in and future years  we will incur a full year of expenses related to our national cardiovascular specialty sales force 
interest and other income  net total interest and other income  net and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  total interest and other income  net dollar change from prior year percentage change from prior year the increase in interest and other income  net in from was primarily due to higher interest rates earned on our investment portfolio  partially offset by a non cash investment impairment charge of million related to losses on our investment portfolio that were deemed to be other than temporary 
the decrease in interest and other income  net in from was primarily due to losses recognized on sales of marketable securities in the year ended december   compared to gains recognized on sales of marketable securities in the year ended december  we expect interest and other income  net to fluctuate in the future with changes in average investment balances and market interest rates 
interest expense total interest expense and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior year are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  total interest expense dollar change from prior year percentage change from prior year the decrease in interest expense in from was primarily due to the write off in of million of previously unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the august redemption of the 
table of contents remaining outstanding million principal amount of our subordinated convertible notes due  compared to the write off in of million of previously unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the may and june repurchases of million principal amount of our subordinated convertible notes due these factors were partially offset by higher interest expense in related to higher average convertible debt balances 
the increase in interest expense in from was primarily due to the write off in of million of debt issuance costs from the repurchase of approximately million of our previously issued subordinated convertible notes due and the amortization of debt issuance costs and interest associated with the june issuance of our senior subordinated convertible debentures 
our convertible subordinated notes due accounted for million  million and million of interest expense in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our senior subordinated convertible debentures due accounted for million  million and million of interest expense in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our senior subordinated convertible notes due accounted for million and million of interest expense in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our senior subordinated convertible notes due accounted for million of interest expense in the year ended december  we expect interest expense to fluctuate in the future with average convertible debt balances 
other expense  net total other expense  net and dollar and percentage changes as compared to the prior years are as follows dollar amounts are presented in millions year ended december  total other expense  net dollar change from prior year percentage change from prior year the decrease in other expense  net in from was primarily due to the premium paid above the principal value of approximately million for the august redemption of million principal amount of our subordinated convertible notes due compared to the premium paid above the principal value of approximately million for the may and june repurchases of million principal amount of our subordinated convertible notes due the increase in other expense  net in from was due to million in premium payments above the principal value incurred from the repurchase of approximately million of our previously issued convertible subordinated notes due taxes we have not generated taxable income to date 
as of december   the net operating losses potentially available to offset future taxable income for federal and california income tax purposes were approximately million and million  respectively 
utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards will likely be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar california provisions 
the federal carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the california carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the federal research tax credits will expire at various dates beginning in the year  if not utilized 
the california research tax credit carry forwards can be carried forward indefinitely 
as a result of annual limitations  a portion of these carryforwards and research tax credits may expire before becoming available to reduce our federal and california income tax liabilities 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements we are required to adopt financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  statement r on january  generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we intend to recognize stock based compensation expense on all awards on a straight line basis over the requisite service period using the modified prospective method for all options issued after january  and we will intend to use the black scholes option pricing model to value stock based payments under statement r 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for stock based payments to employees using accounting principles board opinion no 
s intrinsic value method 
as a result  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
however  we do include expense amounts associated with grants of restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in our results of operations 
the adoption of statement r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adopting statement r will depend in part on levels of share based payments granted in the future and other unknown variables  such as estimated forfeiture rates  volatility  interest rates and option term length 
in accordance with statement r  deferred compensation and related common stock on our balance sheet as of december  which totals approximately million as of december  will be reversed and future charges for deferred compensation from our restricted stock units will be recorded to common stock directly as the related services are performed 
we are assessing the cumulative benefit of a change in accounting principle  which may result from the net cumulative impact of estimating future forfeitures for unvested restricted stock units outstanding as of january   in the determination of period expense  rather than recording forfeitures when they occur as previously permitted 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
fsp no 
fas provides additional guidance on the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of the loss 
although fsp no 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   we believe the fsp s clarification to the guidance regarding when an other than temporary impairment should be recognized is consistent with other existing literature  such as staff accounting bulletin no 
 accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities 
we have adopted fsp no 
fas as of december  accordingly  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of approximately million as an offset to interest and other income  net for the year ended december  to write down the carrying value of our marketable securities to fair value 
liquidity and capital resources in millions as of december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities year ended december  cash flows net cash used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities 
table of contents we have financed our operations since inception primarily through private placements and public offerings of debt and equity securities  equipment and leasehold improvement financing  other debt financing and payments under corporate collaborations 
for at least the next months  we expect to be able to fund our operations from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available as of december  we currently estimate that our operating expenses for will be approximately million to million 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december  and resulted primarily from operating losses adjusted for changes in accrued and other liabilities  non cash expenses and changes in restricted cash 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of purchases of marketable securities of million and capital expenditures of million  largely offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of million 
net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  consisted primarily of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of million  largely offset by purchases of marketable securities of million and capital expenditures and other investing activities of million 
in the future  net cash provided by or used in investing activities may fluctuate from period to period due to timing of payments for capital expenditures and maturities sales and purchases of marketable securities 
net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was primarily due to the completion of concurrent public equity and debt financings in july with net proceeds totaling approximately million 
we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share and issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes due additionally  we realized net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of common stock under our financing arrangement with acqua wellington north american equities fund  ltd 
in february  and proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of  shares of common stock through stock options exercised and the employee stock purchase plan 
in august  we redeemed the remaining outstanding million principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due at a premium to the principal amount of the notes 
net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was primarily due to net proceeds of million from the issuance of senior subordinated convertible notes  net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of common stock under our financing agreement with acqua wellington  net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of  shares of common stock under our common stock purchase agreement with mainfield enterprises  inc  and proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of  share of common stock through stock options exercised and the employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by the repurchase of approximately million principal amount of our senior subordinated convertible notes 
we may from time to time seek to retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or conversions or exchanges for equity securities in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such purchases  conversions or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
alternatively  we may from time to time seek to restructure our outstanding debt through exchanges for new debt securities in open market transactions  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
the amounts involved may be material 

table of contents contractual obligations and significant commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of december  thereafter total in thousands convertible notes manufacturing obligations operating leases convertible notes consist of principal and interest payments on our senior subordinated convertible debentures due  our senior subordinated convertible notes due and our senior subordinated convertible notes due the holders of our senior subordinated convertible debentures due may require us to purchase all or a portion of their debentures on may   may  and may   in each case at a price equal to the principal amount of the debentures to be purchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the purchase date 
manufacturing obligations include significant non cancelable orders and minimum commitments under our agreements related to the manufacturing of ranexa 
operating leases consists of minimum lease payments related to real estate leases for our facilities covering  square feet 
as of december   these leases expire between february and april one of the leases is secured by a million irrevocable letter of credit 
in january  we amended another lease which extended the lease term to april with an option to renew for nine years 
minimum payments related to the amended lease have not been included in the above table 
the amended lease provides for net rent reductions of million over five years in return for the issuance of warrants to the landlord and the ground lessor 
the table above excludes any commitments that are contingent upon future events 
in january  we received fda approval for ranexa  resulting in the following commitments we have a commitment related to our license agreement with roche palo alto llc for ranexa 
under our license agreement  we paid an initial license fee  and are obligated to make certain payments to roche  upon receipt of the first and second product approvals for ranexa in any of the following major market countries france  germany  italy  the united states and the united kingdom 
as of december   we have accrued million of the million payment  and expensed this amount as research and development expenses in the year ended december  in february  we paid million to roche in accordance with this agreement 
unless the agreement is terminated  within thirty days of the approval of ranexa in a second major market country  if any  we will owe a second payment of million to roche 
we have a commitment related to an agreement with a vendor whereby amounts are due to them upon the approval of ranexa by the fda for the manufacture of certain materials related to the production of ranexa 
upon fda approval of ranexa  we are required to pay a million milestone and fees based upon the amount of ranexa manufactured until total amounts paid reach million 
in january  we paid million to this vendor in accordance with the agreement 
we have a commitment related to an agreement with quintiles transnational corp 
whereby we are required to engage quintiles to provide million or more of commercialization services by or before six months following the approval of ranexa by the fda 
otherwise  we are obligated to pay quintiles ten percent of the difference between million and the actual amounts of commercialization services we have engaged with them during the end of the six month period following the approval of ranexa 

table of contents risks and uncertainties related to our future capital requirements according to industry statistics  it generally takes to years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the united states 
drug development in the united states and other countries is a process that includes multiple steps defined by the fda under applicable statutes  regulations and guidance documents 
after the preclinical research process of identifying  selecting and testing in animals a potential pharmaceutical compound  the clinical development process begins with the filing of an investigational new drug application  or ind  or equivalent foreign filing  to allow clinical study of the product candidate 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase  and the most significant costs associated with clinical development are usually for phase trials  which tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after the completion of a successful preclinical and clinical development program  a new drug application  or foreign equivalent  must be filed with regulatory authorities  which includes among other things very large amounts of preclinical and clinical data and results and manufacturing related information necessary to support requested approval of the product candidate 
the review and approval process with regulatory authorities is often uncertain  time consuming and costly 
in light of the steps and complexities involved  the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
actual product timelines and costs are subject to enormous variability and are very difficult to predict  as our clinical development programs are updated and changed to reflect the most recent clinical and preclinical data and other relevant information 
in addition  various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the testing  manufacturing  safety reporting  labeling  storage  recordkeeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these regulatory reviews and approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals for our potential products could materially adversely affect our business 
we will continue to incur substantial expenditures for  and devote a significant amount of time to  preclinical testing and clinical trials 
the amounts of the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties that may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources to a significant extent 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including revenues  if any  generated from aceon and ranexa  market acceptance of our approved products  progress in our research  development and commercialization programs  the size and complexity of these programs  the timing  scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative partnerships  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing preclinical and clinical material and other factors not within our control 
we cannot guarantee that the additional financing to meet our capital requirements will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research  development or commercialization programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose  or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
the significant amounts of capital that we are spending to provide and or enhance infrastructure  headcount and inventory to co promote aceon in the united states and to launch and commercialize ranexa in the united states will be lost if we cannot significantly increase the level of united states sales of aceon or achieve market acceptance for ranexa 
our aceon and ranexa commercialization efforts include building our sales and marketing infrastructure  increasing our marketing communications efforts  hiring and deploying a national specialty cardiovascular sales force that includes approximately cardiovascular account specialists and launching ranexa in march if we cannot substantially increase the level of united states sales of aceon or if we do not achieve market acceptance for ranexa  the future benefits of these expenditures and any future commitments of capital will be lost 
the loss of future benefits from this investment may harm our business  increase our cash requirements  increase the volatility of our stock price and result in additional operating losses 
our sales and marketing expenses have increased substantially as we have begun to co promote aceon and launch ranexa in the united states 
we expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially in connection with the market launch of ranexa 

table of contents we may require substantial additional funding in order to complete our research and development activities and commercialize our products and product candidates 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million 
we estimate that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not require or seek additional funding prior to then or that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we have experienced significant operating losses since our inception in  including net losses of million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the process of developing and commercializing our product candidates requires significant research and development work  preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as regulatory approvals  significant marketing and sales efforts  and manufacturing capability 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  require significant investments and are expected to continue to result in operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we have not generated any product revenues to date  and even after we generate revenues relating to aceon  ranexa and other approved products  if any  we may never achieve or sustain profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the exposure to any one issuer except for united states government securities or by one of its agencies 
we are averse to principal loss and strive to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
we classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities as fixed rate if the rate of return on such instruments remains fixed over their term 
these fixed rate investments include us government securities  commercial paper  asset backed securities and corporate bonds 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to a change in interest rates 
we classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities as variable rate if the rate of return on such investments varies based on the change in a predetermined index or set of indices during their term 
as of december   there have been no material changes in these market risks since december  our long term debt at december  includes million of our senior subordinated convertible debentures due  million of our senior subordinated convertible notes due  and million of our senior subordinated convertible notes due  which was issued in july interest on the senior subordinated convertible debentures is fixed and payable semi annually on may and november each year 
interest on the senior subordinated convertible notes is fixed and payable semi annually on may and november each year
