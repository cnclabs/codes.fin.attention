the higher provision in versus was attributable to a number of factors  but was primarily a result of general growth in the loan portfolio as well as higher allocations on specific watch list credits 
the level of loan loss provision is also influenced by other factors related to the growth in the loan portfolio  such as emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentration  new industry lending activity  general economic conditions and historical loss percentages 
in addition  management gives consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision 
management s overall view on current credit quality was also a factor in the determination of the provision for loan losses 
the company s management continues to monitor the adequacy of the provision based on loan levels  asset quality  economic conditions and other factors that may influence the assessment of the collectability of loans 
noninterest income was million in versus million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase primarily resulted from an  gain on the sale of the company s retail credit card portfolio 
management s decision to sell the portfolio was driven by the desire to provide a more fully featured business and retail credit card program to clients

depreciation expense was lower as a result of technology asset additions related to system upgrades in prior years 
most of these assets have now fully depreciated  and still reporesent stable technology platforms 
data processing fees and supplies decreased from million in to million in primarily due to improved pricing with the company s processing agents 
credit card interchange fees increased from million in to million in driven by higher processing costs charged by visa and increased credit card usage 
as a result of these factors  income before income tax expense increased million  or  from million in to million in income tax expense was million in versus million in income tax as a percentage of income before tax was in versus in the higher tax rate resulted from a decreased percentage of the company s income being derived from tax advantaged sources

noninterest income was million in versus million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was driven by a million  or  decrease in gains on sale of mortgages  from million in to  in as mortgage originations decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
as experienced by the industry generally  this decrease was a result of the decreased level of mortgage activity during resulting from consumers having refinanced their homes in and when rates were falling 
additionally  noninterest income decreased due to a  decrease in gains on securities sold 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases of  or  in trust and brokerage fees and  or  in merchant card fee income 
the increase in trust and brokerage fees resulted primarily from the company s december  acquisition of indiana capital management while the increase in merchant card fees was driven by higher volume activity in interchange and merchant fee income 
noninterest expense decreased million  or from million in to million in equipment expense decreased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of lower depreciation expense and personal property tax expenses 
depreciation expense was lower as a result of technology asset additions related to system upgrades driven by yk issues  these assets were fully depreciated in mid credit card interchange fees increased from million in to million in driven by higher processing costs charged by visa and increased credit card usage

the company added no new offices during since  the company has added seventeen new offices through acquisition and internal growth 
the company will consider future acquisition and expansion opportunities with an emphasis on markets that it believes would be receptive to its business philosophy of local  independent banking 
the company sold five branches in its south region during the third quarter of in order to help position the company to focus on growth opportunities in its core northern markets  which are anchored by the cities of warsaw  fort wayne  elkhart and south bend  indiana 
total assets of the company were billion as of december   an increase of million  or  when compared to billion as of december  total cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily attributable to loan growth and the corresponding funding needs associated with that growth 
total securities available for sale increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was a result of a number of activities in the securities portfolio 
paydowns from prepayments of million were received  and the amortization of premiums  net of the accretion of discounts  was million 
maturities  calls and sales of securities totaled million 
the fair value of the securities decreased million as a result of the rising interest rate environment during these portfolio decreases were offset by securities purchases totaling million 
the investment portfolio is managed to limit the company s exposure to risk and contains mostly collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities which are either directly or indirectly backed by the federal government or a local 
table of contents municipal government 
the investment portfolio did not contain any corporate debt instruments or trust preferred instruments as of december  real estate mortgages held for sale decreased by million  or  to  at december  from million at december  the balance of this asset category is subject to a high degree of variability depending on  among other things  recent mortgage loan rates and the timing of loan sales into the secondary market 
during  million in real estate mortgages were originated for sale and million in mortgages were sold  compared to million and million in this lower volume of real estate mortgages originated was caused primarily by the increase in interest rates from historically low levels 
total loans  excluding real estate mortgages held for sale  increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the mix of loan types within the company s portfolio continued a trend toward a higher percentage of the total loan portfolio being in commercial loans 
the portfolio breakdown at year end reflected commercial and industrial and agri business  real estate and consumer loans compared to commercial and industrial and agri business  real estate and consumer loans at december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  versus million  or  of total loans outstanding at december  the process of identifying probable credit losses is a subjective process 
therefore  the company maintains a general allowance to cover probable incurred credit losses within the entire portfolio 
the methodology management uses to determine the adequacy of the loan loss reserve includes the following considerations 
the company has a relatively high percentage of commercial and commercial real estate loans  most of which are extended to small or medium sized businesses 
commercial loans represent higher dollar loans to fewer customers and therefore higher credit risk 
pricing is adjusted to manage the higher credit risk associated with these types of loans 
the majority of fixed rate mortgage loans  which represent increased interest rate risk  are sold in the secondary market  as well as some variable rate mortgage loans 
the remainder of the variable rate mortgage loans and a small number of fixed rate mortgage loans are retained 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is at a level commensurate with the overall risk exposure of the loan portfolio 
however  if economic conditions would become unfavorable certain borrowers may experience difficulty and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision for loan losses 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the uncollectability of the principal is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred credit losses relating to specifically identified loans based on an evaluation  as well as other probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay 
management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon a monthly review of those credits 
an appropriate level of general allowance is determined after considering the following factors application of historical loss percentages  emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentrations  new industry lending activity and current economic conditions 
federal regulations require insured institutions to classify their own assets on a regular basis 
the regulations provide for three categories of classified loans substandard  doubtful and loss 
the regulations also contain a special mention category 
special mention is defined as loans that do not currently expose an insured institution to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification  but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving management s close attention 
assets classified as substandard or doubtful require the institution to establish specific allowances for loan losses 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  the insured institution must either establish specified allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified loss  or charge off such amount 
at december   on the basis of management s review of the loan portfolio  the company had loans totaling million on the classified loan list versus million on december  as of december   the company had million of assets classified special mention  million classified as substandard   classified as doubtful and classified as loss as compared to million  million   and at december  
table of contents allowance estimates are developed by management taking into account actual loss experience  adjusted for current economic conditions 
the company discusses this methodology with regulatory authorities to ensure compliance 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the company s loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
in accordance with fasb statements and  the allowance is provided for losses that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date and is based on past events and current economic conditions  and does not include the effects of expected losses on specific loans or groups of loans that are related to future events or expected changes in economic conditions 
the company has experienced growth in total loans over the last three years of million  or 
the concentration of this loan growth was in the commercial loan portfolio 
commercial loans comprised  and of the total loan portfolio at december   and traditionally  this type of lending may have more credit risk than other types of lending because of the size and diversity of the credits 
the company manages this risk by adjusting its pricing to the perceived risk of each individual credit and by diversifying the portfolio by customer  product  industry and geography 
management has historically considered growth and portfolio composition when determining loan loss allocations 
management believes that it is prudent to continue to provide for loan losses in a manner consistent with its historical approach due to the loan growth described above and current economic conditions 
as a result of the methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the provision for loan losses was million in versus million in at december   total nonperforming loans decreased by million to million from million at december  loans delinquent days or more that were included in the accompanying financial statements as accruing totaled  versus million at december  total impaired loans decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  the decreases in nonperforming loans and impaired loans resulted primarily from the upgrade of a single commercial credit that was classified as impaired because  pursuant to the terms of the loan documentation  it had matured  although the parties were working to have it renewed 
the renewal of the loan in question had been complicated as more than one bank was involved which resulted in it being past maturity 
the renewal issues were resolved in the third quarter of  the participant bank is no longer involved in the credit and the loan is current as to principal and interest 
the million in impaired loans are all in nonaccrual status 
the company allocated million and million of the allowance for loan losses to the impaired loans in and a loan is impaired when full payment under the original loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance may be allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the company believes that the improvement in total nonperforming loans is a reflection of the continued focus on enforcement of a strong credit environment  an aggressive position on loan work out situations and a general improvement in the regional economic conditions 
the allowance for loan loss to total loans percentage was in both and the company does not believe that it has experienced any meaningful change in overall asset quality and that its overall expansion strategy has employed a credit risk management approach that promotes diversification and therefore creates a balanced portfolio with appropriate risk parameters 
furthermore  the company requires that the overall asset quality position can be influenced by a small number of credits due to the focus on commercial lending activity 
total deposits increased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase resulted from increases of million in brokered deposits  million in other certificates of deposit  million in money market transaction accounts  million in demand deposit accounts and million in money market accounts 
offsetting these increases were declines of million in investors money market accounts and million in savings accounts 
total short term borrowings increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted from a million increase in federal funds purchased and million in securities sold under agreements to repurchase combined with decreases of  in us treasury demand notes 

table of contents the company believes that a strong  appropriately managed capital position is critical to long term earnings and expansion 
bank regulatory agencies exclude the market value adjustment created by sfas no 
afs adjustment from capital adequacy calculations 
excluding this adjustment from the calculation  the company had a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier i risk based capital ratio of as of december  these ratios met or exceeded the federal reserve s well capitalized minimums of and  respectively 
the ability to maintain and grow these ratios is a function of the balance between net income and a prudent dividend policy 
total stockholders equity increased by to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in resulted from net income of million less the following factors cash dividends of million  an unfavorable change in the afs adjustment for the market valuation on securities held for sale of million  net of tax  a positive minimum pension liability adjustment of  net of tax   for the acquisition of treasury stock and million related to stock option exercises 
total stockholders equity increased by to million as of december   from million as of december  the increase in resulted from net income of million less the following factors cash dividends of million  an unfavorable change in the afs adjustment for the market valuation on securities held for sale of  net of tax  a positive minimum pension liability adjustment of  net of tax   for the acquisition of treasury stock  million related to stock option exercises and stock compensation expense and  of treasury stock sold and distributed under the deferred directors plan 
the afs adjustment reflected a basis point increase in the two to five year us treasury rates during due to the fact that the securities portfolio is primarily fixed rate  a negative equity adjustment would likely occur if interest rates increased 
management has factored this into the determination of the size of the afs portfolio to assure that stockholders equity is adequate under various scenarios 
other than those indicated in this management s discussion and in the risk factors set forth in this annual report  management is not aware of any known trends  events or uncertainties that would have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital and results of operations 
in addition  management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations that  if implemented  would have such an effect 
critical accounting policies certain of the company s accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances 
some of the facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include changes in interest rates  in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
allowance for loan losses the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable incurred credit losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that a loan will not be repaid 

table of contents subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
allocations of the allowance are made for specific loans and for pools of similar types of loans  although the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged against the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is taken based on management s ongoing evaluation of the appropriate allowance balance 
a formal evaluation of the adequacy of the loan loss allowance is conducted at least monthly and more often if deemed necessary 
the ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the company s control 
the level of loan loss provision is influenced by growth in the overall loan portfolio  emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentration  new industry lending activity  general economic conditions and historical loss analysis 
in addition  management gives consideration to changes in the allocation for specific watch list credits in determining the appropriate level of the loan loss provision 
furthermore  management s overall view on credit quality is a factor in the determination of the provision 
the determination of the appropriate allowance is inherently subjective  as it requires significant estimates 
the company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that generally includes consideration of the following factors changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality and current economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to repay 
consideration is not limited to these factors  although they represent the most commonly cited factors 
with respect to specific allocation levels for individual credits  management generally considers the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows and the valuation of collateral as the primary measures 
management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon an ongoing review of those credits 
with respect to pools of similar loans  we generally use percentage allocations based upon historical analysis 
we may also adjust these allocations for other factors cited above 
an appropriate level of general allowance for pooled loans is determined after considering the following application of historical loss percentages  emerging market risk  commercial loan focus and large credit concentration  new industry lending activity and general economic conditions 
it is also possible that the following could affect the overall process social  political  economic and terrorist events or activities 
all of these factors are susceptible to significant change 
as a result of this detailed process  the allowance results in two forms of allocations  specific and general 
these two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
commercial loans are subject to a dual standardized grading process administered by the credit administration and internal loan review functions 
a credit grade is assigned to each commercial loan by both the commercial loan officer and the loan review department 
these grade assignments are performed independent of each other and may or may not be the same grade 
the loan review grade is the grade assigned in the company s loan system for individual credits 
the need for specific allocation of the loan loss reserve is considered for individual credits when graded special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
other considerations with respect to specific allocations for individual credits include  but are not limited to  the following a does the customer s cash flow or net worth appear insufficient to repay the loan  b is there adequate collateral to repay the loan c has the loan been criticized in a regulatory examination  d is the loan on non accrual  e are there other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or f are there unique loan characteristics require special monitoring 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that we believe indicates the loan is impaired 
allocations are also applied to categories of loans not considered individually impaired but for which the rate of loss is expected to be consistent with or greater than historical averages 
such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values 
in addition  general allocations are made for other pools of loans  including non classified loans 
these general pooled loan allocations are performed for similar portfolios of consumer and residential real estate loans  and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss 
general allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on a five year historical average for loan losses for these portfolios  judgmentally adjusted for economic factors and portfolio trends 
due to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses  the company s allowance for loan losses includes an unallocated component 
the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the company s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations  including factors such as economic uncertainties  industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments  broad portfolio quality trends and trends in the composition of the company s large commercial loan portfolio and related large dollar exposures to individual borrowers 

table of contents mortgage servicing rights valuation mortgage servicing rights msrs are recognized and included with other assets for the allocated value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
servicing rights are expensed in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing revenues 
impairment is evaluated based on the fair value of the rights  using groupings of the underlying loans as to type and interest rate 
fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flows using market based assumptions 
to determine the fair value of msrs  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
in using this valuation method  the company incorporates assumptions that market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income  which include estimates of prepayment speeds  discount rate  cost to service  escrow account earnings  contractual servicing fee income  ancillary income  late fees  and float income 
the most significant assumption used to value msrs is prepayment rate 
in general  during periods of declining interest rates  the value of msrs decline due to increasing prepayment speeds attributable to increased mortgage refinancing activity 
prepayment rates are estimated based on published industry consensus prepayment rates 
prepayments will increase or decrease in correlation with market interest rates and actual prepayments generally differ from initial estimates 
if actual prepayment rates are different than originally estimated  the company may receive less mortgage servicing income  which could reduce the value of the msrs 
other assumptions used in estimating the fair value of msrs do not generally fluctuate to the same degree as prepayment rates  and therefore the fair value of msrs is less sensitive to changes in these other assumptions 
on a monthly basis  the company evaluates the possible impairment of msrs based on the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value of msrs 
for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment  the company stratifies its portfolios on the basis of certain risk characteristics  including loan type and interest rate 
if impairment exists  a valuation allowance is established for any excess of amortized cost over the current fair value  by risk stratification  through a charge to income 
if the company later determines that all or a portion of the impairment no longer exists for a particular strata  a reduction of the valuation allowance may be recorded as an increase to income 
newly issued but not yet effective accounting standards fasb statement revised  share based payment requires expensing of stock options effective for years beginning after june  the company plans to adopt this standard as of january  and will begin expensing any unvested stock options at that time 
the company estimates the expense to be approximately  this amount does not take into account any additional grants that may be done during the year 
fasb staff position fsp the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments is effective for reporting periods after december  fsp fas addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the company does not anticipate the adoption of this standard will have any material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
no other new accounting standards have been issued that are not yet effective that are expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
liquidity management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run off that may occur in the normal course of business 
the company relies on a number of different sources in order to meet these potential liquidity demands 
the primary sources are increases in deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio 
given current prepayment assumptions  the cash flow from the securities portfolio is expected to provide approximately million of funding in 
table of contents in addition to these primary sources of funds  management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements 
as of december   the company had million in federal funds lines with correspondent banks and may borrow up to million at the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
the company has its securities in the available for sale afs portfolio 
therefore the company may sell securities to meet funding demands 
management believes that the securities in the afs portfolio are of high quality and would therefore be marketable 
approximately of this portfolio is comprised of federal agency securities or mortgage backed securities directly or indirectly backed by the federal government 
in addition  the company has historically sold mortgage loans on the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create an additional source of funding 
during  cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million as of december  to million as of december  the primary driver of this decrease was an increase in net loans of million  which is net of approximately million of loans originated and sold during other uses of funds were purchases of securities of million and payments on long term borrowings of million

while management believes that inflation affects the growth of total assets  it believes that it is difficult to assess the overall impact 
management believes this to be the case due to the fact that generally neither the timing nor the magnitude of the inflationary changes in the consumer price index cpi coincides with changes in interest rates 
the price of one or more of the components of the cpi may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall cpi without having a corresponding affect on interest rates or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by the company 
in years of high inflation and high interest rates  intermediate and long term interest rates tend to increase  thereby adversely impacting the market values of investment securities  mortgage loans and other long term fixed rate loans 
in addition  higher short term interest rates caused by inflation tend to increase the cost of funds 
in other years  the reverse situation may occur
