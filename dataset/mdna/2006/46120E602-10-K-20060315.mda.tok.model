item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview products 
we design  manufacture and market the da vinci surgical system  which is an advanced surgical system that we believe represents a new generation of surgery the third generation 
the da vinci surgical system consists of a surgeon s console  a patient side cart  a high performance vision system  proprietary wristed instruments  and various intuitive accessories 
the da vinci surgical system seamlessly translates the surgeon s natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions  or ports 
we believe that the da vinci surgical system is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with the intuitive control  range of motion  fine tissue manipulation capability and d visualization characteristic of open surgery  while simultaneously allowing the surgeons to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery  or mis 
by placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient  we believe that the da vinci surgical system enables surgeons to perform better surgery in a manner never before experienced 
the da vinci surgical system is sold into multiple surgical specialties  principally urologic  cardiothoracic  general  and gynecologic surgeries 
business model 
in our business model  we derive revenue from both the initial capital sales of da vinci surgical systems as well as recurring revenue  comprised of instrument  accessory  service  and training revenue 
the da vinci surgical system sells for approximately million  or more  depending on configuration  and represents a significant capital equipment investment for our customers 
after the initial sale of the da vinci surgical system into customer accounts  we generate recurring revenue as our customers use the da vinci surgical system to perform surgery and  in the process  buy and consume our endowrist instruments and accessory products 
we generate additional revenue from recurring system service and customer training 
we typically enter into five year service contracts  generally renewable at an annual rate of approximately million per year  or more  depending on configuration  with our customers at the time system sales are closed 
as our established base of da vinci surgical systems has grown and system utilization has increased  recurring revenue has grown at a faster rate than capital sales 
as our business has grown  recurring revenue has comprised an increasing percentage of our overall revenue 
over the past four years  revenue generated from the sale of instruments  accessories  service and training increased from million  or of sales  in to million  or of sales in to million  or of sales  in to million  or of sales in we expect a continuation of this trend in business events and trends introduction 
intuitive surgical experienced rapid growth during our financial success was driven by the continued adoption of the da vinci surgical system for use in urologic  cardiothoracic  general  and gynecologic surgeries 
many of the events highlighted below were executed in order to support business growth and to lay the foundation for future expansion 
financial highlights 
during the year  we met or exceeded most of our internal financial goals sales grew to million from million in recurring instrument  accessory  service  and training revenue grew to million  up from million in we sold da vinci surgical systems  an increase of compared to in we ended the year with a da vinci surgical system installed base of systems  in north america  in europe  and in the rest of the world 
gross profit margin improved to from in operating expenses were significantly leveraged in as they grew to million while sales grew

prostatectomy market share capture 
we grew our market share of radical prostatectomy procedures performed in the united states to approximately at the end of  compared to approximately at the end of  based upon an assumed total united states prostatectomy market of  procedures performed annually 
this continuing penetration contributed significantly to our overall sales growth 
regulatory clearances 
in march  the fda granted clearance for the use of the da vinci surgical system for use in urologic procedures 
this clearance broadened the scope of the radical prostatectomy clearance received during may to include all urologic surgery 
with this clearance  we are now able to actively promote the use of the da vinci surgical system for other urologic procedures such as pyeloplasty  nephrectomy  and cystectomy 
in april  the fda granted clearance for use of the da vinci surgical system for use in gynecological procedures 
with this clearance  we have now begun to actively market the da vinci surgical system in gynecology 
we believe that the da vinci surgical system has the potential to address a significant portion of the sizable hysterectomy market  specifically cases relating to cancer and complex fibroid conditions 
since we have only recently begun to market in this area  it is too early to determine how successful we will be in gaining market share of hysterectomy procedures 
in june  the fda granted clearance for use of the da vinci surgical system for use in pediatric procedures 
pediatrics is a relatively small market for us  however we believe that the da vinci surgical system will provide value in this area 
the following table lists chronologically our fda clearances to date july general laparoscopic procedures march non cardiac thoracoscopic procedures may prostatectomy procedures november cardiotomy procedures july cardiac revascularization procedures march urologic surgical procedures april gynecologic surgical procedures june pediatric surgical procedures we believe that we have obtained all of the clearances required to market our products to our targeted surgical specialties within the united states 
new products 
in january  we launched the da vinci s surgical system 
the da vinci s surgical system shares the same core technology as the standard da vinci surgical system and also features fast setup  rapid instrument exchange  multi quadrant access and multi image display capabilities 
the da vinci s surgical system is an addition to the da vinci product line and will be offered at a price approximately million above the standard four arm da vinci surgical system price 
we will continue to sell  service and support the standard da vinci surgical system 
we will also continue to invest in product development in order to expand the utility and longevity of all da vinci surgical systems  instruments and accessories 
we launched several new instrument products during  including the energy based  monopolar shears and the harmonic shears  which we co developed with ethicon endosurgery  inc as we continue to expand our instrument offering  we provide our customers more surgical options and clinical capability  leading to increased system usage 

table of contents facilities and information technology infrastructure 
we have made investments in facilities and information technology infrastructure to support current and future growth 
during the second quarter of  we completed a  sq ft expansion of manufacturing and office space within our existing  square foot sunnyvale facility 
in late december  we invested approximately million to acquire an additional  square foot facility  located about one mile from our current sunnyvale site 
we will continue to maintain operations in our existing sunnyvale site 
the acquisition of this new property triples our square footage in sunnyvale and provides us with the necessary capacity to maintain all of our corporate functions  including manufacturing  together in sunnyvale for several years to come 
we are also investing in information technology infrastructure as we have embarked on a project to upgrade our general ledger and manufacturing systems to a new sap system 
we expect to implement this new system around the middle of total capital expenditures for  including the purchase of the new facility and transfers of equipment from inventory  were nearly million 
technology acquisitions 
in september  we entered into a cross license agreement with hansen medical  inc to co exclusively license a number of robotic surgery related patents and applications in the fields of endoscopic  laparascopic thoracoscopic  or open diagnoses and or surgeries 
in december  we purchased three patents related to image guided surgery from ibm 
in january  we licensed on a non exclusive basis a number of suction stabilizer related patents and applications from medtronic to make and sell suction stabilizers that are mechanically coupled to and manipulated by robotic devices

table of contents overall sales overall sales increased from million in to million in to million in overall sales growth was driven by the continued adoption of da vinci surgery  which enables surgeons and medical centers to provide robotic surgical procedures to their patients 
we believe that the adoption of robotic surgery will occur surgical procedure by surgical procedure 
our sales growth during the periods presented reflects adoption progress made in our target procedures 
da vinci prostatectomy dvp has been our most successful procedure to date and has been a significant sales catalyst 
assuming a total prostatectomy surgery market of approximately  in the united states annually  we believe that we ended capturing approximately of the total us market  compared to ending  and ending we believe that this market share has been driven by patient demand as patients now routinely search for their best treatment option 
an increasing body of clinical evidence has reported dvp to offer superior surgical outcomes compared to traditional open prostatectomy in the critical categories of cancer removal  continence  and sexual potency  combined with the obvious benefits of moving an open procedure to a minimally invasive approach  such as reduced pain  scarring  and blood loss  and a quicker return to normal daily activities 
sales within the united states accounted for of total sales in  in  and in domestic sales are growing faster than international sales and account for the large majority of total sales due largely to the competitive maturity of the domestic healthcare market 
we believe that at this stage  as we penetrate the early adopters of robotic surgery that sales will continue to concentrate in the us market  as us hospitals are generally more willing to invest in technology that will drive incremental patients into their healthcare systems 
we believe that as adoption progresses and we reach standard of care for target procedures  international sales will become a larger percentage of overall sales

table of contents income tax benefit expense our income tax benefit was million for  compared to income tax expense of million in there was no income tax expense recorded for the year ended december  our income tax included a one time deferred tax benefit of million related to the reversal of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of management has concluded  based upon recent operating results  expectations of future taxable income  carryforward periods available to us  and other factors  that it is more likely than not that we will realize sufficient earnings to utilize our deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets arose from federal and state net operating loss carry forwards  federal and state tax credit carry forwards as well as from other timing differences 
historically  these deferred tax assets had been offset in total by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our deferred tax assets 
the release of the valuation allowance and the resulting recognition of a deferred tax benefit in was based on management s belief that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
our income tax was million 
this tax represented taxes due on income not covered by net operating loss carry forwards 
in  we recorded a net loss for the year and recorded no income tax expense 
we expect that most of the income tax recorded in will not result in cash outlays during that year due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards as well as deductions due to employee stock options 
at december   we had approximately million and million in federal and state net operating loss carry forwards  respectively  to reduce future taxable income 
of these amounts  million and million  respectively  relate to stock option deductions that are not included in our deferred tax accounts as we will not recognize these deductions until they are utilized 
the federal and state carry forwards have expiration dates beginning in and  respectively  if not utilized 
at december   we had research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purposes  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million  respectively  relate to stock option deductions that are not included in our deferred tax accounts as we will not recognize these credits until they are utilized 
if not utilized  the federal research and development tax credit carry forwards will begin to expire in the state research and development tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments of million  compared to million at december  and million at december  working capital at december  was million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the million increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments during resulted primarily from cash provided from operating activities of million and proceeds from employee stock purchase and option plans of million  partially offset by net fixed asset additions of million 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments resulted primarily from our net income of million  non cash expenses of million and proceeds from employee stock purchase and option plans of million  partially offset by net fixed asset additions of million 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents and investments and working capital resulted primarily from million of net proceeds received from our follow on stock offering  offset mostly by the computer motion acquisition 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and net cash used in operating activities of million in net cash provided by operating activities in of million resulted primarily from pre tax income of million and non cash expenses of million  partially offset by million of working capital requirements

net cash used in operating activities in resulted from a net loss of million and working capital requirements of million  partially offset by non cash expenses of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in net cash used in investing activities in resulted primarily from the net movement into investments from cash received from profitable operations and the purchase of the additional three building campus in sunnyvale  california 
net cash used in investing activities in resulted primarily from the net movement into short term investments from cash received from profitable operations along with the purchase of the land and building at our headquarters 
net cash used in investing activities in resulted primarily from the net movement into short term investments from cash received from the follow on offering proceeds 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for the net cash provided by financing activities resulted from million of employee stock purchases and option and warrant exercise proceeds  offset partially by debt repayment of million 
the net cash provided by financing activities resulted from million of employee stock purchases and option and warrant exercise proceeds  offset by debt repayment of million 
the net cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from our follow on common stock offering yielding million of net proceeds  with the remainder coming mostly from employee stock purchases and option exercises 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to expand our customer support and product development activities and for other general corporate activities 
during  we experienced significant business expansion 
we grew sales  invested in new facilities  began a project to upgrade our information technology systems  and grew our organization by over 
in this high growth year  we generated million of operating income  which represented the major driver of the net cash provided by operating activities in based upon our business model  we anticipate that we will continue to be able to fund future growth through cash provided from operations 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investment balances  together with income to be derived from the sale of our products  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future
