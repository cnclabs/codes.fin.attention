item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the information set forth under selected historical financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere herein 
the statements in this discussion regarding our expectations regarding our future performance  liquidity and capital resources and other non historical statements in this discussion are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described under risk factors and forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward looking statements 
company history our business was founded in as gte telecommunication services inc  a unit of gte 
in early  gte combined our business with its intelligent network services business to further broaden our network services offering 
in june  when gte and bell atlantic merged to form verizon communications inc  we became an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of verizon 
in february  we were acquired from verizon by members of our senior management team and an investor group led by gtcr golder rauner  llc gtcr 
at the time of our acquisition from verizon on february   we anticipated that our future revenues from verizon wireless would decrease 
the expected decline in verizon wireless revenues was based on a number of specific events  including verizon wireless planned movement of certain services in house and the termination of verizon wireless contract with us relating to the technology supporting the onstar application 
in anticipation of this decrease  we entered into a revenue guaranty agreement on february  pursuant to which verizon information services agreed to pay us of the amount  if any  by which our annual revenues from verizon wireless and certain of its affiliates were less than specified annual revenue minimums beginning from the date of the acquisition and continuing through december  the revenue minimums were million for the period from february  to december   million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  these agreed upon revenue minimums compare to million of revenues from verizon wireless 
although our revenues from verizon wireless have declined following our acquisition from verizon  these revenues still exceeded the revenue minimums in  and as a result  we have not received and do not expect to receive any payments under the verizon wireless revenue guaranty as this agreement has expired 
at the time of the acquisition  we also had identified several other customers that we believed might cease using our clearinghouse  call processing and prepaid wireless services during and we expected a reduction in cingular wireless revenues due to contractual arrangements made by cingular wireless parent company as part of the sale of its international clearinghouse business  whereby cingular wireless was required to move its clearinghouse business to the buyer as part of a multi year agreement 
as a result  our clearinghouse revenues from cingular wireless declined from million in to million in  which was the year that the contract was terminated 
virtually all of the cingular wireless clearinghouse business was moved to this other provider prior to our acquisition from verizon 
in addition  we anticipated declines in our call processing services and enterprise solutions revenues 
the decline in call processing was attributable to technology developments that have resulted in traditional call processing functionality being incorporated into more cost effective ss network solutions 
ss is the telecommunications industry s standard network signaling protocol used by substantially all carriers to enable critical telecommunications functions such as line busy signals  toll free calling services and caller id 
this has resulted in customers increasingly moving from our call processing solution to our ss network  a competitor s ss network  in house ss networks and or direct connections with roaming partners 
call processing services revenues declined million from million from to million for call processing 
table of contents services revenues declined million from million for to million for call processing services revenues declined million from million for to million for these declines have been in line with our expectations 
we expect the decline to continue 
enterprise solutions revenues declined million from million in to million in  of which million was attributed to our prepaid services offering 
the decline was primarily the result of a decision by a customer to move to its parent company s prepaid wireless platform following an acquisition 
this customer s decision to stop using our prepaid services was made prior to our acquisition from verizon 
we have discontinued offering any prepaid services and we no longer earn revenues from these services 
these revenue declines were partially offset by continued strength in our clearinghouse services driven by growth from existing customers or services  which we refer to as organic volume growth  and the addition of new customers 
in addition  we have experienced revenue growth driven by increased intelligent network database query volumes  messaging volumes and signaling 
furthermore  the introduction of number portability services has contributed significantly to the growth of our business over this period 
in order to encourage higher customer transaction volumes  our pricing strategy generally includes negotiating tiered pricing schedules with our customers based on certain established transaction volume levels 
as a result  the average price per transaction for many of our products has declined over time as customers have increasingly used our services and transaction volumes have grown 
we expect this trend to continue 
on february   syniverse holdings  llc syniverse llc entered into an amendment no 
to limited liability company agreement and dissolution agreement  dated as of february   with syniverse holdings  inc syniverse inc and certain members of syniverse llc the dissolution agreement 
the dissolution agreement provided  among other things  for i the distribution of the capital stock of syniverse inc to the members of syniverse llc  ii the termination of certain equity agreements among syniverse llc and its members and iii the subsequent dissolution of syniverse llc 
on february   we merged our subsidiaries  syniverse networks and syniverse finance  with and into syniverse technologies  inc syniverse 
on february   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price of per common share 
the net proceeds of the offering were million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and expenses  and  along with the million received from our new credit facility  were used primarily to redeem  shares of our class a cumulative redeemable preferred stock as described below  tender for of our senior subordinated notes and repay our previous senior credit facility 
on february   we redeemed  shares of our class a cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock including accrued and unpaid dividends with million of proceeds received from our initial public offering completed on february  on march   we converted the remaining  shares of our class a cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock including accrued and unpaid dividends at a liquidation value of million into  shares of our class a common stock 
acquisitions on july   we merged with brience 
in connection with the merger  the former stockholders of brience received an aggregate of  common units of syniverse holdings  llc  which represented approximately of the outstanding common units 
the principal operations of brience  now known as syniverse brience  at the time of the merger included the sale and servicing of its mobile processing server product  an integrated software design and development environment for building mobile solutions that control formatting for wireless devices 

table of contents since the funds associated with gtcr had a controlling interest in both brience and syniverse llc at the time of the merger  the transaction was accounted for as a combination of entities under common control  similar to a pooling of interests 
accordingly  our historical consolidated financial statements include the financial results of brience beginning on the date when the funds associated with gtcr had common control of both entities february  
brience s pre acquisition net loss included in our historical results of operations was million and million for the period between february  and december  and the period between january  and july   respectively 
on december   we acquired softwright holdings limited for million cash and the assumption of liabilities of million 
softwright holdings limited  now known as syniverse holdings limited  develops software products and services for mobile operators and enterprise customers 
syniverse holdings limited also provides mobile number portability services throughout europe and is the sole provider of these services in the united kingdom 
under the terms of the acquisition  we agreed to make a payment not to exceed million to the former owners of the acquired company no later than march  if this operation achieved a certain predetermined profitability level  as measured by ebitda  for the period ended october  no payments were required under the earn out provision of the acquisition agreement because the softwright subsidiary did not achieve the negotiated ebitda targets 
on september   we acquired the wireless clearinghouse business of ios north america from eds 
we paid million on the date of the acquisition and an additional million in january resulting from the settlement of the final working capital adjustment pursuant to the purchase agreement 
we financed the acquisition through increased borrowings under our previous senior credit facility and available cash 
the primary services of ios north america include wireless voice and data clearinghouse services 
these post acquisition revenues are reported in technology interoperability services 
introduction we provide an integrated suite of services that simplify wireless technology complexities by integrating disparate wireless carriers systems and networks in order to provide seamless global voice and data communications to wireless subscribers 
these services include technology interoperability services 
we operate the largest wireless clearinghouse in the world that enables the accurate invoicing and settlement of domestic and international wireless roaming telephone calls and wireless data events 
we also provide sms and mms routing and translation services between carriers 
network services 
through our ss network  we connect disparate wireless carrier networks and enable access to intelligent network database services like caller id and provide translation and routing services to support the delivery and establishment of telephone calls 
number portability services 
our number portability services are used by many wireless carriers  including the five largest domestic carriers  to enable wireless subscribers to switch service providers while keeping the same telephone number 
call processing services 
we provide wireless carriers global call handling and fraud management solutions that allow wireless subscribers from one carrier to make and accept telephone calls while roaming on another carrier s network 
enterprise solutions 
our enterprise wireless data management platform allows carriers to offer large corporate customers reporting and analysis tools to manage telecom related expenses 
off network database queries 
we provide our network customers with access to various third party intelligent network databases 

table of contents revenues most of our revenues are transaction based and derived from long term contracts  typically with terms averaging three years in duration 
most of the services and solutions we offer to our customers are based on applications  network connectivity and technology platforms owned and operated by us 
a small amount of our revenues are generated through software license sales 
we generate our revenues through the sale of our technology interoperability services  network services  number portability services  call processing services and enterprise solutions to telecommunications carriers throughout the world 
in order to encourage higher customer transaction volumes  we generally negotiate tiered and flat rate pricing schedules with our customers based on certain established transaction volume levels 
as a result  the average per transaction fee for many of our products has declined over time as customers have increasingly used our services and transaction volumes have grown 
we expect this trend to continue 
generally  there is also a slight increase in wireless roaming telephone usage and corresponding revenues in the high travel months of the second and third fiscal quarters 
future increases or decreases in revenues are dependent on many factors  such as industry subscriber growth  with few of these factors known in advance 
from time to time  specific events such as customer contract renewals at different terms  a customer contract termination  a customer s decision to change technologies or to provide solutions in house  will be known to us and then we can estimate their impact on our revenues 
set forth below is a brief description of our primary service offerings and associated revenue recognition technology interoperability services 
we operate the largest wireless clearinghouse in the world that enables the accurate invoicing and settlement of domestic and international wireless roaming telephone calls and wireless data events 
we also provide sms and mms routing and translation services between carriers 
wireless carriers send data records to our service platforms for processing  aggregation  translation and distribution among carriers 
we primarily generate revenues by charging per transaction processing fees based on the number of data messaging records provided to us by wireless carriers for our wireless roaming clearinghouse  sms and mms routing services and wireline network access billing 
we recognize revenues at the time the transactions are processed 
over time  we expect the average per transaction fee for certain services to continue to decline as a result of our volume based pricing strategy as well as potential competitive pricing pressure 
network services 
through our ss network  we connect disparate wireless carrier networks and enable access to intelligent network database services like caller id 
we also provide translation and routing services to support the delivery and establishment of telephone calls 
ss is the telecommunications industry s standard network signaling protocol used by substantially all carriers to enable critical telecommunications functions such as line busy signals  toll free calling services and caller id 
we primarily generate revenues by charging either per transaction or fixed processing fees determined by expected customer volumes 
in addition  our customers pay monthly connection fees based on the number of network connections as well as the number of switches with which a customer communicates 
the per transaction fees are based on the number of intelligent network messages and intelligent network database queries made through our network and are recognized as revenues at the time the transactions are processed 
over time  we expect the average per transaction fee for certain services will continue to decline as a result of our volume based pricing strategy and potential competitive pricing pressures 
number portability services 
we provide number portability services to the wireless industry 
when wireless subscribers choose to change carriers but keep their existing telephone number  the former carrier must send the subscribers information to the new carrier 
our services perform the necessary processing between the two carriers to allow the subscribers to change service providers while keeping their existing telephone number 
we primarily generate revenues by charging per transaction processing fees  monthly fixed fees and fees for customer implementations 
we recognize processing revenues at the time the transactions and services are processed 
we recognize monthly fixed fees as revenues on a monthly basis as the services are performed 
we defer revenues and incremental customer specific costs 
table of contents related to customer implementations and recognize these fees and costs on a straight line basis over the shorter of the life of the initial customer agreement or the period remaining until the amended contract end date for those contracts terminated early 
call processing services 
we provide wireless carriers global call handling and fraud management solutions that allow wireless subscribers from one carrier to make and accept calls while roaming on another carrier s network 
we primarily generate revenues by charging per transaction processing fees based on the number of validation  authorization and other call processing messages generated by wireless subscribers 
we recognize processing fee revenues at the time the transactions are processed 
we expect our call processing revenues will continue to decline as a result of technology developments that have resulted in traditional call processing functionality being incorporated into more cost effective ss network solutions 
this has resulted in customers increasingly replacing our call processing solution with our ss network  competitor ss networks  in house ss networks and or direct connections with roaming partners 
enterprise solutions services 
our enterprise wireless data management platform allows carriers to offer large corporate customers reporting and analysis tools to manage telecom related expenses 
we primarily generate revenues by charging per subscriber fees 
we recognize these revenues at the time the service is performed 
we expect a gradual decline in these revenues 
off network database queries 
through interconnection with other carrier networks  we have access to other service providers databases that support caller id and toll free routing 
if one of our customers uses our network to access another service provider s database  we are charged fees for access to that database 
we pass these charges onto our customers  with little or no margin  based upon the charges we receive from these database providers 
we recognize revenues at the time the transaction is performed 
over time  these revenues are expected to continue to decline as customers seek direct connections with the database providers 
for more information about how we recognize revenues for each of our service categories  please see the discussion below under critical accounting policies and estimates 
costs and expenses our costs and expenses consist of cost of operations  sales and marketing  general and administrative and depreciation and amortization 
cost of operations includes data processing costs  network costs  royalty costs  personnel costs associated with service implementation  training and customer care and off network database query charges 
sales and marketing includes personnel costs  advertising costs  trade show costs and relationship marketing costs 
general and administrative consists primarily of research and development expenses  a portion of the expenses associated with our facilities  internal management expenses  business development expenses  and expenses for finance  legal  human resources and other administrative departments 
in addition  we incur significant service development costs 
these costs  which are primarily personnel  relate to technology creation  enhancement and maintenance of new and existing services 
historically  most of these costs are expensed and recorded as general and administrative expenses 
the capitalized portion  which is recorded as capitalized software costs  relates to costs incurred during the application development stage for the new service offerings and significant service enhancements 
depreciation and amortization relate primarily to our property and equipment including our ss network  infrastructure facilities related to information management and other intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting

table of contents revenues total revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for excluding off network database query fees  total revenues increased million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was primarily due to organic volume growth in technology interoperability services  the addition of ios north america results  growth in network services and number porting services revenues offset in part by decreases in call processing services and enterprise solutions services revenues 
during the fourth quarter of  we renewed our contract with verizon wireless 
consistent with our overall pricing strategy  the terms of the new contract reflect lower pricing that will  in the near term  reduce our revenues from this customer 
the impact was approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in over an extended time period  we believe these decreases will likely be offset in part by higher transaction volumes as well as additional service offerings to verizon wireless 
technology interoperability services revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in revenues was primarily due to organic volume growth in our wireless clearinghouse services and the acquisition of ios north america  partially offset by a decline in per transaction fees pursuant to our volume based pricing strategy for certain services and a competitive pricing environment 
network services revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in revenues was primarily due to volume growth in our gsm transport and intelligent network database services  partially offset by a decline in per transaction fees pursuant to our volume based pricing strategy for certain of our services and a competitive pricing environment 
in addition  two of our ss customers announced that they intended to replace our ss network solution 
we expect this development to reduce network services revenues by approximately to million  depending on the timing of the replacement 
number portability services revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in revenues was primarily due to higher porting activity 
during the fourth quarter of  we received notice from sprint of its intention to move number portability error resolution services provided by us to its own internal platforms effective may  however  we continued to provide limited number portability error resolution services to sprint until december  in april  we signed a transitional support services agreement with sprint to assist in their migration of the number portability error resolution services to their internal platforms 
we have accelerated the amortization of deferred sprint implementation fees and the associated deferred sprint implementation costs to fully amortize these over the year ended december  we also amortized the transition fee over the fiscal year 
based on this new agreement  the number portability revenues from sprint were relatively comparable to revenues  however  we will no longer have any revenues from sprint for these services in future years 
this decrease in revenues will be partially offset by decreased costs associated with providing these services 
we expect to continue providing sprint with number portability services other than number portability error resolution services 
however  we expect this sprint decision to reduce revenues by approximately million  excluding the effect of any new or expanded services 
call processing services revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decline in call processing revenues was attributable to technology developments that have resulted in traditional call processing functionality being incorporated into more cost effective ss network solutions

we expect this decline to continue 
off network database queries revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by customers moving to direct access and billing arrangements with third party intelligent network database providers 
we pass off network database query fees onto our customers  with little or no margin  based upon the charges we receive from the third party database providers 
we expect this decline to continue

other  net was million for the year ended december  the gain is the result of the sale of marketable securities in the fourth quarter of provision for income taxes increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for our provision primarily represents the increase in deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill 
primarily as a result of our impairment loss in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  excluding deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill 
we expect to continually evaluate this allowance and will reduce it as the utilization of these nols becomes more likely than not 
the deferred tax assets arise primarily from federal net operating losses  which expire between and these losses relate primarily to brience s operations in periods prior to february  in addition  because we do not amortize goodwill for financial reporting purposes and cannot predict if or when this deferred tax liability will be payable  we are unable to consider these goodwill related deferred tax liabilities at december  in this analysis of our valuation allowance

the new notes have substantially identical terms of the original notes  except that the new notes have been registered under the securities act of  as amended 
effect of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor  equipment and new materials 
we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december  and non gaap financial measures ebitda we determine ebitda by adding net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization to net income loss 
reconciliations of both net income loss and cash flows from operations to ebitda are presented in the financial tables contained herein 
we rely on ebitda as a primary measure to review and assess the operating performance of our company and our management team in connection with our executive compensation and bonus plans 
we also use ebitda to compare our current operating results with corresponding periods and with the operating results of other companies in our industry 
we believe that it is useful to investors to provide disclosures of our operating results on the same basis as that used by our management 
we also believe that it can assist investors in comparing our performance to that of other companies on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation  amortization  interest or taxes  which do not directly affect our operating performance 
in addition  we also utilize ebitda as an assessment of our liquidity and our ability to meet our debt service obligations and satisfy our debt covenants  which are partially based on ebitda 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for net income  cash flows from operating activities and other consolidated income or cash flows statement data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
some of these limitations are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  ebitda does not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments  and other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda differently than we do  thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of performance in compliance with gaap 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda only supplementally 
see our consolidated statements of operations and our consolidated statements of cash flows included in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from six categories technology interoperability services  network services  number portability services  call processing services  enterprise solutions and off network database queries 
the revenue recognition policy for each of these areas is described under revenues above due to our billing cycles  which for some of our products lag as much as days after the calendar month in which the services are rendered  we estimate the amounts of unbilled revenue each reporting period 
our estimates are based on recent volume and pricing trends adjusted for material changes in contracted service  because actual information is not available immediately 
based on a retrospective review of our actual billings compared to our estimates  our estimates have been reasonable 
historically  our estimates have approximated our actual subsequently billed revenue 
unanticipated changes in volume and pricing trends or material changes in contracted service could adversely affect our estimates of unbilled revenue 
this estimate is critical to our financial statements because it impacts revenue and amounts recorded as accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
as of december   our estimated unbilled revenues were million 
a change in our estimate would result in either an increase or decrease in revenues and accounts receivable of approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay their invoices to us in full 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
a portion of this analysis is dependent on our ability to gather reliable information about our customers specific circumstances 
as part of our analysis  we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is necessary based on the risk category using the factors described above 
based on the circumstances  we place each customer into a risk category and assign reserve percentages between and 
our estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts have tracked well with our actual experience of customers who are unable to pay their invoices in full 
however  uncollectible accounts that are not identified or properly assessed in our review could have a significant impact on our bad debt provision 
in addition  if our customers financial condition or the economy in general deteriorates  we may need to increase these allowances for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts has approximated our bad debt experience 
excluding all risk categories that are reserved at  a change in each one of our risk categories would cause our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and our bad debt expense for the year then ended to change by million 
because we perform our analysis and establish reserves on a customer by customer basis  we generally do not record a general reserve 
however  if we were to apply a general reserve of to our unreserved accounts receivable balance  it would increase our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and our bad debt expense for the year then ended by approximately million 
allowance for credit memos we maintain a general reserve based on our historical credit memo activity 
in addition  we establish credit memo reserves resulting from specific customer matters 
this allowance is recorded as a direct reduction of 
table of contents accounts receivable and revenues 
since our allowances for credit memos are derived in large part from specific customer matters  our estimates have tracked well with our actual credit memo experience 
if our billing errors or discrepancies are not resolved satisfactorily or our customers disputes over billing are not resolved satisfactorily  increases to the allowance would be required 
recently  we have resolved some of these customer matters more favorably than originally estimated but we cannot provide any assurance this will continue 
as of december   our allowance for credit memos totaled million 
if our allowance for credit memos  including identified specific customer matters  changed by  our allowance for credit memos and revenues would change by approximately million 
impairment losses on long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangibles with definite lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we also evaluate the useful life of our assets each reporting period  and if deemed to be shorter than originally estimated  would result in an increase in our annual depreciation and or amortization expense 
other than the decision to abandon our trademark  we have not had reason to adjust our estimated lives on these assets 
the impairment review consists of a comparison of the carrying value of the assets with the assets expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest costs 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is deemed to not be recoverable if it exceeds the sum of its undiscounted cash flows 
estimates of expected future cash flows are management s best estimate based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  asset impairment charges may be required 
management continues to evaluate overall industry and company specific circumstances and conditions to identify indicators of impairment 
during the third quarter of  indicators of impairment based on anticipated declines in call processing and the discontinuation of a carrier s use of our access billing services resulted in the company recording a million impairment charge for certain capitalized software  which thereafter had a carrying value of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million on our customer base intangible assets resulting from a technology interoperability customer s recent notification to us that it does not intend to renew its contract for these services 
as aforementioned  the impairments recorded were based on the discounted expected future cash flows for which these assets will provide future economic benefit 
a decrease in our expected future cash flows with respect to these particular service offerings as well as a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used would have resulted in an approximate million increase in the impairment loss recorded 
we recorded no impairment charges for the year ended december  impairment losses on goodwill and trademark we evaluate goodwill and our non amortizable intangible assets  such as trademarks  for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
our evaluation consisted of measuring the trademark by using a discounted cash flow model and comparing the fair value to the carrying value 
an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill is measured by a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of our reporting unit  using a discounted cash flow model  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill 
estimates of expected future cash flows represent management s best estimate based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  an impairment loss may be required to be recognized 
management will continue to evaluate overall industry and company specific circumstances and conditions as necessary 
no impairment was recognized in the year ended december  
table of contents restructuring we have made estimates of the costs to be incurred as a part of our various restructuring plans 
we have also made estimates in september related to our acquisition of ios north america which was recorded as a part of our purchase accounting 
in addition  on september   we formulated a restructuring plan to eliminate redundant positions at our syniverse holdings limited subsidiary 
as a result  we incurred million in severance related costs in the third quarter of the payments related to this restructuring plan were completed in december at december   our remaining restructuring accrual related to the ios north america acquisition totaled million 
we expect to pay the remaining restructuring costs in the balance in this account at december  continues to represent our best estimate 
loss contingencies we are involved in asserted and unasserted claims  which arise in the ordinary course of our business 
we routinely evaluate whether a loss is probable  and if so  whether it can be estimated 
estimates are based on similar case law matters  consultation with subject matter experts and information obtained through negotiations with counter parties 
as such  accurately depicting the outcome of pending litigation requires considerable judgment and is subject to material differences on final settlement 
accruals for probable losses are recorded in accrued expenses  or as a part of our allowance for credit memos if the dispute relates to a customer matter 
if our assessment of the probability is inaccurate  we may need to record additional accruals or reduce recorded accruals later 
in addition  we may need to adjust our estimates of the probable loss amounts as further information is obtained or we consider settlements 
historically  we have had few changes in estimates for these accruals 
the most significant claim against us is the sbc communications  inc  d b a sbc ameritech  sbc southwestern bell and sbc pacific bell collectively  sbc claim in the amount of million  which alleges that we overcharged sbc for services we provided to it 
we deny these claims  believe that they are unfounded and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
we are presently engaged in arbitration and litigation 
we have accrued our estimate of loss  but there could be differences  which we are unable to estimate presently 
in addition  protracted litigation would also cause us to incur legal fees  which we are unable to estimate presently 
purchase accounting we have made estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired as of february   the softwright acquisition in december and the acquisition of ios north america in september  based primarily on appraisals from third parties and also based on certain internally generated information 
if the subsequent actual and updated projections of the underlying business activity change as compared to the underlying assumptions and projections used to develop these fair values  then we could experience impairment losses  as described above 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain of these assets and these lives were used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  then additional depreciation or amortization expense could be incurred on an annual basis 
we have not made any changes in these areas 
if the estimates of the economic lives on the definite lived intangible assets acquired as of february  were reduced by one year  our amortization expense would increase by approximately million 
income taxes we review our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to evaluate their recoverability based on projections of the turnaround timing of our deferred tax liabilities  projections of future taxable income  and tax planning strategies that we might employ to utilize such assets  including net operating loss carryforwards 
unless it is more likely than not that we will recover such assets through the above means  we establish a valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due primarily to changes in the valuation allowance 
brience had incurred net operating losses since inception and hence was unable to recognize the benefit of these losses in its financial statements tax provision 

table of contents as a result of a review undertaken at december  and each quarter since then and based on the positive and negative evidence described in financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  we concluded that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets excluding deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill 
deferred tax liabilities arising from goodwill were excluded from our consideration of the valuation allowance because goodwill is not amortized for book purposes 
as a result  the timing of the turnaround of these deferred tax liabilities is not predictable in a manner that would allow us to offset the deferred tax assets 
since december  and continuing through december   we have had substantial negative evidence resulting from our cumulative loss position  which has led us to conclude  under sfas that a full valuation is required 
if we emerge from the cumulative loss position  we could conclude that the valuation allowance should be reduced and this would favorably impact our effective tax rate 
the valuation allowance as of december  and was and million  respectively 
in the future  our evaluation of the need for the valuation allowance will be significantly influenced by our ability to achieve profitability and our ability to predict and achieve future projections of taxable income 
we have significant federal nols and capital losses totaling approximately million and million  respectively  many of which we succeeded to as a result of our merger with brience 
all of our nols remain subject to examination and adjustment by the internal revenue service 
we do not believe that any of our nols are currently subject to any limitation under section of the code 
however  the nols acquired from brience are subject to the separate return limitation rules under the consolidated return regulations 
as a result  these nols generally can be utilized only to offset income from the consolidated group of corporations or their successors that generated such losses 
in addition  under section of the code  a corporation that undergoes an ownership change generally may utilize its pre change nols only to the extent of an annual amount determined by multiplying the applicable long term tax exempt rate by the equity value of such corporation 
a corporation generally undergoes an ownership change if the percentage of stock of the corporation owned by one or more stockholders has increased by more than percentage points over a three year period 
we do not believe the consummation of our initial public offering resulted in an ownership change under section of the code 
it is impossible for us to ensure that an ownership change will not occur in the future as changes in our stock ownership  some of which are outside of our control  could result in an ownership change under section of the code 
for example  the sale by one or more stockholders of our common stock and changes in the beneficial ownership of such stock could result in an ownership change under section of the code 
similarly  the exercise of outstanding stock options by our employees would count for purposes of determining whether we had an ownership change 
if we undergo an ownership change  our ability to utilize nols could be limited by section of the code 
the extent to which our use of our nols would be limited depends on a number of legal and factual determinations  some of which may be subject to varying interpretations  including the date on which an ownership change occurs  the long term tax exempt rate  whether the equity value of the entire company or only one or more of its subsidiaries would be used in the application of the section limitation and the equity value of the company or such subsidiaries  as applicable 
if it is determined that an ownership change has occurred prior to july   there is a significant risk that the amount of nols acquired from brience that would be useable in any one year after the ownership change would be severely limited 
if the limitation were significant  our limited ability to use these nols to offset future taxable income could materially increase our future us federal income tax liability 
stock based compensation we use the fair value of our company and of our common stock in determining whether we are required to recognize compensation expense as a result of any of our stock option grants 

table of contents prior to february   the date of our initial public offering  we determined the fair value of our company and the underlying value of the shares of our common stock based on internally generated valuations which we prepared contemporaneously with our stock option grants in the first and third quarters of we used the income approach using the discounted cash flow methodology and we believe that our methodologies were comparable to those that a third party would use 
our board of directors established the exercise price of all options issued under our stock option plans significantly above the fair value that the board of directors determined for the underlying common stock using the discounted cash flow methodology 
for these reasons  we have not obtained contemporaneous externally prepared valuations by a third party valuation specialist 
we selected underwriters for our initial public offering in october and did not grant any stock options through february   the date of our initial public offering 
in january  we received offering price range indications from the underwriters that were derived using multiple valuation approaches  including the trailing twelve months ttm ebitda comparable company approach 
based upon our discussions with the underwriters  we believed that at the time the ttm ebitda comparable company approach was a more appropriate methodology for valuing our company and our common stock since we were in the process of offering our common stock to the public 
this market approach methodology is preferable to the income approach for a company pursuing a public offering because it relies on and uses data generated by actual public company performance and the resulting trading prices and is also less susceptible to the uncertainties of future projections 
as a result  in january we retrospectively reassessed the values of our common stock at the various option grant dates utilizing the ttm ebitda comparable company approach 
to retrospectively determine the value of our common stock  we calculated the ttm ebitda multiples of the companies that we and our underwriters determined to be our publicly traded comparables 
the comparable companies are alliance data systems  automatic data processing  bisys group  certegy  first data  global payments  ipayment  paychex  tns and total systems services 
we calculated the ttm ebitda multiples of each comparable company using data from these companies sec filings and other publicly available sources 
for each period  we used our comparable companies median ttm ebitda multiple and applied a marketability discount to determine the value of our common stock 
inherent in this methodology is the positive impact that any increase in the comparable companies median ttm ebitda multiple has on the value of our common stock 
increases in our common stock value as a result of any such changes in comparable company multiples is independent of our financial performance 
the marketability discount  or discount for lack of marketability  reflected our prospects for completing a public offering of our common stock  the risk or volatility of our enterprise and our concentration of ownership 
we decreased this discount each quarter throughout as our financial performance improved throughout the year and the prospects for an initial public offering for our company improved 
the following summarizes our grants of stock options during the year ended december  because the exercise price of all options granted during the period exceeded the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock  none of these grants resulted in the recognition of compensation expense 
exercise price per share of common stock reassessed weighted average fair value per share of common stock using ttm ebitda multiple number of shares subject to options first quarter second quarter n a n a n a third quarter fourth quarter n a n a n a total for the year ended december  
table of contents for a further discussion of our current stock valuation methods and treatment of stock based compensation see our discussions titled significant factors  assumptions and methodologies used in determining fair value of our common stock and recent accounting pronouncements in the sections below 
significant factors  assumptions and methodologies used in determining fair value of our common stock for the year ended december   our revenues and ebitda were million and million  respectively  excluding the pre acquisition results of brience  restructuring charges and impairment losses on intangible assets 
this represented a annual decline in revenues and a annual decline in ebitda from the year ended december  our company s declining performance was the result of a number of factors  including declines in revenues from several key customers including verizon wireless  competitive pricing pressures and the continued decline in revenues from our call processing services 
furthermore  wlnp had only recently been implemented in november and consumer adoption rates for this service were still uncertain 
at the end of  the wireless telecommunications industry also continued to suffer from financial difficulties  which curtailed demand for our new service offerings  increased pricing pressure on us and reduced our customers growth expectations 
in addition  at the end of  there was weak public market demand for wireless telecommunications services companies 
during the first nine months of  giving pro forma effect to the ios north america acquisition  our revenues and ebitda increased to million and million  respectively  excluding the pre acquisition results of brience  restructuring charges and impairment losses on intangible assets  or a and increase over the same period of the reasons for our improved financial performance include strong technology interoperability and network services transaction volume growth  an improving pricing environment for our services  the rapid growth of wlnp services and the successful acquisition of ios north america from eds 
furthermore  the improved financial position and market environment for our customers and the signing of several new international customers supported an improved outlook for our business 
during the fourth quarter of  our financial performance continued to significantly improve 
our revenues and ebitda increased during the quarter due to the completion of the ios acquisition  strong clearinghouse transaction processing volume growth and increases in network services messaging volumes 
in addition  we also signed domestic and international wi fi services contracts  including a contract with a major us carrier 
during the quarter  we also achieved a significant international expansion milestone by successfully signing our first major european clearinghouse contract 
by the end of  public markets for wireless telecommunications services companies also rebounded 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
this change in accounting replaces existing requirements 
the statement covers a wide range of equity based compensation arrangements and will require us to measure compensation cost for all share based payment including employee stock options at fair value 
sfas r will affect our financial statements beginning january  using one of two methods  the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
under sfas r  all forms of share based payments to employees  including employee stock options  will be treated the same as other forms of compensation by recognizing the related cost in the statement of operations 
the expense of the award payments will generally be measured at fair value at the grant date 
while the impact of the adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the levels of share based payments granted in the future  had syniverse adopted sfas r as of january  for options granted prior to or during the year ended december   the impact would have been immaterial to our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
share based payments granted prior to january   will be accounted for under sfas and the estimated financial impact to our consolidated results of operation in is immaterial 
these estimates assume no additional option grants or forfeitures 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments as of december   our contractual obligations consist only of our debt and operating leases 
we do not have a pension plan or other long term employee benefit plan 
our contracts with certain of our technology service providers  which range in length from months to months  have no minimum payment requirements 
contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years dollars in thousands long term debt obligations including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations total the interest rate on term note b is at libor plus  with libor assumed to be 
amounts represent primarily purchase obligations for equipment and services 
certain of these obligations represent fees that we would incur if we were to cancel or terminate the underlying purchase agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements we have also used off balance sheet financing in recent years primarily in the form of operating leases for facility space and some equipment leasing and we expect to continue these practices 
we do not use any other type of joint venture or special purpose entities that would create off balance sheet financing 
we believe that our decision to lease our office space is similar to that used by many other companies of our size

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our new senior credit facility 
our new senior credit facility is variable rate debt 
interest rate changes therefore generally do not affect the market value of such debt but do impact the amount of our interest payments and  therefore  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
on march   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding on our new senior credit facility 
holding other variables constant  including levels of indebtedness  a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable debt would have had an estimated impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next year of approximately million 
under the terms of the new senior credit facility at least of our funded debt must bear interest that is effectively fixed 
as a result  we may from time to time be required to enter into interest rate protection agreements establishing a fixed maximum interest rate with respect to a portion of our total indebtedness 

table of contents as of december  and  we had variable rate debt of approximately million million net of discount and million  respectively 
foreign currency market risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk in certain circumstances 
certain of our international clients currently pay us in euros and pounds sterling 
foreign currency fluctuations had an immaterial impact on our december  and financial positions and results of operations 
however  this could change in future periods 
at this time  we have not entered into any arrangements to hedge our risks from foreign currency
