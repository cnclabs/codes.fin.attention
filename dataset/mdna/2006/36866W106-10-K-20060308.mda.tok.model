gemstar businesses our businesses are organized into four groups that also represent our reportable business segments 
the segments are organized along three industry lines  in addition to a segment comprising certain corporate functions and related expenses 
publishing our publishing segment consists of tv guide magazine  tv guide online www 
tvguide 
com  and tv guide data solutions  a data collection and distribution business that gathers and distributes program listings and channel lineups 
in our publishing segment generated of our total revenue 
our publishing segment generates revenue primarily through subscription and newsstand sales of tv guide magazine and advertising revenue received by tv guide magazine and tv guide online 
in october  tv guide magazine debuted in a new full sized  full color format 
the reformatted tv guide magazine s content is centered on breaking tv related news  feature stories  tv celebrity photos  behind the scenes coverage and reviews and recommendations 
the first issues of the magazine  with a promotional cover price of  had average newsstand sales of approximately  per issue 
the sixth issue of the magazine  featuring nbc s medium and special d glasses  achieved newsstand sales of approximately  copies 
weekly total circulation for the first issues of the new full sized magazine averaged million  exceeding the magazine s advertising rate base of million copies by more than 
we believe the new full sized tv guide magazine is a better  more targeted product designed to yield higher subscription prices  increased newsstand sales and higher advertising cpms 
in november of we ceased publication of inside tv magazine 
inside tv  which was launched in april  was not performing as expected and we decided to focus our publishing unit s efforts and resources on the re launch of the full sized tv guide magazine 
in we incurred million in losses associated with the operations and shut down of inside tv 
cable and satellite our cable and satellite segment includes the operations of tv guide channel  tv guide interactive  tvg network  tv guide spot and tv guide mobile 
in the cable and satellite segment generated of our total revenue 
the cable and satellite segment generates revenue primarily from affiliate and advertising fees received by tv guide channel  licensing revenue received by tv guide interactive and wagering and licensing fees received by tvg network 
in the tv guide channel launched new series  delivered red carpet pre shows and produced and broadcast over specials 
this programming helped lead the channel to a increase in national primetime pm pm rating  as measured by nielsen  when compared to additionally  the tv guide channel s national primetime rating in the key adults ages demographic was up as compared to the prior year 
despite a relatively soft cable television advertising market  the tv guide channel increased advertising revenue by  as compared to as part of our strategy to provide tv guide channel viewers with compelling programming choices  we plan to continue to invest in new programming and marketing initiatives with an expectation that the additional investments will result in increased viewership and advertising revenue in the future 
as of december   tv guide interactive domestic cable and satellite subscribers that receive either our ipg or another party s ipg provided under a patent license for which we are paid increased by as compared to december  this increase was primarily a result of increased digital penetration among our major mso licensees and an increase in the number of directv subscribers for which we are paid 
the increase in domestic cable and satellite subscribers that receive either our ipg or another party s ipg provided under a patent license for which we are paid  does not necessarily exactly correlate to increases in our ipg licensing revenue  due to the terms of certain license agreements 
due to the fact that we have licensed our ipg technology to most major domestic cable and satellite providers  our future revenue growth will largely depend upon the overall growth in domestic digital cable and satellite subscribers 
in addition  penetrating international markets could provide an additional growth opportunity 

table of contents in  tvg network  our interactive cable and satellite television network focused on horseracing  processed approximately million in wagers 
this represents the highest yearly total in tvg network s history and a increase over the prior year 
we believe wagering volumes  will continue to increase as we continue to expand our distribution and customer base 
in the second quarter of  we launched tv guide spot  a new on demand service designed to entertain consumers while helping them navigate their ever expanding programming choices 
tv guide spot features short form  originally produced entertainment programs that guide consumers to the most compelling fare on tv each week 
tv guide spot is now available to approximately million comcast  insight and time warner digital cable subscribers 
tv guide spot is also available to broadband users on tvguide 
com and to tivo subscribers with stand alone set top boxes 
tv guide spot will also be available to cox communications and adelphia digital cable subscribers in in the fourth quarter of  we formed tv guide mobile entertainment  a new business unit focused on distributing our content and technology on mobile devices  including video enabled cell phones and personal digital assistants 
as part of this effort  in the fourth quarter of we announced the availability of tv guide mobile  a new television listings and content service for smartphones and windows mobile devices 
in  we intend to expand the distribution of tv guide mobile and other technology and content offerings to include mass market feature phones and video capable devices 
consumer electronics licensing our ce licensing segment earns revenue from licensing our proprietary technologies and services to the ce manufacturing industry 
in the ce licensing segment generated of our total revenue 
the ce licensing segment licenses video recording technology currently marketed under the vcr plus brand in north america and under other brands in europe and asia  and ipgs marketed under the g guide brand in japan  under the guide plus brand in europe and tv guide on screen brand in north america 
our ce ipg business continues to be strongest in japan 
in japan we are also seeing a transition for our ipg from primarily a recording feature in digital recorders to a guidance feature in digital television sets 
in  of the ce products incorporating our ipg launched in the japanese market were television sets 
we believe this transition will continue in in europe  ce products incorporating our ipg were released in all of these products were digital recorders  with products from sony and jvc entering the market for the first time 
in  we believe we will see the number of products in europe incorporating our ipg increase  as our ipg is integrated into a broader base of products with our key licensees 
in the north american market  ce products incorporating our ipg were released in the north american market differs from the japanese and european markets in that our ipg is being incorporated primarily in high end television sets as opposed to digital recorders 
of the products launched in  were high end television sets  which typically have lower sales volumes than lower priced devices 
on june  we entered into settlement  cross licensing and porting agreements with scientific atlanta  inc sa 
pursuant to those agreements  the parties resolved all outstanding litigation between them 
our vcr plus business continues to contribute a meaningful amount of revenue to the ce licensing segment 
the life of our vcr plus business has been extended by the incorporation of our vcr plus technology in certain mid to low end digital recorders 
as consumers continue to demand more advanced guidance and recording technologies  sales of ce products incorporating our vcr plus technology will likely continue to decline 
however  this trend will likely be offset by sales of ce products incorporating our ipg technology 
corporate our corporate segment comprises various centralized functions  including corporate management  corporate legal  corporate finance and other functions related to costs such as certain litigation and insurance costs 
for the year ended december   corporate expenses were million a decrease of million or as compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decline in corporate expenses was primarily due to a million decline in legal expenses 
skymall sale on december  we sold our skymall in flight catalog business to a private equity group for million in cash 
in addition  we retained approximately million of skymall liabilities and approximately million of skymall s cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
we recorded a pre tax gain of million in connection with the sale 
skymall was sold as it is not central to our strategy of focusing on building upon our core assets  including the tv guide brand  our guidance technology and our entertainment and editorial data and content

segment activities are discussed in greater detail in the segment results of operations  elsewhere in this md a 
for the year ended december   operating expenses  were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in legal expenses which was partially offset by a million increase in expenses at our cable and satellite segment

when these premises were vacated during the year ended december   we reserved million to provide for the estimated net present value of future lease obligations 
we paid the landlord million as a full settlement of all remaining lease obligations 
we recognized the reversal of the remaining reserve of million in operating expenses during the second quarter of this item is presented as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the same period in this decrease is primarily due to an impairment and change in useful lives of computer equipment and software which occurred in the third quarter of impairment of intangible assets impairment of intangible assets for the year ended december  was million 
it became apparent in  during the annual budgeting process  that we needed to reassess our outlook for the tv guide magazine business 
this triggered an interim assessment of the fair values of tv guide magazine s goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
with the assistance of a third party valuation expert  we estimated the fair values of these indefinite lived intangible assets as of september  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge representing the write off of million for goodwill and million for publishing rights and trademarks 
interest income expense  net for the year ended december   net interest income was million  an increase of million or  compared to the same period in this increase is due to the payoff of the tv guide credit facility on april   and higher prevailing interest rates 
other income  net for the year ended december   other income  net was million  a decrease of million compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily due to a million gain on the sale of our equity investment in youbet 
com  inc which occurred in legal and other loss contingencies a significant amount of management estimation is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingent matter and the amount of such accrual  if any 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
liabilities related to contingent matters at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
this decrease was due to the settlement of the litigation summarized below 
on january  and february   the california superior court for the county of los angeles and the united states district court for the central district of california  respectively  approved our agreement to settle i the derivative lawsuits consolidated in the california superior court for the county of los angeles as priebe  et al  v 
boylan  et al 

in re gemstar tv guide international derivative litigation  case no 
gc and ii a separate derivative lawsuit captioned knowles v 
yuen  et al 
in the united states district court for the central district of california  case no 
cv the settlement agreement provided for the implementation and or formalization of certain corporate governance provisions and a payment of attorneys fees by the company 
following approval of the settlement by both courts  the company made the million payment of attorneys fees to plaintiffs counsel 
in addition  on january  the company reached a settlement with the state of new jersey over its non consolidated securities litigation against the company 
shortly thereafter the company made the million payment required under the new jersey settlement agreement and the california superior court for the county of los angeles dismissed that case 
outside legal expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily due to a million and million decline in legal expenses at our ce and corporate segments  respectively 
the decline in legal expenses at our ce segment is due to reduced expenses for patent and antitrust litigation 
the decline in legal expenses at our corporate segment is primarily due to reduced legal expenses representing advancements to the company s former officers and directors 
we expect outside legal expenses to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future 

table of contents income taxes we have income both from foreign and domestic sources 
in the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating both our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the overall effective tax rate we report in any single period is impacted by  among other things  the country in which earnings or losses arise  applicable statutory tax rates and withholding tax requirements for particular countries  the availability of net operating loss carryforwards and the availability of tax credits for taxes paid in certain jurisdictions 
because of these factors  our current and future tax expense or benefit as a percentage of income or loss before income taxes may vary from period to period 
our effective tax benefit rate on loss from continuing operations before income taxes was for the year ended december  our effective tax benefit rate was primarily impacted by a decrease in the valuation allowance on deferred taxes and a benefit from the settlement of the internal revenue service the irs audit of the company s and federal income tax returns 
the decrease in the valuation allowance was primarily due to our ability to currently utilize or carry back capital losses  net operating losses and tax credits to prior years  thus no longer requiring a valuation allowance against such losses and credits 
this was partially offset by a valuation allowance on a portion of the deferred tax asset arising from the taxable income created by the advance payments received in the multi year patent and license distribution agreements with echostar and comcast  which were entered into in while these advances were received during  a substantial portion of these advances became taxable to us during our effective tax benefit rate on loss from continuing operations before income taxes was for the year ended december  as described more fully in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we determined that the fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets associated with tv guide magazine exceeded its carrying value 
the goodwill impairment write off is not deductible for tax purposes 
as a result  no tax benefit was recorded in relation to the impairment charge 
to the extent that we have deferred tax assets  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from taxable temporary differences  tax strategies or future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the future  we may adjust our estimates of the amount of valuation allowance needed and such adjustment would impact our provision for income taxes in the period of such change 
as of december  and  we have established valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  against our deferred tax assets 
assessment of the company s current tax exposure includes assessing tax strategies  the status of tax audits and open audit periods with the taxing authorities 
the irs is currently examining the company s us federal tax returns for years and the ultimate resolution of the company s current tax exposure items may result in the recognition of significant amounts of income or significant cash outlays in future periods 
we believe that adequate reserves have been made for any adjustment that might be assessed for open years 
discontinued operations on december  we sold our skymall in flight catalog business to a private equity group for million in cash 
in addition  we retained approximately million of skymall liabilities and approximately million of skymall s cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
we recorded a pre tax gain of million in connection with the sale 
in march  we entered into various agreements with echostar communications corporation and or certain of its subsidiaries echostar to sell substantially all of the operating assets of the superstar netlink group llc sng  uvtv distribution services  and spacecom systems spacecom businesses collectively  the sng businesses for approximately million in cash 
in addition  echostar agreed to assume certain liabilities 
the sng and uvtv distribution services sales closed on april  the spacecom sale closed on july  accordingly  the operations of the skymall business and the sng businesses  are shown as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial information

segment activities are discussed in greater detail in the segment results of operations  elsewhere in this md a 
for the year ended december   operating expenses  excluding the impact of the gemstar ebook lease settlement described below  were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the same period in the largest contributor to this decrease was a million or decline in legal settlement costs 
the decline in legal settlement costs was primarily due to the million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of relating to the consolidated shareholder class action settlement agreement 
the decrease in operating expenses was also due to million in costs incurred in the prior year to improve editorial content and enhance marketing efforts for tv guide magazine 
similar expenses were not incurred in additionally  there was an million reduction in expenses relating to our significantly scaled back gemstar ebook business 
lease settlement on june   we settled all obligations related to the premises previously occupied by our gemstar ebook operations 
when these premises were vacated during the year ended december   we reserved million to provide for the estimated net present value of future lease obligations 
we paid the landlord million as a full settlement of all remaining lease obligations 
we recognized the reversal of the remaining reserve of million in operating expenses during the second quarter of this item is presented as a separate line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents stock compensation stock compensation for consists of amortization of the portion of the purchase price of acquired businesses assigned to unearned compensation for unvested stock options we assumed in the acquisition of tv guide  inc tv guide and the fair value of restricted stock units awarded to certain members of our board of directors 
for the year ended december   stock compensation included million related to stock options held by dr 
yuen and ms 
leung 
as described more fully in note  we terminated the former executives employment for cause on april  in  the executives entered into employment agreements that provided for accelerated vesting of options granted in the period to  as well as an extended post employment exercise period to the remaining term of the options 
prior to the agreements  such options were only exercisable during the employment period with a limited post employment exercise period 
due to the extension of the post employment exercise period  a new measurement date occurred  at which time the intrinsic value of the modification was determined to be million 
the intrinsic value was computed as the difference between the exercise price per share and the stock price per share on the new measurement date multiplied by the number of options 
compensation expense was recognized only when we determined that these executives benefited from the extension of the post employment exercise period 
as a result of the termination  we recognized a pre tax stock compensation charge of million during the first quarter of in addition  stock compensation for the year ended december   included million recognized for amortization of unearned compensation related to unvested stock options we assumed in the acquisition of tv guide  and a net reversal of million related to previously amortized unearned compensation million recognized in the first quarter of and subsequently reversed in the second quarter of  and million recognized in 
the reversal related to restricted stock that was to be issued to dr 
yuen and ms 
leung in connection with the management restructuring in the fourth quarter of the previously recorded expense was reversed in the second quarter of  since these executives were terminated in april and the restricted stock will not be issued 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the same period in the substantial year over year reduction is due to decreased amortization expense related to certain finite lived intangible assets 
these finite lived intangible assets  which generated million of amortization expense for the year ended december   became fully amortized in july and therefore had no amortization in impairment of intangible assets impairment of intangible assets for the year ended december  was million 
it became apparent in  during the annual budgeting process  that we needed to reassess our outlook for the tv guide magazine business 
this triggered an interim assessment of the fair values of tv guide magazine s goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
with the assistance of a third party valuation expert  we estimated the fair values of these indefinite lived intangible assets as of september  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge representing the write off of million for goodwill and million for publishing rights and trademarks 
impairment of intangible assets for the year ended december  was million 
the impairment primarily included the write down of the carrying amount of goodwill at tv guide magazine million and the write down of tv guide magazine s publishing rights and trademark million 
these impairments were recorded as part of our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of october  the primary cause of these impairment charges was management s reassessment of the outlook for the magazine as compared to its forecasts and expectations in interest income expense  net for the year ended december   net interest income was million  compared to million of net interest expense for the same period in the change is attributable to a combination of the payoff of tv guide s credit facility on april   and interest income earned on our higher cash balances 
other income  net for the year ended december   other income  net was million  a million increase compared to the same period in the increase in other income  net was primarily due to a million gain on the sale of our equity investment in youbet 
com  inc during gains on sales of marketable securities for the year ended december  were million 

table of contents legal and other loss contingencies liabilities related to contingent matters at december  and december  were million and million  respectively 
the decline in accrued liabilities for contingent matters is primarily due to us paying million in connection with the consolidated shareholder class action settlement and million in connection with the sec settlement  which are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
outside legal expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes our effective tax benefit rate on loss from continuing operations before income taxes was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as described in impairment of intangible assets above  we recorded an impairment charge of million in to write off the remaining goodwill of tv guide magazine 
this impairment charge is not deductible for tax purposes 
in  we also reduced our deferred tax asset valuation allowance by million  primarily due to the tax effect of current year capital losses that will be carried back to offset prior year capital gains and increased our tax reserves by million 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december   was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance due to uncertainty of whether or not we will realize the benefit associated with our deferred tax assets and the non deductibility of goodwill impairment write offs 
discontinued operations for the year ended december   pre tax income from discontinued operations was million  an increase of million and compared to the same period of the increase is primarily due to million of impairment charges recorded in relating to the company s sng c band business that were not recorded in and a million increase in skymall s pre tax income 
the effect of the impairment charge was offset by the closing of the sng and uvtv businesses at the beginning of the second quarter and the closing of the spacecom sale early in the third quarter of additionally  a million pre tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations was recognized in connection with the sale of the sng businesses to echostar

adjusted ebitda is defined as operating loss  excluding stock compensation  depreciation and amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
we believe adjusted ebitda to be relevant and useful information as adjusted ebitda is the primary measure used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the industry segments 
publishing segment for the year ended december   revenues for this segment were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the same period in the following table shows the breakdown of revenues in the publishing segment by business unit in thousands year ended december  change dollars percent publishing segment tv guide magazine tv guide online other total in october tv guide magazine debuted in a new full sized  full color format 
the first issues of the magazine  with a promotional cover price of  had average newsstand sales of approximately  per issue 
the sixth issue of the magazine  featuring nbc s medium and special d glasses  achieved newsstand sales of approximately  copies 
the average newsstand sales for the first issues represented a gain over the average weekly digest newsstand sales number in the third quarter of it also represented a increase in newsstand sales over the comparable week period in in january  we increased our cover price to 
we believe this increase in cover price will increase our newsstand revenue  but will also result in a near term decline of approximately in average weekly newsstand unit sales  as compared to the first issues 
we believe single copy newsstand sales will then begin to increase  in part due to significant pocket growth throughout the year 
weekly circulation for the first issues of the new full sized magazine averaged million 
we expect circulation to decline to our million rate base during  due to a combination of cancellations and non renewals  as we focus on eliminating low and negative contribution subscribers 
paid ad pages in tv guide magazine  historically highest in the th quarter  declined significantly from the digest format tv guide 
a steep decline was anticipated as we shifted tv guide s focus as a vehicle for large circulation  low cpm advertisers towards a publication attractive to advertisers willing to pay a higher cpm for the enhanced format  improved circulation metrics  and a more 
table of contents focused and relevant demographic 
while the first issues of the reformatted tv guide magazine carried fewer ad pages  we did see an appreciable increase in average cpm when compared to the digest format primarily due to the enhanced format and improved circulation metrics 
nonetheless  advertising revenues for the first issues of the reformatted magazine were approximately million lower than the digest for a comparable period in the prior quarter 
for the first half of  we do not anticipate a meaningful increase in paid ad pages  as we establish ourselves with new advertisers and in new advertising categories 
we anticipate increased advertising revenue in the latter part of the year in conjunction with the roll out of the new fall television lineups 
our ability to maintain a higher cpm while increasing ad pages is critical to the full sized magazine s success 
for the year ended december   individually paid subscriber revenues declined by million as compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decline in individually paid subscriber revenue is the result of an aggressively priced subscription acquisition program for the digest format tv guide magazine in the first half of the year  which decreased subscription revenue per copy by  compared to for the digest format tv guide magazine we were focused on increasing our subscriber base through various heavily discounted promotional offers 
these deeply discounted subscriptions often take several years of increasing renewal rates to become profitable 
additionally  renewals from our higher contribution subscribers declined in compared to  we believe subscriber revenue in will decline significantly due to the planned reduction in our subscriber base 
however  our subscriber revenue per copy is expected to rise as we continue eliminating low and negative contribution subscribers 
for the year ended december   newsstand revenues decreased by million or  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
this decline was primarily due to a decrease in average weekly newsstand copies sold during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in additionally  the issues of the reformatted tv guide magazine were promotionally priced at vs 
for the digest 
this promotional pricing was done to drive sampling of the full sized tv guide magazine 
also contributing to this decrease was million in initial placement order ipo fees associated with the relaunch of tv guide magazine 
emerging issues task force issue no 
accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer requires certain consideration given by a vendor to a customer to be recorded as a reduction in revenue 
as a result  tv guide magazine revenues have been reported net of rack costs  retail display allowances  distribution fees and ipo fees 
ipo fees are initial fees paid to retailers for front end display pocket space at check out counters 
advertising revenues for the year ended december   decreased by million or  compared to the same period in this decline was a function of the continued erosion of the digest product  as well as the transition from the digest to full sized format announced in mid conventional advertising decreased by million  primarily in the pharmaceutical and packaged foods categories  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
pharmaceutical advertising has been negatively affected by the drug recalls in and negative publicity around direct to consumer marketing by these companies 
this has led some pharmaceutical companies to lower their marketplace profiles by reducing their consumer advertising activities 
additionally  program advertising revenues declined by million for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in spending by the major broadcast networks 
in  we anticipate that advertising revenue will decline significantly as the new full sized tv guide will have fewer ad pages and a lower rate base than the digest format 
we believe this volume decline will be partially offset by higher ad page yields due to increased cpm s 
taking into account severance costs  losses associated with the wind down of the digest product  and the conversion costs of the new format  we project that tv guide magazine operations excluding inside tv will incur aggregate operating losses of approximately million to million over the and fiscal years 
included in these losses are the anticipated costs of new rack acquisitions  consumer marketing and promotion programs 
for  we incurred approximately million in losses from tv guide magazine 
the actual amount and timing of these losses will depend upon a number of factors  including the rate of rack acquisition and the level of consumer and advertiser acceptance 
we believe the reformatted tv guide magazine will begin to contribute positively to the publishing segment s adjusted ebitda in the latter half of tv guide online derives revenues primarily from advertising 
for the year ended december   advertising revenues increased by million or  as compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to an increase in conventional advertising as conventional advertisers have focused more of their advertising spend on the internet and entertainment oriented websites 
although our ad revenue increased  our number of unique users has declined by as compared to the same period in the prior year 
in order to continue our ad revenue growth  we must increase our unique users 
we believe we can increase our unique users by expanding our content offerings and through better affiliate marketing 
in february our new search service was launched and we believe this service will increase our competitive position with consumers 
in addition  beginning in the fourth quarter of and continuing into  we are rolling out a program to increase search engine referrals to our site  thereby growing unique users 

table of contents other revenues for primarily include the operations of inside tv and tv guide data solutions 
in november of we ceased publication of inside tv magazine 
inside tv  which was launched in april  was not performing as well as expected and we have decided to focus our publishing unit s efforts and resources on the re launch of the full sized tv guide magazine 
in we incurred million in losses associated with the operations and shut down of inside tv 
operating expenses in this segment were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the same period in the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in expenses at tv guide magazine  partially offset by million in inside tv expenses 
the decrease in tv guide magazine expenses was primarily due to a million decrease in production costs  primarily due to a decrease in printed copies  and a million decrease in tv guide magazine operating costs 
in  we expect a significant reduction in tv guide magazine expenses  compared to  due to the reduction in printed copies and the overall reduction in operating costs associated with the reformatted tv guide magazine

this growth was due to a million increase in infomercial revenue and a million increase in national advertising revenue 
the increase in national advertising was driven primarily by increased cpms  due to stronger programming and the red carpet pre shows 
in  tv guide channel s primetime national household rating  as measured by nielsen  increased as compared to the prior year 
we believe our advertising revenues will continue to grow due to our efforts to increase ratings and viewership by continuing to improve the quality of our programming 
for the year ended december  carriage revenues decreased by million or 
future tv guide channel revenue growth will be largely dependent on our ability to grow advertising revenues  as the majority of our affiliates are contracted under long term agreements with only cost of living increases available under certain contracts 

table of contents for the year ended december   tv guide interactive s revenue increased by million or  when compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to a million or increase in licensing revenue due to an increase in the number of domestic cable and satellite subscribers that receive either our ipg or another party s ipg provided under a patent license for which we are paid 
due to the fact that we have licensed our ipg technology to most major domestic cable and satellite providers  future revenue growth for tv guide interactive will largely depend upon the overall growth in domestic digital cable and satellite subscribers 
in addition  penetrating international markets could provide another growth opportunity 
ipg advertising revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million or  as compared to the same period in this decrease is due to the mso that provided us with the majority of our advertising carriage in not carrying ipg advertising on the majority of its systems in our ability to provide ipg advertising is generally at the discretion of the msos and dbs providers if they deploy their own ipg or a third party ipg  which is the case for the majority of subscribers for which we are paid a license fee 
our ability to increase advertising revenue in future periods is largely dependent on the development of an ipg advertising platform that is accepted by msos and dbs providers  advertisers and consumers 
for the year ended december   tvg network  our interactive cable and satellite television network focused on horseracing  increased revenues by million or  as compared to the same period in this growth reflects increased wagering volumes for both our wagering operations and the wagering operations of our licensees 
our wagering operations and the wagering operations of our licensees have benefited from our continued growth in household distribution 
as of december   tvg network was available in approximately million domestic cable and satellite homes  an increase of as compared to december  additionally  tvg network is carried on fox sports net in approximately million southern california homes for two hours or more  five days a week 
operating expenses in this segment were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from the same period in the prior year 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to a million increase in programming and marketing costs associated with the red carpet events and other tv guide channel original programming  and a million increase in tv guide channel compensation costs  primarily due to severance and temporary compensation expense principally related to the new programming 
also contributing to the increase was a million increase in operating costs at tv guide interactive  primarily due to an increase in costs for the guideworks  llc joint venture  as well as million in costs associated with the launch and continuing operations of tv guide spot  for which there was no comparable cost in the prior year

table of contents the following table shows the breakdown of revenues in the ce licensing segment by product in thousands year ended december  change dollars percent ce licensing segment vcr plus ce ipg dbs other total our vcr plus business includes technology  marketed under the vcr plus brand in north america  the g code brand in asia and the video plus showview brand in europe  which is incorporated in ce products 
for the year ended december   revenues decreased by million or as compared to the same period in this decline is partially due to not recognizing revenue from a major ce manufacturer whose contract expired 
although this ce manufacturer has continued to ship units this year  it has not remitted payment to us nor provided us with a units shipped report 
while contract negotiations with this manufacturer are ongoing  there can be no assurance that a new agreement will be reached or on what terms 
the remainder of this decline is primarily due to a decline in units incorporating our vcr plus technology shipped by tier one manufacturers as well as a reduction in revenue due to the technology bundling deals discussed below 
the decline at these tier one ce manufacturers was partially offset by increased revenue from manufacturers of mid to low end digital recorders  including tier two manufacturers who had not previously licensed this technology 
in  we believe sales of ce products containing our vcr plus technology will continue to decrease and vcr plus revenues are likely to decrease due to this sales decline and the bundling deals discussed below 
additionally  we anticipate consumers will continue to demand more advanced guidance and recording technologies in digital devices as the cost of these technologies decreases 
while this will likely continue the decrease in demand for vcr plus  we believe this demand will increase our ce ipg revenues and offset the decrease in vcr plus revenues 
our ce ipg business includes i our ipg incorporated in ce products under the g guide brand in japan  guide plus brand in europe  and tv guide on screen brand in north america  and ii ipg patent licenses with third parties other than cable and satellite service providers 
for the year ended december   excluding million of settlements which occurred in  revenues based on the number of ce products shipped which incorporate our ipg technology increased by million or as compared to the same period in the prior year 
this increase was primarily driven by increases in revenues from the incorporation of our technology in ce products sold in japan and europe 
also contributing to the increase is revenue from sa set top box shipments  which did not occur in see below 
our ce ipg business continues to be strongest in japan  which is where we anticipate a large percentage of our revenue growth 
we also believe we will see revenue growth in from the incorporation of our ipg in products sold in europe 
the north american ipg market is dominated by dbs and mso provided ipgs 
while we believe in the long term prospects of the north american ce ipg market  the low take up rate for cable cards and the prevalence of alternative ipgs generally licensed by us and recognized in the cable and satellite segment means that growth in our north american ce ipg business will be slower to materialize 
also included in ce ipg revenue is the continued amortization of up front payments received under long term patent licenses  million for each of the years ended december  and on june   we entered into settlement  cross licensing and porting agreements with sa 
pursuant to those agreements  the parties resolved all outstanding litigation between them 
under these agreements  during a term of up to years commencing july   the parties are obligated to make various payments to each other 
the annual license fees due from sa to us will be calculated on a per unit basis based upon the number and type of products incorporating our technology and shipped by sa to its customers during the term  subject to annual minimum payments 
our annual license fee payments to sa will be fixed 
the minimum aggregate license fees that we are entitled to receive from sa during the term will equal approximately million 
the aggregate payments to be made by the company to sa during the term  based on the cross license and porting agreements  will be approximately million 
the actual amount and timing of the revenue that the company records under these agreements will depend upon the number and type of product shipments that sa reports during each year of the term 
ipg revenue above includes revenue related to sa units shipped in the third quarter  which were reported to us in the fourth quarter of in order to encourage the incorporation of our ipg in ce products  we offered certain large ce manufacturers the opportunity to bundle both our ipg and vcr plus technology at a significant discount beginning with sales reported in the first quarter of although in the near term combined ipg and vcr plus revenue has been reduced  we believe this will ultimately accelerate the incorporation of our ipg to our benefit 

table of contents as a result of our agreement with directv  dbs revenues are no longer collected from ce manufacturers of directv s set top boxes  but instead are paid by directv  and thus reported in our cable and satellite segment  on a recurring revenue model based initially on new subscribers 
as such  we no longer anticipate recognizing significant dbs revenues in the ce licensing segment 
additionally  revenues for year ended december  included million in settlements 
for the year ended december   operating expenses in this segment were million  a decrease of million or when compared to the same period in this decrease is largely due to a million decrease in the ce segment s legal expenses  primarily due to the sa settlement 
the decline in legal expenses was partially offset by a million increase in compensation costs  primarily due to million in severance costs 
corporate segment our corporate segment comprises various centralized functions  including corporate management  corporate legal  corporate finance and other functions and includes related costs such as certain litigation and insurance costs 
for the year ended december   corporate expenses were million a decrease of million or as compared to the same period in the prior year 
the decline in corporate expenses was primarily due to a million decline in corporate legal expenses  which was primarily due to a million decrease in legal expenses representing advancements to our former officers 
the company is a party to several significant pending legal proceedings  and various proceedings for which we are required to advance the legal fees and expenses incurred by our former officers remain unresolved 
accordingly  we expect legal expenses to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future 
in we believe corporate expenses will increase significantly as we pursue various strategic initiatives to better position ourselves as the leading consumer brand for video guidance across multiple platforms 
as with our business development and product development and technology groups costs  to the extent that these costs support company wide initiatives or to the extent that they are preliminary spend against an initiative that has not been assigned to a business segment  these costs will likely be included in operating expenses in our corporate segment

the absence of a comparable bad debt recovery in the current period was the primary contributor to this increase 
corporate segment for the year ended december   operating expenses in this segment were million a decrease of million  or  when compared to the same period in the decline in corporate expenses was principally due to a million decline in legal settlement costs in  primarily due to the million charge recorded in relating to the settlement of the consolidated shareholder class action and the sec investigation

our liability for prepaid magazine subscriptions is limited to the unearned payments in the event customers cancel their subscriptions 
our liability for other payments is limited to a refund of unearned payments in the event that we are unable to provide service 
no material refunds have been paid to date 
we anticipate reducing deferred revenues by approximately million to million in primarily from the recognition of deferred revenue 
included in the estimate above is a million to million reduction in tv guide magazine s deferred subscription revenues due to the planned decline of the paid subscriber base during for the year ended december   the company paid million in income taxes 
as a result of the completion of an irs examination of the company s federal income tax returns for the years and  the company is entitled to a tax refund of million plus interest 
additionally  the company filed another income tax refund request in the fourth quarter of for approximately million 
the full amount of these tax refunds are reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  the company received its million tax refund and approximately half of its million refund from the irs in the first quarter of the company anticipates receiving the balance of its million refund in the first half of the irs is currently examining our us federal tax returns for years and the results of this and future irs examinations may result in the recognition of significant amounts of income or significant cash outlays in future periods

the following is a summary of our future minimum payments under certain contractual obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital leases operating leases purchase obligations jv funding obligations total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying certain critical accounting policies 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimates could differ markedly from our current expectations 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition general we have followed the guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  since its effective date of december  and emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  since its effective date of june for revenue recognition  and analogize to the guidance in statement of position  software revenue recognition sop 
previously  we followed sop and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under this guidance  four conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized i there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 
license fees we license our proprietary technologies to ce manufacturers and to service providers  including msos and other owners and operators of cable television systems  telephone networks  internet service providers  internet web sites  direct to home broadcast satellite service providers  wireless systems and other multi channel video programming distributors 
it is our normal practice to enter into written agreements with our customers 
we generally recognize such license fees based on a per unit shipped model with consumer electronics manufacturers or a per subscriber model with service providers 
our revenues from per unit license fees are recognized in the period the manufacturers report the number of units shipped 
revenues from per subscriber fees are recognized in the period services are provided by a licensee  as reported to us by the licensee 
under certain agreements  manufacturers prepay license fees for a guaranteed minimum number of unit shipments over a specified period 
revenues are recognized when the manufacturers report the number of units shipped 
if any portion of the prepayment remains to be recognized as revenue at the end of the period  it is recorded as revenue in the final month of the period 
fees for shipments in excess of the minimum are recognized in the period the manufacturers report the units shipped 
see multiple element arrangements below 
revenues from annual and other license fees generally are recognized based on the specific terms of the license agreements 
for instance  we entered into certain arrangements under which substantial flat fees were paid upfront in addition to ongoing per unit license fees 
in such cases  the prepaid fees were deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
in certain cases  we will license our technology for an unlimited number of units over a specified period of time during which we have continuing obligations 
we record the fees associated with these arrangements on a straight line basis over the specified term 
in addition  we have licensing arrangements with msos under which we share a portion of the ipg advertising revenue that we generate through the mso 
in some cases  we guarantee that a substantial portion of the mso s license fees paid to us will be reimbursed to the mso through our ad sharing obligation 
to the extent the ad sharing fees are not sufficient to meet these guarantees  we are obligated to purchase advertising on the mso s platform 
because the license fee is not fixed or determinable until resolution of the sharing or advertising buyback  which is typically settled quarterly  the advertising buyback guarantees and advertising revenue sharing are netted against the license fees so that only a net license fee amount is recognized 
from time to time  the license agreement between a licensee and us may expire 
while a new license agreement is being negotiated  the licensee may continue to ship the same units or the same services may continue to be deployed containing our patented or proprietary technologies and the licensee may continue to report units shipped or subscriber information on a periodic basis 
license and subscriber fees may continue to be received at the old contract rates and on a timely basis 
in such cases  we continue to recognize license and subscriber fee revenue 
however  revenue is not recognized when collection is not reasonably assured and in no case when payment is not received for greater than days 
multiple element arrangements in accounting for multiple element arrangements  one of the key judgments to be made is the accounting value that is attributable to the different contractual elements 
the appropriate allocation of value not only impacts which segment is credited with the revenue  it also impacts the amount and timing of revenue recorded in the consolidated statement of operations during a given period due to the differing methods of recognizing revenue by each of the segments  as discussed above 
revenue is allocated to each element based on the accounting determination of the relative fair value of that element to the aggregate fair value of all elements 
the fair values must be reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable 
when available  such determination is based principally on the pricing of similar cash arrangements with unrelated parties that are not part of a multiple element arrangement 
when sufficient evidence of the fair values of the individual elements does not exist  revenue is not allocated among them until that evidence exists 
instead  the revenue is recognized as earned using revenue recognition principles applicable to 
table of contents the entire arrangement as if it were a single element arrangement 
at this time  in all instances where ipg advertising has been part of a multiple element transaction  no revenue has been allocated to ipg advertising for accounting purposes  and all revenue has been allocated to other elements of the transaction 
for accounting purposes  we expect to record ipg advertising associated with multiple element arrangements in this manner until such time as we conclude that we can determine the fair value of ipg advertising in a reliable  verifiable and objective manner 
impairment of long lived assets  long lived assets to be disposed of and intangible assets we review our long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends or if future performance is below historical trends 
we periodically review intangible assets and goodwill for impairment using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we have a significant amount of property and equipment and intangible assets 
the determination as to whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable involves management s judgment 
in addition  should we conclude that recoverability of an asset is in question  the estimate of undiscounted future operating cash flows is used to determine whether an asset is recoverable and  if not  the final determination of the fair value of the asset is also based on the judgment of management 
these judgments can be impacted by a variety of underlying assumptions  such as the general business climate  effectiveness of competition and supply and cost of resources 
accordingly  actual results can differ significantly from the assumptions made by management in making its estimates 
future changes in management s estimates could result in indicators of impairment and actual impairment charges where none exist as of the date of this report 
accounting standards  which became effective january   eliminated the impairment recoverability tests for certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives and require that such assets be valued at the lower of their carrying value or fair value 
goodwill is no longer amortized but remains subject to an annual impairment test performed at the reporting unit level 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
absent any interim evidence of impairments  we will perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles for all reporting units on october of each year 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance  if necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
we have income both from foreign and domestic sources 
the company s tax structure is complex 
in the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating both our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
assessment of our actual current tax exposure includes assessing tax strategies  the status of tax audits and open audit periods with the taxing authorities 
the ultimate resolution of our current tax exposure items may result in the recognition of significant amounts of income or significant cash outlays in future periods 
to the extent that we have deferred tax assets  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from taxable temporary differences  tax strategies or future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december  and  we have established valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  against our deferred tax assets 
in the future  we may adjust our estimates of the amount of valuation allowance needed and such adjustment would impact our provision for income taxes in the period of such change 

table of contents legal and other loss contingencies a significant amount of management estimation is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingent matter and the amount of such accrual  if any 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
as of december  and  we had accrued million and million  respectively  for contingent matters 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have significant amounts due to us from our customers 
we continuously evaluate our outstanding accounts receivable for collectibility 
this evaluation involves management s judgment in assessing the aging of the amounts due to us and in reviewing the credit worthiness of each customer 
should a customer s financial condition deteriorate in a manner that could decrease the customer s ability to pay amounts due to us  we might be required to provide additional allowance for doubtful accounts  which would reduce our earnings

certain risks affecting business  operating results and financial condition this section highlights some specific risks affecting our business  operating results and financial condition 
the list of risks is not intended to be exhaustive and the order in which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight or importance 
we face risks arising from the transformation of our tv guide magazine publishing business 
over the past several years  the operating results of our magazine publishing business have deteriorated due to significant declines in tv guide magazine s newsstand sales  contribution per copy  and advertising revenue 
we sought to reverse such declines through a variety of different initiatives  including editorial changes and aggressive promotional offerings 
however  those efforts were unsuccessful 
consequently  during the fourth quarter of we transformed our tv guide magazine from a digest sized  listings oriented format to a more contemporary full sized  full color magazine  filled with more features and photos and targeted at a younger demographic 
however  several other widely circulated magazines and other media outlets seek to appeal to this market segment and there can be no assurance that the transformed magazine will appeal to or be accepted by this market segment or the advertisers who seek to reach it 
a business initiative of this scale is inherently risky and there can be no assurance that our assumptions are valid or that our circulation goals can be achieved 
additionally  the cost of transforming the magazine will be substantial  and that should this effort fail  the cost of pursuing other alternatives will be significant 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in transforming the magazine or that the transformed magazine or our magazine publishing business will achieve profitability 

table of contents we face risks arising from our tv guide channel strategy 
revenues at tv guide channel consist of affiliate fees and advertising revenues  however  since the majority of our affiliates are contracted under long term agreements with only cost of living increases available under certain contracts  we do not expect significant growth in affiliate revenues in the future 
accordingly  the results at tv guide channel are highly dependent upon advertising revenue 
advertising revenue at the tv guide channel is primarily dependent on the extent of distribution of the network  viewership ratings  such as those published by nielsen  and continuing advertising strength in the marketplace 
while tv guide channel has benefited  to a certain degree  from the expanded distribution that we have achieved  a significant portion of the expanded distribution has been to dbs subscribers  who did not previously have tv guide channel as a programming choice 
digital cable and dbs homes also have many more channels and generally use an ipg for listing information 
as such  the viewership of tv guide channel in digital cable and dbs homes has been minimal to date 
we have been investing in new programming and marketing initiatives at the tv guide channel with an expectation that the additional investments that we are making in programming and marketing will  in the future  result in increased viewership in both cable and dbs homes 
if our viewership ratings do not improve sufficiently or we are unable to maintain broad distribution of the tv guide channel  our increased programming and marketing costs could have a material adverse effect on our cable and satellite segment results of operations 
also  certain of the long term agreements with msos for the tv guide channel allow for the migration to exclusively digital carriage 
if the mso elects to migrate tv guide channel earlier than we currently expect  the company will experience a significant reduction of tv guide channel subscribers resulting in reduced license fee revenue and potentially reduced advertising revenue 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing our programming and marketing initiatives  or that such initiatives will result in increased viewership ratings and advertising revenues for tv guide channel or that any initial increase in viewership ratings will be sustainable over time 
tv guide spot may be unsuccessful and may adversely affect our results 
we recently launched tv guide spot  an on demand  cross platform network featuring originally produced sponsored  short form video entertainment programs that provide television guidance 
the success of the network is largely dependent on factors such as the extent of distribution of the network as well as market and advertiser acceptance of sponsored short form on demand entertainment 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our initiative or that such initiatives will generate significant revenues or ultimately be profitable 
the market for interactive program guides may not expand rapidly 
the market for ipgs is rapidly evolving and is increasingly competitive 
demand and market acceptance for ipgs are subject to uncertainty and risk 
we cannot predict whether  or how fast  this market will grow  how long it can be sustained  or how it may expand or change 
for our ce ipgs  the deployment rate depends on the strength or weakness of the consumer electronics industry  and in particular  the sale of television sets  dvd recorders and dvrs 
purchases of ce products and digital cable and dbs subscriptions are largely discretionary and may be affected by general economic trends in the countries or regions in which these products or subscriptions are offered 
for tv guide interactive  which is deployed primarily through domestic digital set top boxes  due to the fact that we have licensed our ipg technology to most major domestic cable and satellite providers  our future revenue growth will largely depend upon the overall growth in domestic digital cable and satellite subscribers 
if the market for our ipgs  and those of our licensees  develops slowly or becomes saturated with competitors  our operating results could be adversely impacted 
the market for ipg advertising may not develop 
our ability to provide ipg advertising is at the discretion of the mso and dbs providers who have entered into license agreements to deploy their own ipg or a third party ipg 
our ability to increase the revenues that we derive from the sale of advertising on ipgs distributed by our cable and satellite licensees will depend on the implementation of ipg advertising by such licensees  as well as on increased acceptance of ipg advertising by consumers and advertisers 
the market for ipg advertising is at an early stage of development and we cannot assure you that we will succeed in our efforts to develop ipg advertising as a widely accepted advertising medium 
the mso that provided us with the majority of our advertising carriage in is no longer carrying ipg advertising on the majority of its systems 
our business may be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for consumer electronics devices incorporating our technologies 
we derive significant revenues from manufacturer license fees for our vcr plus and ce ipg technologies based on the number of units shipped 
we do not manufacture hardware  but rather depend on the cooperation of ce manufacturers to incorporate our technology into their products 
generally  our license agreements do not require manufacturers to include our technology in any specific number or percentage of units  and only a few of these agreements guarantee a minimum aggregate licensing fee 
demand for 
table of contents new ce devices  including television sets  integrated satellite receiver decoders  dvrs  dvd recorders  personal computers and internet appliances  may be adversely impacted by increasing market saturation  durability of products in the marketplace  new competing products and alternate consumer entertainment options 
as a result  our future operating results may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in sales of ce devices employing our technologies 
vcr plus revenues have declined over time and may decline further due to full penetration of the product in a declining market 
the worldwide shipment of vcrs has  and is expected to continue to decline as vcrs are replaced by digital recording devices such as dvd recorders and dvrs 
although vcr plus is now being incorporated into some lower price point digital recording devices  there is no assurance that this practice will become widespread or continue 
furthermore  in order to encourage the incorporation of our ipg in ce products  we are offering certain large ce manufacturers the opportunity to bundle both our ipg and vcr plus technology at a significant discount beginning with sales reported in fiscal we anticipate this could lead to a decrease in combined ipg and vcr plus revenues in fiscal while we believe this will ultimately accelerate the incorporation of our ipg to our benefit  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our existing vcr plus agreements as they expire  upon terms as favorable to us as those contained in prior contracts  or at all 
we face competition in many areas and the competition could negatively impact our operating results 
we face competition from a wide range of other companies in the communications  advertising  media  entertainment  publishing  information  internet services  software and technology fields 
the competitive environment could  among other results  require price reductions for our products and services  require increased spending on marketing and development  limit our ability to develop new products and services  limit our ability to acquire rights to produce and or display content that is popular among our targeted audience  limit our ability to expand our customer base or even result in attrition in our customer base 
any of these occurrences could negatively impact our operating results 
many of our competitors have greater financial and human resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors can compete more effectively by offering customers better pricing and other more favorable terms and conditions 
our ipgs face competition from companies that produce and market program guides as well as television schedule information in a variety of formats  both print and electronic 
several products and services on the market offer simplified vcr programming functions that compete with our vcr plus system 
tv guide magazine competes with general entertainment and other magazines at newsstand and for subscribers 
the tv guide channel competes with general entertainment channels for television viewership and carriage on cable and dbs systems 
tv guide online competes with general entertainment web sites for visitors and will compete with established online search providers 
each of tv guide magazine  tv guide channel and tv guide online vie for marketers advertising spend with other media outlets 
tvg network competes for viewers with other television networks  one of which is under common ownership with several racetracks and accepts wagers from residents of more states than tvg network accepts 
in addition  tvg network and its licensees compete for wagering revenue with other account wagering operations and industry participants 
new products and services  rapid technological change and changes in consumer demand may adversely affect our operations 
the emergence of new consumer entertainment products  services and technologies  changes in consumer preferences and other factors may limit the life cycle of our products  services and technologies and any future products  services or technologies we might develop 
although we believe that we will continue to develop attractive new products and services  the industries in which we operate are characterized by rapid changes  including technological changes and changes in consumer demand 
our future operations could be adversely impacted by our ability to identify emerging trends in our markets and to develop and market new products and services that respond to competitive offerings  technological changes and changing consumer preferences in a timely manner and at competitive costs 
our investments in developing new products and services  improving existing products and services  and enhancing infrastructure may not be effective 
we have recently established a new product group to enhance the company s product development efforts 
the process of developing and marketing new products and services is inherently complex and uncertain  and there are a number of risks  including the following we cannot assure you that the level of funding and significant resources we are committing for investments in new products  services  technologies and initiatives will be sufficient or result in successful new products  services or technologies  
table of contents we cannot assure you that we can anticipate successfully the new products  services and technologies which will gain the market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues  we cannot assure you that our newly developed products  services or technologies can be successfully protected as proprietary intellectual property rights or will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others  and our products  services and technologies may become obsolete due to rapid advancements in technology and changes in consumer preferences 
furthermore  we have made significant investments in the development of new products  services and technologies  such as our initiatives to transform tv guide magazine  enhance tv guide channel s programming  launch tv guide spot  create tv guide mobile and other digital media initiatives  and increase and enhance the functionality of our interactive products  but the success of such products  services and technologies is largely dependent on factors such as market acceptance 
furthermore  the success of tv guide channel  tv guide spot and tv guide mobile will depend  in part  upon our ability to enter into and maintain agreements with third parties to distribute these services to consumers 
our failure to anticipate adequately changes in the industries in which we operate and the markets we serve  and to develop attractive new products and services  including any of the risks described above  may reduce our future growth and profitability and may adversely affect our business results and financial condition 
additionally  we have made and expect to make significant investments in infrastructure  tools  systems  technologies and content  including initiatives relating to digital asset and rights management and data warehouses  aimed to create  assist in the development or operation of  or enhance our ability to deliver  innovative guidance products and services across multiple media  digital and emerging platforms 
these investments may ultimately cost more than is anticipated  their implementation may take longer than expected and they may not meaningfully contribute to or result in successful new or enhanced products  services or technologies 
we are also investing in integrated financial  contract management and reporting systems  aimed to support our current and future businesses  as well as to enhance our operational and corporate infrastructure 
these additional infrastructure investments may ultimately cost more than is anticipated  their implementation may take longer than we expect or they may otherwise fail to meet our needs and expectations 
any infringement by us or some of our licensees on patent rights of others could affect the development of our products and services or result in litigation 
patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer some of our products and services 
many of our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained  and may be expected to obtain in the future  patents that concern products or services related to the types of products and services we plan to offer 
we may not be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services 
in addition  in the united states  patent applications are generally confidential for a period of months from the filing date  or until a patent is issued in some cases  so we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications prior to their publication 
if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents held by others  we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services  to obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patent claims 
we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others and whether the licenses would be available or  if available  whether we would be able to obtain the licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
if we were unable to obtain the licenses  we might not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement 
furthermore  we provide indemnification protection to some of our ce ipg licensees and to some of our mso and dbs provider licensees under which we may be obligated to indemnify those licensees and hold them harmless from some claims  including claims that our or their products or services infringe other parties patents 
during the second quarter of  the company received notice of such indemnification claims from one of its licensees 
the costs of investigating  defending or remedying alleged infringement could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
some terms of our agreements with licensees could be interpreted in a manner that could adversely affect licensing revenue payable to us under those agreements 
some of our agreements with ce manufacturers  cable and satellite service providers and other licensees contain most favored nation clauses 
these clauses typically provide that if we enter into an agreement with another licensee on more favorable terms  we must offer some of those terms to our existing licensee 
we have entered into a number of license agreements with terms that differ in some respects from those contained in other agreements 
these agreements may obligate us to provide different terms to licensees  
table of contents which could  if applied  result in lower revenues or otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
while we believe that we have appropriately accounted for the most favored nation terms included in our license agreements  these contracts are complex and other parties could reach a different conclusion that  if correct  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
dependence on the cooperation of msos and dbs providers  television broadcasters  hardware manufacturers  publications  data providers and delivery mechanisms could adversely affect our revenues 
we rely on third party providers to deliver our ce ipg data to ce devices that include our ce ipg 
further  our national data network provides customized and localized listings to our ipg service for msos and dbs providers and licensees of our data used in third party ipgs for msos and dbs providers 
there can be no assurance that these delivery mechanisms will distribute the data without error or that the agreements that govern some of these relationships can be maintained on favorable economic terms 
to deliver our ce ipg data to ce devices  we have arrangements to carry our data in a part of the television signal called the vertical blanking interval vbi or its digital signal equivalent  of television stations included in the public broadcasting network  independently owned stations  and stations owned and operated by various station group owners 
our contract related to the public broadcasting network stations covers substantially all of the territory required to be covered to effectively transmit our data for delivery to ce devices incorporating our ce ipgs in the united states 
we nevertheless continue to rely on arrangements  which are not long term  with station group owners and operators and independently owned stations for vbi carriage of our ipg data 
we cannot assure you that our carriage arrangements with station group owners and operators and independently owned stations will continue 
our data broadcast through the vbi can be  and has been in the past in some markets  deleted or modified by some of the local service providers 
widespread deletion or modification of this data by service providers could have a material adverse impact on our ce ipg business 
to mitigate this risk  we have entered into agreements with many service providers to ensure that our ce ipg data will not be deleted or modified by such systems 
generally  we deliver our data to our ipg service for msos and dbs providers and to licensees of our data used in third party ipgs for msos and dbs providers via satellite transmission 
currently  we rely on a single third party who provides us with satellite capacity to transmit our data to our ipg service for msos and dbs providers and to licensees of our data used in third party ipgs for msos and dbs providers 
our arrangement with the third party provider may be terminated on little or no notice 
in the event that such provider elects not to transmit our data  our business  operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected 
to mitigate this risk  we have built in certain redundancies in our data delivery operation to allow for transmission of our data via an alternative satellite and via the internet 
however  in the event that this provider of satellite capacity elects not to provide this capacity to transmit our data  there can be no assurance that all of our customers who currently receive our data via this provider will be able to receive our data via alternative means without significant delay or additional cost to us 
furthermore  in order for consumer electronics devices that incorporate our ce ipgs to receive our data  such data must also be able to pass through any receivers through which such devices are receiving television programming signals 
we do not currently deliver our ce ipg data over satellite networks 
even if our ce ipg data is passed to cable subscribers through cable networks by the service providers  there is a risk that the cable set top boxes deployed by such subscribers can impede the passage of our ce ipg data 
additionally  cable companies are progressively moving their systems from an analog format to a digital format  which poses certain problems to our data carriage 
solving such problems will require the cooperation of third parties such as the msos and dbs providers  television broadcasters and hardware manufacturers  and may also require additional investment by the company 
widespread impedance of our ce ipg data could have a material adverse impact on our ce ipg business 
in addition  we purchase some of our program guide information from commercial vendors 
the quality  accuracy and timeliness of that data may not continue to meet our standards or be acceptable to consumers 
our vcr plus system relies on consumer access to pluscode numbers through licensed publications 
we depend on the maintenance and renewal of agreements governing the pluscode publications to ensure the distribution of the pluscodes 
interruption or failure of communications and transmission systems and mechanisms could impair our abilities to effectively provide our products and services  which could affect our revenues 
the provision of certain of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of communications and transmission systems and mechanisms  including satellite  cable  wire  over the air broadcast communications and transmission systems and mechanisms 
these communication and transmission systems and mechanisms are subject to significant risks and any damage to or failure of these systems and mechanisms could result in an interruption of the provision of our products and services 
interruptions in the provision of our products and services could adversely affect our revenues  and our brand could be damaged if people believe our 
table of contents products and services are unreliable 
the communications and transmission systems and mechanisms that we depend on are vulnerable to damage or interruption from telecommunications and satellite failures  natural disasters  terrorists attacks  power loss  computer viruses and similar events 
the communications and transmission systems and mechanisms that we depend on are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities 
limitations on control of joint ventures 
the company holds its interests in certain businesses  including guideworks and interactive program guide  inc  as a joint venture or in partnership with nonaffiliated third parties 
as a result of such arrangements  the company may be unable to control the operations  strategies and financial decisions of such joint venture or partnership entities which could in turn result in limitations on the company s ability to implement strategies that the company may favor  or to cause dividends or distributions to be paid 
in addition  the company s ability to transfer its interests in businesses owned with third parties is limited under certain joint venture  partnership or similar agreements 
seasonality and variability of consumer electronics product shipments and newsstand sales of our print products may affect our revenues and results of operations on a quarterly or annual basis 
shipments of ce products tend to be higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters 
we recognize revenues associated with our technology incorporated in these ce products when the shipments are reported to us  which is normally the quarter immediately following that of actual shipment by the licensee 
general advertising also tends to be higher in the fourth quarter 
in addition  manufacturer shipments vary from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including retail inventory levels and retail promotional activities 
newsstand sales of our print products tend to be higher in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
as a result  we may experience variability in our licensing and advertising revenues 
paper and postal price increases can materially raise our costs associated with the production and delivery of tv guide magazine 
the price of paper can be a significant factor affecting tv guide magazine s operating performance 
we do not hedge against increases in paper costs 
paper prices may increase and if we cannot pass these costs on to our customers  the increases may have a material adverse effect on us 
postage for product distribution  billings  renewals  and direct mail solicitations is also a significant  uncontrollable expense to us 
digital recapture could adversely affect carriage of our analog products and services 
cable television is transmitted on a limited frequency spectrum that must be allocated between multiple analog and digital channels 
as digital penetration increases  msos are reclaiming analog bandwidth to launch more digital networks and interactive television services  and are likely to continue this recapture until they rebuild their plants to increase bandwidth or there is stability in the mix of analog and digital carriage 
if this trend continues  digital recapture may result in a significant decline in the distribution of our analog tv guide channel  which could negatively impact our operating results 
the gaming activities of tvg network are extensively regulated 
tvg network derives a substantial portion of its revenue from pari mutuel wagering  which is subject to extensive statutory and regulatory oversight 
additionally  tvg network s internet based horse race wagering operations are heavily regulated 
adverse changes in the political climate  new legislation or regulatory activity could harm our business 
from time to time  the california horse racing board has considered various proposals that  if enacted  would detrimentally impact the revenue that tvg derives from the california market or otherwise adversely impact tvg s business model 
from time to time  members of congress and state legislatures have introduced bills that would prohibit or severely restrict off track interstate pari mutuel or internet based wagering 
at this time  there is a risk that new legislation or regulatory activity that would prohibit internet based wagering will be pursued in order to rectify possible nonconformity by the united states with the general agreement on trade in services treaty as recently determined by an appellate body of the world trade organization 
in addition  from time to time  payment systems have  on behalf of their member financial institutions  taken actions to limit the use of credit cards and debit cards for non face to face gaming transactions as a means of combating illegal internet based gambling operations 
although such efforts to restrict payment mechanisms may not be targeted at the lawful activity of licensed operations such as tvg network  the resulting inconvenience to our customers caused by such measures could harm our business or growth prospects 

table of contents continued consolidation of the cable and satellite broadcasting industry could adversely affect existing agreements  the impact of these changes is not clear 
we have entered into agreements with a large number of cable msos and dbs providers for the licensing or distribution of our technology  products and services 
if  as expected  consolidation of the cable and satellite broadcasting industry continues  some of these agreements may be affected by mergers  acquisitions or system swaps 
we cannot assure you that any measures that we have taken to protect us against any negative consequences resulting from those transactions will be effective 
also  a service provider that files a bankruptcy petition or otherwise restructures or liquidates could avoid its future obligations and discharge its past payment obligations under the agreement in some circumstances 
any such events could have a material adverse effect on the amount of revenue we receive under these agreements 
we face risks related to the ongoing sec enforcement action  securities litigation and doj investigation involving certain of our former executives 
although we have settled with the sec regarding its investigation of the company and we have settled most of the related shareholder and securities litigation filed against the company  some of our former officers and directors have been named as defendants in certain of these matters 
the plaintiff class in the purported class action captioned in re gemstar tv guide international securities litigation  case no 
cv mrp plax has retained all of its securities fraud claims against our former ceo and former cfo 
in addition  although three of the former officers and directors of the company who were named defendants in the pending sec civil action completed settlements with the sec  and one other former officer has reportedly reached a proposed settlement with the los angeles office of the sec subject to final approval from the sec and the court  the sec recently completed a trial against the company s former ceo 
further  a proposed plea bargain agreement with our former ceo and the department of justice doj  which had also been conducting an investigation into allegations raised against some of the company s former officers and directors in the sec investigation and the related shareholder lawsuits  was recently rejected by a us district court judge 
the company is generally obligated  to the extent permitted by law  to indemnify our former directors and officers who are named defendants in some of these lawsuits and investigations 
in addition  we are generally obligated  to the extent permitted by law  to advance legal defense costs and expenses incurred by those individuals 
our ability to anticipate the timing and amount of those costs and expenses that will be submitted to us for advancement is limited  however  those amounts have been significant and may continue to be significant until these matters are fully resolved 
in addition  the timing of the final resolution of these proceedings is uncertain 
the possible resolutions of these proceedings could include judgments or settlements against our indemnities that could require substantial payments by us  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
unfavorable outcomes in legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 
our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation and the protection and validity of our patents and other intellectual property rights 
our patents and other intellectual property rights are important competitive tools and many generate income under license agreements 
we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the united states or abroad 
unfavorable rulings in our legal proceedings  including those described in note  litigation and other contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements  may have a negative impact on us that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings 
in addition  we are currently  and from time to time in the future may be  subject to various other claims  investigations  legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties 
if the results of these investigations  proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against third party lawsuits  we may be required to pay monetary damages or may be subject to fines  penalties  injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a third party lawsuit or counterclaim  we may have to devote significant financial and management resources to address these issues  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
government regulations may adversely affect our business 
the satellite transmission  cable and telecommunications industries are subject to pervasive federal regulation  including fcc licensing and other requirements 
these industries are also often subject to extensive regulation by local and state authorities 
while these regulations do not apply directly to us  they affect cable television providers and other multichannel video programming distributors mvpds  which are the primary customers for our products and services 
in march  the fcc extended to july  a deadline under which mvpds except dbs providers must phase out consumer electronic navigation devices eg  set top boxes with combined security and non security functions 
the fcc has indicated that it may eliminate this separation requirement altogether if the cable and consumer electronics industries successfully negotiate a bi directional plug and play agreement  which 
table of contents would allow interactive services to be provided on digital televisions without the need for a set top box 
a plug and play agreement could affect demand for ipgs incorporated into set top boxes or consumer electronics devices  such as tv guide interactive and our ce ipgs 
future developments relating to any of these or other regulatory matters may adversely affect our business 
our stock price has been volatile 
the market price of our common stock has historically been volatile 
it is likely that the market price of our common stock will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations 
we believe that future announcements concerning us  our competitors or our principal customers  including technological innovations  new product and service introductions  governmental regulations  litigation or changes in earnings estimated by us or analysts may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially in the future 
sales of substantial amounts of outstanding common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
further  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price fluctuations in equity securities of technology and media companies 
these price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as armed hostilities  acts of terrorism  civil disturbances  recessions  international currency fluctuations  or tariffs and other trade barriers  may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
although we recently implemented a disaster recovery program  a disaster could nevertheless damage our operations 
we recently implemented a disaster recovery or business continuity program as part of a phased implementation of a more comprehensive and responsive recovery capability 
while the new plan provides recoverability and a utility for our critical operations  the system is not yet comprehensive as it relates to all of our production  publishing and transmission operations 
in the event of a catastrophic disruption  there remain some single points of failure or delays in timely recovery of or within our processes and technology that would cause us to lose  or cause an undue delay in  our ability to provide transmission or publishing capabilities 
in that event  we would have to operate at reduced service levels that could have a material adverse affect on our relationships with our customers  our revenue generation and our brand 
news corporation s interests may diverge from those of other stockholders and the company 
news corporation has significant influence over our business because of its beneficial ownership of our common stock and the number of its executives who serve on our board of directors 
there can be no assurance that its interests are aligned with that of our other stockholders 
investor interests can differ from each other and from other corporate interests and it is possible that this significant stockholder with a stake in corporate management may have interests that differ from those of other stockholders and of the company itself 
if news corporation were to sell  or otherwise transfer  all or a large percentage of its holdings  our stock price could decline and we could find it difficult to raise capital  if needed  through the sale of additional equity securities 
in addition  this concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control over us at a premium over the then current market price of our common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest a majority of our excess cash in money market funds maintained with several high credit quality financial institutions 
we also invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in fair value due to changes in interest rates
