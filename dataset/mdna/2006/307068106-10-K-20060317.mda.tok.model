recognition of franchise related revenue initial franchise revenue is recognized when we have performed substantially all of our obligations as franchisor 
franchise royalties are recognized when earned as promulgated by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for franchise fee revenue 
our franchise revenue consists of area development fees  initial franchise fees  and continuing royalty payments 
our area development fee consists of a non refundable payment to secure the territory equal to  per restaurant upon the signing of the area development agreement 
since the fee is non refundable to secure the territory  we recognize this fee upon receipt 
our initial franchise fee is typically  per restaurant  of which  is recognized immediately when a franchise agreement is signed  reflecting the commission earned and expenses incurred  as related to the sale of the franchise 
the remaining  is included in deferred franchise fees and is recognized as revenue  when a franchisee has secured a site  meaning a lease has been executed or a property purchase agreement has been signed  at which time we have substantially performed all of our services and we have no further obligations related to the site selection 
franchisees are also required to pay us a monthly royalty equal to a percentage of their net sales  which has historically varied from to 
currently  new franchises pay us a royalty of of their net sales 
franchise related revenue for fiscal was approximately million  a increase compared to franchise related revenue of approximately million for the same period in fiscal  primarily reflecting increased royalties 
royalties  which are based on a percent of franchise operated restaurant net sales  increased  reflecting the annualization of franchise restaurants that opened in fiscal in addition to the franchise operated restaurants that opened during fiscal during fiscal  franchised operated restaurants opened  and closed 
there were franchise operated restaurants open at january   compared to at january  an additional franchise restaurants are anticipated to open throughout fiscal asset impairment and restructuring charges in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate restaurant sites and long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of restaurant sites to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the restaurant site to the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
if a restaurant is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the restaurant site exceeds its fair value 
fair value as determined by the undiscounted future net cash flows  is estimated based on the best information available including estimated future cash flows  expected growth rates in comparable restaurant sales  remaining lease terms and other factors 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to take additional impairment charges for the related assets 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate future cash flows 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
restaurant sites that are operating but have been previously impaired are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
our january  and 
table of contents january  consolidated balance sheets reflect approximately million of assets held for sale  representing the land and building for a location that was closed in december we had several offers for this location during fiscal that were not consummated  but we believe the land and building are properly valued 
during fiscal and fiscal  there were no impairment or restructuring charges recorded 
in fiscal  we recorded impairment and restructuring charges of approximately million related to five company owned restaurants  two of which were subsequently closed  two of which were subsequently sold to franchisees  and one that was fully impaired  but still operating 
deferred tax asset deferred taxes recognize the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded for financial statement purposes and such amounts measured in accordance with tax laws 
realization of net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax temporary differences are contingent on future taxable earnings 
during fiscal  our deferred tax asset was reviewed for expected utilization using a more likely than not approach as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  by assessing the available positive and negative evidence surrounding its recoverability 
we believe that the realization of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not based on the fact that the company generated taxable income in fiscal and and based on the expectation that we will generate the necessary taxable income in future years 
lease accounting in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for leases  we recognize lease expense for our operating leases over the entire lease term including lease renewal options and build out periods where the renewal is certain and the build out period takes place prior to the restaurant opening or lease commencement date 
we account for construction allowances by recording a receivable when its collectibility is considered certain  depreciating the leasehold improvements over the lesser of their useful lives or the full term of the lease  including renewal options and build out periods  amortizing the construction allowance as a credit to rent expense over the full term of the lease  including renewal options and build out periods  and relieving the receivable once the cash is obtained from the landlord for the construction allowance 
results of operations revenue our revenue consists of restaurant sales  franchise related revenue  and licensing and other revenue 
our franchise related revenue is comprised of area development fees  initial franchise fees  and continuing royalty payments 
our area development fee to secure the territory consists of a non refundable payment equal to  per restaurant upon the signing of the area development agreement 
since the fee is non refundable  we recognize this fee upon receipt 
our initial franchise fee is typically  per restaurant  of which  is recognized immediately when a franchise agreement is signed  reflecting the commission earned and the expenses incurred  as related to the sale 
the remaining  is recognized upon either the signing of a lease or the signing of a property purchase agreement  and at which time we have substantially performed all of our services 
franchise royalties are equal to a percentage of net franchise operated restaurant sales  currently at to 
licensing revenue includes royalties from a retail line of business  including sauces  seasonings  rubs and marinades 
other revenue includes opening assistance and training we provide to our franchise partners 
costs and expenses associated with these services are included in general and administrative expense 
comparable sales represent net sales for restaurants open year round for months or more 
costs and expenses restaurant costs and expenses include food and beverage costs  operating payroll and employee benefits  occupancy costs  repair and maintenance costs  supplies  advertising and promotion  and restaurant depreciation and amortization 
certain of these costs and expenses are variable and will increase or decrease with sales volume 
the primary fixed costs are corporate and restaurant management salaries and occupancy costs 
our experience is that when a new restaurant opens  it incurs higher than normal levels of labor and food costs until operations stabilize  usually during the first three 
table of contents months of operation 
as restaurant management and staff gain experience following a restaurant s opening  labor scheduling  food cost management and operating expense control are improved to levels similar to those at our more established restaurants 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that provide an infrastructure to support existing operations and support future growth 
salaries  employee benefits  legal fees  accounting fees  consulting fees  travel  rent and general insurance are major items in this category

restaurant sales restaurant sales were approximately million for fiscal year and fiscal year the rd week of fiscal contributed approximately million in sales 
fiscal sales results reflect the two week closure of our maple grove  minnesota location during the third quarter of for its conversion from counter service to full service  which negatively impacted fiscal sales by approximately  these were offset by increased comparable sales growth  primarily from an increase in our catering and to go business  and the impact of weighted average price increases during fiscal equal to less than 
our category leadership in off premise sales continues to strengthen  as catering and to go accounted for approximately of sales in  compared with approximately of sales in fiscal franchise related revenue franchise related revenue consists of royalty revenue and franchise fees  which include initial franchise fees and area development fees 
franchise related revenue for fiscal was approximately million  a increase when compared to franchise related revenue of approximately million for the same period in  primarily reflecting increased royalties 
royalties  which are based on a percent of franchise operated restaurants net sales  increased reflecting the annualization of franchise restaurants that opened in fiscal in addition to the net new franchise restaurants opened during fiscal fiscal included  franchise operating weeks  compared to  franchise operating weeks in  representing an increase of approximately 
there were franchise operated restaurants open at january   compared to at january  licensing and other revenue licensing revenue includes royalties from a retail line of business  including sauces  rubs  marinades and seasonings 
other revenue includes opening assistance and training we provide to our franchise partners 
for fiscal year  the licensing royalty income was approximately  compared to approximately  for fiscal year during fiscal  we expect to see licensing revenue increase moderately compared to levels 
other revenue for fiscal was  compared to  in the amount of other revenue has grown based on the level of opening assistance we provided during for the opening of new franchise restaurants 
the amount of other revenue is expected to grow based on the level of opening assistance we expect to provide during the franchise openings planned for same store net sales it is our policy to include in our same store net sales base  restaurants that are open year round and have been open for at least months 
at the end of fiscal and fiscal  there were restaurants included in this base 
same store net sales for fiscal increased approximately  compared to fiscal s increase of approximately as calculated assuming fiscal was a week year 
we believe that the increase in same store net sales reflects the combination of our advertising initiatives  the success of our lto s  weighted average price increases of less than and a focus on operational excellence and execution in our restaurants 
same store net sales for franchise operated restaurants for fiscal decreased approximately  compared to a decrease of approximately for the prior year comparable period 
for and  there were and restaurants  respectively  included in franchise operated comparable sales 

table of contents average weekly net sales the following table shows company owned and franchise operated average weekly net sales for fiscal and fiscal twelve months ended january  january  company owned full service counter service franchise operated food and beverage costs food and beverage costs for fiscal were approximately million or of net restaurant sales compared to approximately million or of net restaurant sales for fiscal results reflect the impact of weighted average price increases of less than implemented during fiscal  in addition to our ability to leverage our menu and offset higher food costs through usage of our lto s 
as a percentage of dine in sales  our adult beverage sales at our company owned restaurants are approximately 
building the bar continues to be a focus for us  however  we have determined that we are limited in our ability to grow the bar in the majority of our locations due to the fact that these locations have little to no designated bar  and some restaurants only have beer and wine 
we re encouraged by the prospects of growing this business on a go forward basis  however  because our recent franchise openings have achieved rates in the mid teens for their adult beverage sales as a percentage of dine in sales 
approximately of our purchases are on contract 
our annual pork contract renewal in october resulted in an approximate price decrease for  our poultry contract pricing remained relatively flat to prior year and our brisket contract gets renewed in the spring 
we anticipate that food costs  as a percent of net restaurant sales  will be slightly favorable for over the prior year 
we believe that we have an opportunity to mitigate the negative impact  if any  that any food contract pricing may have on our margin through menu engineering such as with the use of our lto s which typically carry more margin than many of our core product offerings 
we will continue to take price increases as appropriate  and leverage adult beverage sales  which typically have higher margin 
labor and benefits labor and benefits at the restaurant level were approximately million or of net restaurant sales in fiscal compared to approximately million or of net restaurant sales in fiscal the decrease in labor and benefits reflects favorable medical claims experience and labor productivity  partially off set by a higher level of bonus payout at the restaurant level 
full service restaurants that operate in states without a tip credit such as minnesota experience a higher wage rate for dining room labor than do restaurants located in states where a tip credit is available to reduce wages paid to food servers 
the migration toward full service dining in the majority of our restaurants is part of our strategy for increasing unit level revenue  but may result in higher labor costs 
during fiscal  we are expecting labor and benefits as a percentage of net restaurant sales to remain relatively flat to fiscal operating expenses operating expenses for fiscal were approximately million or of net restaurant sales  compared to approximately million or of net restaurant sales for fiscal the increase in fiscal restaurant level operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales is primarily due to increased supplies expense from catering and to go sales  increased utilities costs  as well as increased advertising costs 
during fiscal  operating expenses as a percentage of net restaurant sales are expected to increase slightly from the percentage in fiscal  primarily due to higher utility costs  higher advertising costs  and higher supplies costs related to increases in catering and to go  partially offset by further leveraging of fixed costs 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for fiscal was approximately million  or of total revenue  compared to approximately million  or of total revenue for fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percent of total revenue in compared to is primarily due to better leveraging of these costs

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses totaled approximately million or of total revenue in fiscal compared to approximately million or of total revenue in fiscal in fiscal  general and administrative expenses included  in stock based compensation expense and  in franchise service expense 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses included  in stock based compensation expense and  in franchise service expense 
excluding stock based compensation expense and the impact of our franchise services  which is offset in other revenue  the percentage was for and for the comparable period in the remaining increase in the percentages primarily reflects planned investments in infrastructure in anticipation of our growth 
during  we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat as a percentage of total revenue  resulting from the increased cost related to a third year in our performance share program  options expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment  in the first quarter of fiscal and the services we expect to provide to the expected franchise operated restaurant openings 
interest expense interest expense totaled approximately million or of total revenue for fiscal  essentially equal to fiscal s interest expense in terms of dollars and as a percentage of total revenue 
this line item represents interest expense from capital lease obligations  notes payable  financing lease obligations and a company match for deferrals made under our non qualified deferred compensation plan 
for fiscal  we expect interest expense to remain relatively flat to fiscal levels 
interest income interest income was approximately  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
interest income reflects interest received on short term cash and cash equivalent balances 
fiscal interest income was lower than fiscal due to lower cash balances 
we expect fiscal interest income to remain relatively flat to fiscal levels 
other income expense  net during fiscal  we realized other income  net  of approximately  which compares to other expense  net  of approximately  in fiscal other income in fiscal primarily reflects a gain on the condemnation of a small percentage of land at one of our company owned restaurants 
the other expense in is due to a write off of a restaurant s remaining assets subsequent to the sale to a franchise

realization of the net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax timing differences is contingent on future taxable earnings 
our deferred tax asset was reviewed for expected utilization using a more likely than not approach as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  by assessing the available positive and negative evidence surrounding the recoverability of the deferred tax asset 
we believe that the realization of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not based on the fact that we generated taxable income in fiscal and and based on the expectation that our company will generate the necessary taxable income in future years 
utilization of federal net operating losses will be achieved through offsetting tax liabilities generated through earnings  increased by payments of current taxes to state authorities
