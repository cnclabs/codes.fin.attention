the company also earns revenue from the movement of freight within the continental united states by truck when such movement complements its core business of moving freight to and from puerto rico 
the company s operating expenses consist of the cost of the equipment  labor  facilities  fuel and administrative support necessary to move freight to and from puerto rico and within the continental united states 
the company s improvement in operating income and the resulting operating ratio during are primarily due to significant reductions in rent expense on vessels and equipment  partially offset by the related increase in depreciation expense and interest expense  which result from the assets purchased in the transaction completed in december  in addition to an increase in revenue primarily resulting from increased rates in the puerto rico trade lane in which the company operates

vessel capacity utilization on the core continental us to puerto rico traffic lane was during  compared to during southbound trailer and container volume remained relatively stable but vessel capacity utilization decreased due to a decrease in the auto and other cargo volume southbound 
the company will monitor the auto and other cargo market and make adjustments as necessary to best utilize its vessel capacity 
domestic line haul revenue is generated for moves that originate and terminate within the continental united states 
the decrease in domestic line haul revenue was primarily the result of less domestic linehaul within the continental united states  as our land based revenue equipment was reallocated to service the primary continental united states to puerto rico lane

vessels the company owns five tbcs and two roros 
the company s regular liner service between san juan  puerto rico and jacksonville  florida includes two of the tbcs and the roros 
management continues to evaluate the use of the three vessels not currently used in the liner service and no determination has been made as to their final use 
as an alternative to their current use management has used one vessel as a ready spare  relieving the other vessels in the fleet during periods dry docking in order to protect market share and keep established shipping routes open  and has chartered the other vessels on a short term basis to third parties 
ultimately management intends to use all of these vessels in its current liner service or on expanded trade routes 
it is the management s belief that based on the current cash flows derived from the tbc vessels and their current market value as determined by an independent appraiser  that the current excess capacity of the two vessels  available for charter  does not indicate an impairment

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of certain accounting policies  many of which requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in these financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
management believes the application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  management has found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies are described below 
revenue recognition 
voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period  commonly referred to as the percentage of completion method 
voyage expenses are recognized as incurred 
demurrage and charterhire revenue are included in our revenues 
demurrage is a charge assessed for failure to return empty freight equipment on time 
charter hire is rental revenue for vessels not in use in a liner service 
the company recognizes demurrage and charterhire revenue based on negotiated fees included in the contracts of our customers 
these amounts are computed daily and included in operating revenue 
useful life and salvage values 
the company reviews the selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating our property and equipment 
depreciable lives of property and equipment range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sales are based on the expected values of equipment at the time of disposal 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in a period and ultimately  the gain or losses on the disposal of the asset 
for instance  the company recognized a loss of  in and a gain of  in on the disposal of assets 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the carrying amounts and periods over which long lived assets are depreciated to determine if events have occurred which would require modification to our carrying values or useful lives 
in evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long lived assets  the company reviews certain indicators of potential impairment  such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows  replacement costs of such assets  business plans and overall market conditions 
the company determines undiscounted projected net operating cash flows and compares it to the carrying value 
in the event that impairment occurred  the company would determine the fair value of the related asset and record a charge to operations calculated by comparing the asset s carrying value to the estimated fair value 
the company estimates fair value primarily through the use of third party valuations 
in  the company page recorded an impairment charge on our triplestack box carriers r barges amounting to approximately million 
the company recognized no impairments in  or in the fourth quarter of  the company had an appraisal performed on these vessels 
the results of this appraisal listed the fair market value of these vessels to be in excess of their book value 
uncollectible accounts 
the company records a monthly provision based on specific known collectibility problems  historical losses  and current economic information 
in addition  the company performs an analysis of the total receivables on a quarterly basis  and adjusts the provision account to the calculated balance 
it is our policy to write off receivables once it is determined that additional efforts of collection will not result in the receipt of the receivable 
during the years ended december   and the company provided   and  respectively for uncollectible accounts 
the company records this expense in other operating expenses 
the trade receivable balances during the corresponding period were million  million and million for  and respectively 
the trade receivable balance decrease in of 
was due to better collection efforts in however  the year end balance for the allowance account increased by  and  for the years ended december  and  due to the mix of outstanding receivables 
income taxes 
income taxes are calculated using the liability method specified by sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management continues to evaluate the deferred tax valuation allowance  to determine what portion  if any of the deferred tax asset that may be realized in the future 
management s evaluation includes  among other things  such factors as a consistent history of profitability  a substantial history of operations upon which to base a forecast and a history of accurately forecasting future results of operations 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with less management judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result
