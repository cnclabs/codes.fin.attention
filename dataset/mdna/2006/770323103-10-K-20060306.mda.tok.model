risk factors 
because long term contracts are not a significant part of the company s business  future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results 
critical accounting policies and estimates as described below  the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments 
accounts receivable allowances 
the company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
estimates used in determining the accounts receivable allowances were based on current trends and historical loss statistics 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may materially affect the company s future financial results 
income tax assets and liabilities 
in establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts 
the likelihood of a material change in the company s expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks  final us and foreign tax settlements  and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions 
while management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding deferred income tax assets and liabilities are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the company 
employee retirement plans 
the determination of the company s obligations for its defined benefit retirement agreement for the company s chief executive officer is dependent upon various assumptions  including  among others  expected retirement age  mortality  expected post retirement consumer price index increases  and discount rates 
management believes its assumptions are appropriate  however  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company s future financial results 
goodwill impairment 
the company assesses the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management 
the company s estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect the future financial results of the company 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended december  and  and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required 
workers compensation 
the company self insures or retains a portion of the exposure for losses related to workers compensation 
the company has established reserves for workers compensation claims based on historical loss statistics and periodic third party actuarial valuations 
while management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the company s future financial results 
stock option plans 
the company has a long history of issuing stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of its compensation programs 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow alternative methods of accounting for these plans 
the company has chosen to account for its stock option plans under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under apb  the intrinsic value of the options is used to record compensation expense and  as a result  no compensation expense related to stock options is included in determining net income and net income per share in the financial statements 
restricted stock and stock unit grants are accounted for in accordance with apb apb mandates that restricted stock grants with performance conditions are calculated using the intrinsic value 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  calculations of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share  computed in accordance with the method prescribed by sfas no 
 share based payment sfas  are set forth in note a to the financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the emerging issues task force eitf issued issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements eitf  which requires that leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of a lease term be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewal periods that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased 
the adoption of eitf during the three months ended september  did not have an impact on the company s financial statements 
in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the company adopted the provisions of fin in the three months ended december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
apb opinion no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
the provisions in sfas are effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  the company will adopt sfas effective january  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
during december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which revises sfas and supersedes apb sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as expense based on their fair values 
in april  the sec amended the effective date of sfas r to be the first annual period beginning after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to expense recognition 
under sfas r  the company will be required to select a valuation technique  or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard 
allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the black scholes model 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas r in the first quarter of the company is in the process of assessing the impact on the company s results of operations from the adoption of sfas r for its effect on prospective option grants 
the adoption of sfas r requires the company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of sfas r under the fair value method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock option s remaining vesting period 
this will result in the company expensing approximately million  before income tax effects  in that would previously have been presented in a pro forma footnote disclosure 
in addition  sfas r will require the company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow  which will impact the company s future reported cash flow from operating activities 
in march  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab to give guidance on the implementation of sfas r 
the company will consider sab during implementation of sfas r

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the company s foreign subsidiaries 
exchange rates impact the us dollar value of the company s reported earnings  investments in its foreign subsidiaries  and the intercompany transactions with its foreign subsidiaries 
for the year ended december   approximately of the company s revenues were generated outside of the united states 
these operations transact business in their functional currency 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar have an impact on the company s reported results 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
consequently  as the value of the us dollar changes relative to the currencies of the company s non us markets  the company s reported results vary 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of the company s stockholders equity 
the assets and liabilities of the company s non us subsidiaries are translated into non us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
