item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview privatebancorp was organized as a delaware corporation in to serve as the holding company for a chicago based de novo bank 
we currently have banking offices  a mortgage company and an interest in lodestar  an asset manager 
our flagship downtown chicago location opened in we expanded to wilmette in north suburban cook county in and oak brook in west suburban dupage county in we established the st 
charles office in the fox valley in january  in connection with our purchase of towne square financial corporation a company which was in the process of forming a de novo bank in august in february  we consummated our acquisition of johnson bank illinois adding two additional locations in lake forest and winnetka  illinois 
on june   privatebancorp capitalized the privatebank st 
louis 
in may  the privatebank chicago opened a second office in the fox valley area in geneva  illinois 
in december  the privatebank chicago acquired an controlling interest in lodestar  a chicago based investment adviser with million of assets under management at december  lodestar is a subsidiary of the privatebank chicago 
on june   the company formed a new subsidiary  the privatebank mortgage company  as a result of the acquisition of corley financial corporation  a chicago based mortgage banking firm 
on january   the company opened a new chicago banking office in chicago s gold coast neighborhood 
the privatebank wisconsin opened its permanent space at n 
water street in downtown milwaukee in september on june   the company completed its acquisition of bloomfield hills bancorp  inc  including its bank subsidiary  the private bank  now known as the privatebank michigan  and a mortgage banking subsidiary 
the privatebank michigan has three banking offices located in the suburban detroit communities of bloomfield hills  grosse pointe  and rochester 
the privatebank michigan also operates a trust and wealth management unit and a mortgage banking subsidiary 
during and early  we entered into three new leases for larger office space for established offices in oak brook and geneva  illinois and for a new office in chesterfield  missouri  which is scheduled to open in temporary space in march and in a permanent location during the second quarter the chicago headquarters will relocate to w 
madison during the third quarter we completed our initial public offering in june of since year end to december   we have grown our asset base at a compounded annual rate of to billion 
during the same period  loans have grown at a compounded annual rate of to billion  deposits at a compounded annual rate of to billion and core deposits at a compounded annual rate of to billion 
wealth management assets under management grew at a compounded annual rate of to billion 
diluted earnings per share eps have grown at a compounded annual rate of to split adjusted since year end excluding loans acquired from the privatebank michigan  loans grew at a compounded annual rate of from year end to december  excluding deposits acquired from the privatebank michigan  deposits grew at a compounded annual rate of from year end to december  excluding wealth management assets acquired from the privatebank michigan  wealth management assets grew at a compounded annual rate of from year end to december  for financial information regarding our four separate lines of business  the privatebank chicago  the privatebank st 
louis  the privatebank michigan  wealth management services and holding company activities  see operating segments results beginning on page and note operating segments to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included on page f the profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income  provision for loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts and 
table of contents yields of interest earning assets as compared to the amounts and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan losses is affected by changes in the loan portfolio  management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio  loss experience  as well as economic and market factors 
non interest income consists primarily of wealth management fee revenue  mortgage banking income  bank owned life insurance and to a lesser extent  fees for ancillary banking services 
net securities gains and net gains on an interest rate swap are also included in non interest income 
non interest income from fees and deposit service charges are below peer group levels 
this is largely the result of the profile of our typical client 
our clients tend to have larger deposit account balances than customers of traditional banks 
because average balances tend to be high  we do not earn high service charge income typical of many retail banks 
non interest expenses are heavily influenced by the growth of operations 
our growth directly affects the majority of our expense categories 
our largest expense categories are salaries and benefits  occupancy expense net and professional fees 
critical accounting policies generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting  reporting and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions and estimates to apply these principles where actual measurements are not possible or practical 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
reference should also be made to our significant accounting policies set out in the notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
changes in such estimates may have a significant impact on the financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has reviewed the application of these policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
for privatebancorp  inc  accounting policies that are viewed as critical to us are those relating to estimates and judgments regarding the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the estimation of the valuation of goodwill and the useful lives applied to intangible assets 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based on a review of available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
our allowance for loan losses is reassessed quarterly to determine the appropriate level of the allowance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is determined based on a variety of factors  including assessment of the credit risk of the loans in the portfolio  evaluation of watch list loans  volume of loans in the portfolio  delinquent loans  impaired loans  evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area  actual charge offs and recoveries during the period and historical loss experience 
the unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations  including management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 

table of contents management adjusts the allowance for loan losses by recording a provision for loan losses in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance at the level determined appropriate 
loans are charged off when deemed to be uncollectible by management 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was as of december   compared to at december  goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be separately distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset  or liability 
the company performs an annual goodwill impairment test in accordance with fas  which requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives no longer be amortized but be reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
prior to the adoption of fas no 
 goodwill was being amortized using the straight line method over a period of years 
impairment losses on recorded goodwill  if any  will be recorded as operating expenses 
goodwill is pushed down to business segments at acquisition 
fair values of reporting units are determined using either discounted cash flow analyses based on internal financial forecasts or  if available  market based valuation multiples for comparable businesses 
no impairment was identified as a result of the testing performed during or note o contains additional information regarding goodwill and the carrying values by segment 
customer intangibles acquired in connection with the acquisition of lodestar are amortized over an estimated useful life of years 
customer intangibles acquired in connection with the acquisition of the privatebank michigan will be amortized over years using an accelerated method of amortization 

table of contents consolidated results of operations net income our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   and million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our diluted earnings per share increased as compared to earnings per share  and as compared to earnings per share 
the increase in net income for compared to is primarily attributable to increases in interest earning assets and growth in fee income  mainly from increases in wealth management revenue 
the acquisition of the privatebank michigan was accretive in  including the consideration of all transaction costs 
our income growth was offset by growth in non interest expense  evidenced by our efficiency ratio remaining at at december   even with the prior year period 
the increase in net income for compared to is primarily attributable to growth in the balance sheet  particularly increases in loans  which were funded by growth in deposits and stabilization of our net interest margin 
increased fee income  mainly from increases in wealth management revenue  also contributed to the improvement in net income during net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets and interest expense and amortization of fees on deposits and borrowings 
interest income includes amortization of loan origination fees recorded from loans 
interest expense includes amortization of prepaid fees on brokered deposits and issuance costs of trust preferred securities 
net interest margin represents the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets during the period 
net interest margin reflects the spread between average yields earned on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
the volume of non interest bearing funds  largely comprised of demand deposits and capital  also affects the net interest margin 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase of 
net interest income is affected by both the volume of assets and liabilities held and the corresponding rates earned and paid 
the increase in net interest income for is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets 
average earning assets for were billion compared to billion for  an increase of 
our net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was for the year ended december  compared to for the prior year 
during  increased volumes of interest earning assets at higher rates were offset by increased interest rates on liabilities 
our cost of funds was greater during than  compared to  respectively  and our earning assets yielded in compared to in non interest bearing funds impact net interest margin since they represent non interest bearing sources of funds that are deployed in interest bearing assets 
non interest bearing funds positively impacted net interest margin by at december  and by at december  during  our net interest margin was impacted by increases in the costs of our average interest bearing liabilities throughout the year 
during  total cost of funds increased by basis points from  as a result of volume increases and increases in wholesale funding costs  time 
table of contents deposit rates  and increased interest expense related to the million of trust preferred securities issued on june  in connection with the privatebank michigan acquisition 
the basis point increase in our cost of funds was partially offset by improvements in our yield on earnings assets  which increased by basis points during the year due primarily to increased loan volumes and increases in the prime rate  which increased basis points over the course of the year 
margin was also compressed because of reduced dividends on our investment in fhlb chicago stock 
the company s annualized yield on this investment was in compared to for during  dividends received on our investment in fhlb chicago stock represented million  or  of our interest income on a tax equivalent basis  for the year  compared to for the prior year 
we expect our net interest margin to remain stable or improve slightly if market interest rates increase relative to levels 
alternatively  if market interest rates decrease  we expect our net interest margin to experience pressure 
approximately of the loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate of interest or otherwise adjusts with other short term interest rates 
the rising interest rate environment that we experienced in increased the impact of our non interest bearing funds on our overall net interest margin and also offset the decline in net interest spread on a year over year basis 
during  increased volumes of interest earning assets at higher rates were offset by increased interest rates on liabilities 
our cost of funds was greater during than  compared to  respectively  and our earning assets yielded in compared to in non interest bearing funds impact net interest margin since they represent non interest bearing sources of funds that are deployed in interest bearing assets 
non interest bearing funds positively impacted net interest margin by at december  and by at december  during  our net interest margin was impacted by increases in the costs of our average interest bearing liabilities throughout the year 
we lengthened the maturity of funding sources  with a resulting increase in our cost of funds 
the increase in cost of funds was primarily due to increases in money market deposit rates  some of which are tied to prime  as well as higher rates paid on short term borrowings and fhlb advances 
the increase in our cost of funds was partially offset by improvements in our yield on earnings assets  which were positively impacted by the increases in the prime rate of interest 
the rising interest rate environment that we experienced in increased the impact of our non interest bearing funds on our overall net interest margin and also offset the decline in net interest spread on a year over year basis 
a changing interest rate environment has an effect on our net interest margin 
approximately of the loan portfolio is indexed to the prime rate of interest or otherwise adjusts with other short term interest rates and may reprice faster than our deposits and floating rate borrowings 
currently  the interest rate yield curve is inverted which means that shorter term rates are higher than certain long term rates 
an inverted yield curve has the effect of compressing net interest margin as shorter term funding sources become more expensive and longer term assets experience declining yields 
we expect to renew our maturing funding sources at higher rates than what we are currently recognizing 
over the long term  we expect our net interest margin to benefit during a rising interest rate environment and alternatively  if market interest rates decrease  we expect our net interest margin to decrease

the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses  which is charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses  is determined based on a variety of factors  including assessment of the credit risk of the portfolio  evaluation of loans classified as special mention  sub standard and doubtful loans  delinquent loans  evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area  actual charge offs during the year  historical loss experience and industry loss averages 
the unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations  including management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is supported by available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships  as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
management s application of the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses resulted in an allowance for loan losses of million at december  compared with million at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses from december  reflects the addition of million of loan loss reserves as a result of the acquisition of the privatebank michigan  management s judgment about the generalized risk of real estate related lending in our various markets  the addition of new lending personnel as well as strong loan growth from all existing offices in we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   down from at december  net recoveries totaled  for the year ended 
table of contents december  versus net charge offs of  in the year earlier period 
the provision for loan losses was million for the twelve months ended december   versus million in the prior year period 
under our methodology  the allowance for loan losses is comprised of the following components allocated inherent component of the reserve the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses is based on loan type and  starting in the second quarter  the allowance is also allocated by loan risk within each loan type 
the company assigns each of its loans a risk rating at the time of loan origination and either confirms or changes the risk rating at the time of subsequent reviews  loan renewals or upon default 
the loss allocations are based on a combination of a historical analysis of the company s losses and adjustment factors deemed relevant by management 
the adjustment factors take into account banking industry wide loss statistics  current facts and circumstances  and long term economic trends 
during the second quarter  the historical analysis was enhanced to include a five year migration analysis of the company s losses and the documentation of the loss adjustment factors was augmented 
the allocated inherent component of the reserve increased by million during  from million at december  to million at december  the increase in the allocated portion of the reserve reflects higher loan volumes in every category  particularly construction  commercial  and residential real estate loans 
specific component of the reserve for loans where management deems either the amount or the timing of the repayment to be significantly impaired  there are specific reserve allocations established 
the specific reserve is based on a loan s current value compared to the present value of its projected future cash flows  collateral value or market value  as is relevant for the particular loan pursuant to sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
as of december   management has concluded that there are no loans in the portfolio that require specific reserves 
the specific component of the reserve decreased by million during  from million at december  to zero at december  after giving effect to  in recoveries during the period 
unallocated inherent components of the reserve the unallocated inherent component of the reserve is based on management s review of other factors affecting the determination of probable losses inherent in the portfolio  which are not necessarily captured by the application of loss and loss adjustment factors 
this portion of the reserve analysis involves the exercise of judgment and reflects consideration such as management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
the unallocated inherent component of the reserve increased by million for  from million at december  to million at december  reflecting the impact of a larger overall loan portfolio and the addition of the privatebank michigan portfolio

nonaccrual loans are returned to an accrual status when the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the payment of principal or interest 
other than those loans reflected in the table above  we had no significant loans for which the terms had been renegotiated or restructured  or for which there were serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with repayment terms 
we did not have any other real estate owned as of any of the dates shown 
potential problem loans 
in addition to those loans reflected in the table above  we have identified some loans through our problem loan identification process which exhibit a higher than normal credit risk 
loans in this category include loans with characteristics such as past maturity more than days  those that have recent adverse operating cash flow or balance sheet trends  or loans that have general risk characteristics that management believes might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments

at december   the company s consolidated investment in federal home loan bank fhlb stock was million  compared to million at december  the reduction in this investment reflects gradual redemptions of excess fhlb chicago stock initiated by the company in response to reductions in the dividend rate paid on such stock and to take advantage of higher yields available on loans and other investments 
the company redeemed million of its excess fhlb chicago stock in each of the first three quarters of  and an additional million of its fhlb chicago stock on october   after which its investment totaled million

the remainder of fhlb chicago stock represents excess or voluntary stock 
on october   the fhlb chicago announced an annualized dividend rate of payable in the fourth quarter this new dividend rate reflected a reduction of basis points from the annualized dividend rate that was declared in the third quarter in addition to announcing the lower dividend rate  the fhlb chicago also announced at this same time that it would suspend redemptions of excess or voluntary capital stock until further notice 
the fhlb chicago further stated that it had entered into an amendment to its written agreement with the federal housing board to reduce the fhlb chicago s minimum capital ratio from to  to require the fhlb chicago to maintain minimum total capital of billion  the balance as of october   and to provide that no fhlb chicago stock will be redeemed if the redemption would cause the fhlb chicago to fail to meet such capital requirements 
on january   the fhlb chicago issued a press release announcing another decrease in its annualized dividend rate to from in the prior quarter 
in announcing the suspension of redemptions of its voluntary stock  the fhlb chicago stated that it took these actions to help ensure an adequate capital base for the fhlb chicago to continue to service the needs of its members 
the fhlb chicago also stated an intention to resume redemptions as soon as possible  subject to finance board approval 
prior to this announcement  the fhlb chicago had exercised its discretion with respect to redemptions of excess stock by maintaining a practice of redeeming such stock upon the request of the member 
as an alternative to a discretionary redemption of excess stock  the fhlb chicago is required to redeem all of a member s stock in the event of a withdrawal from membership upon six months prior notice 
on october   the company delivered to the fhlb chicago written notice of its intent to withdraw its membership and obtain redemption of all of the fhlb chicago stock held by the company upon the effective date of the withdrawal 
pursuant to applicable regulation  the withdrawal and the fhlb chicago s obligation to redeem the company s stock will not be effective until april  in addition  the company must pay its outstanding fhlb chicago advances prior to the effective date of the withdrawal and will not have access for a period of five years thereafter to advances from the fhlb chicago 
the company has been advised by the fhlb chicago that it is permitted to rescind its notice of membership withdrawal at any time prior to its effective date  without fee or penalty 
in anticipation of withdrawing its membership and substantially reducing its investment in fhlb chicago stock  the company reduced its fhlb chicago advances in the fourth quarter from million to million 
on november   the company received a letter from the fhfb in response to its membership withdrawal 
the letter states that the fhlb chicago would not be required to redeem the company s stock at the effective date if the fhlb chicago would fall below the equity or billion capital stock requirement if the existing written agreement with the fhfb was still in effect on april  in its form filed with the sec on february   the fhlb chicago reiterated this position 
the company believes that the redemption of its stock at the effective date of its withdrawal request is not limited by these october  capital requirements but instead governed by rules in effect before november   so long as the fhlb chicago has not implemented its new capital plan 
these prior rules require redemption of a withdrawing member s stock upon the expiration of the six month notice period  subject only to a finding by the fhfb that the fhlb chicago s capital is impaired 
no assurance can be given that the fhlb chicago will have 
table of contents adequate capital under the prior rules to redeem the company s stock at the effective time of its withdrawal or that the fhlb chicago or the fhfb will not take action which precludes such redemption 
the company believes that adequate funding from a variety of wholesale funding sources  included brokered deposits and advances from either the fhlb indianapolis or the fhlb des moines  have been and will continue to be available to replace the fhlb chicago advances on terms that will not have a material impact  either positively or negatively  on the company s net interest margin

risk management we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
during  we began to hedge interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool 
interest rate risk we use a combination of financial instruments  including medium term and short term financings and variable rate debt instruments and  to a lesser extent  interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related cash flows 
to manage this mix in a cost effective manner  in we entered into our first interest rate swap transaction in which we agreed to receive a fixed rate in exchange for payment of a floating rate based on an agreed upon notional amount 
the fair value of the swap associated with this fair value hedge was  on december  and matured in october as market interest rates continued to decline to historic lows in the second half of  the value of our long term tax exempt bank qualified municipal bond portfolio increased 
in order to protect this gain should rates rise  we entered into a million swap agreement whereby we sold the year swap and bought three month libor to act as an economic hedge to a portion of our long municipal bonds

in addition  while repositioning the fhlb chicago advances in the fourth quarter  we repaid a floating rate million advance costing three month libor plus basis points

failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
the prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized  although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition 
if a banking subsidiary is not well capitalized  regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits 
if undercapitalized  capital distributions are limited as is asset growth and expansion and plans for capital restoration are required

table of contents as of december   million of the company s million of trust preferred securities are included in tier capital 
the tier qualifying amount is limited to of tier capital under federal reserve regulations 
as of december  the company owned of the common securities of three trusts  privatebancorp statutory trust ii  bloomfield hills statutory trust i and privatebancorp statutory trust iii 
privatebancorp statutory trust ii and privatebancorp statutory trust iii were established as wholly owned subsidiaries of the company in june and december  respectively 
bloomfield hills statutory trust i was acquired as part of the acquisition of bhb on june  the trusts were formed for purposes of issuing trust preferred securities to third party investors and investing the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities and common securities solely in junior subordinated debentures debentures issued by the company or bhb  as the case may be  with the same maturities and interest rates as the trust preferred securities 
the debentures are the sole assets of the trusts 
on june   the company issued million in fixed floating rate trust preferred securities through privatebancorp statutory trust ii  a newly created business trust subsidiary 
the trust preferred securities will pay interest quarterly at a fixed rate of for the initial five years and then subsequently pay interest quarterly at a floating rate equal to month libor plus 
the trust preferred securities have a year final maturity and are callable at par at the option of the company in whole or in part after year five  on any interest payment date 
in connection with the acquisition of bhb  the company acquired million in floating rate junior subordinated debenture trust preferred securities 
the trust preferred securities pay interest quarterly at a rate of month libor plus 
the trust preferred securities have a maturity date of june  and are callable beginning june  and at any interest payment date thereafter 
on december   the company issued million of trust preferred securities and related junior subordinated debentures 
these securities mature in december but are redeemable at par at our option after five years 
the trust preferred securities pay quarterly distributions at a rate of for five years and thereafter at a rate equal to the three month libor rate plus 
a portion of the proceeds was used to fund the redemption  on december  of million of previously outstanding trust preferred securities that were originally issued in as a result of this redemption  the company incurred a one time  pre tax charge of approximately  by refunding this million of trust preferred securities at a rate of from  we will reduce our annual carrying cost by  to be considered well capitalized  an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
to be adequately capitalized  an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
at december   the company  the privatebank chicago  the privatebank st 
louis and the privatebank michigan exceeded the minimum levels of all regulatory capital requirements  and were considered well capitalized under regulatory standards 
at december   our total risk based capital ratio was compared to at december  liquidity liquidity measures our ability to meet maturing obligations and our existing commitments  to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels  to fund our operations and to provide for our clients credit needs 
our liquidity principally depends on our cash flows from our operating activities  investment in and maturity of assets  changes in balances of deposits and borrowings and our ability to borrow funds 
table of contents in the money or capital markets 
liquidity management involves planning to meet anticipated funding needs at a reasonable cost 
liquidity management is guided by policies  formulated and monitored by our senior management and the banks asset liability committees  which take into account the marketability of assets  the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments 
our principal sources of funds are deposits  short term borrowings and capital contributions by privatebancorp to the banks funded by proceeds from draws on our line of credit or through new capital 
our core deposits  the most stable source of liquidity due to the nature of long term relationships generally established with our clients  are available to provide long term liquidity 
at december   of our total assets were funded by core deposits  compared to at december  core deposits for purposes of this ratio are defined as to include all deposits including time deposits but excluding brokered deposits and public funds 
time deposits are included as core deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us 
over the past several years  our clients have chosen to keep the maturities of their time deposits short 
in the event that certain of these certificates of deposit are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the bank  unless those deposits are replaced with other core deposits  brokered deposits  borrowed money or capital  we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs 
we have continued to use fhlb advances and brokered deposits as alternative methods of funding growth 
during  we first utilized brokered deposits as a funding tool to enhance liquidity in anticipation of increasing loan demand 
during and we maintained our brokered deposits program in order to fund liquidity of the privatebank chicago and the privatebank st 
louis 
in  we expect to continue to rely on brokered deposits as an alternative method of funding growth 
our asset liability management policy currently limits our use of brokered deposits to levels no more than of total deposits 
we do not expect our threshold limitation to limit our ability to implement our growth plan 
we will first look toward internally generated deposits as funding sources  but plan to supplement our funding needs with wholesale funding sources as needed 
consistent with this policy  brokered deposits to total deposits were of total deposits at december   compared to of total deposits at december  liquid assets refer to money market assets such as federal funds sold  as well as available for sale securities 
net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds and certain deposits that require collateral 
at december   net liquid assets at the privatebank chicago were million as compared to million at december  at december   net liquid assets at the privatebank st 
louis were million as compared to million at december  at december   net liquid assets at the privatebank michigan were million 
net cash inflows provided by operations were million for the year ended december  compared to a net inflow of million a year earlier 
net cash outflows from investing activities were million for the year ended december   compared to net cash outflows of million a year earlier 
cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended december  were million compared to a net inflow of million in in the event of short term liquidity needs  each of the banks may purchase federal funds from correspondent banks 
on december   our total availability of overnight fed funds borrowings was million  of which we had million outstanding 
our total availability of overnight fed funds borrowings is not a committed line of credit  and is dependent upon lender availability 
in addition  we currently have available borrowing capacity of million under the million credit facility with lasalle bank 
we utilize this credit facility from time to time for general business purposes 
at december   we had in borrowings outstanding under the revolving line 

table of contents impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry 
under these principles and practices  we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a continuing part of our financial strategy  we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income 
this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and maintenance of yield 
asset liability management policy is established by our investment committee of our board of directors and is monitored by management 
our asset liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate 
these standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations  liquidity  loan limits as a percentage of funding sources  exposure to correspondent banks and brokers  and reliance on non core deposits 
the policy also states our reporting requirements to our board of directors 
the investment policy complements the asset liability management policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities 
these criteria include approved types of securities  brokerage sources  terms of investment  quality standards  and diversification 
we measure the impact of interest rate changes on our income statement through the use of gap analysis 
the gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods 
during any given time period  if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets  a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time 
conversely  a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates 
we have structured our assets and liabilities to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment 
we manage our gap position at the one year horizon 
depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short and long term  we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset liability management policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk 
our policy states that we shall maintain a rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities position at the one year horizon between and 
our position at december  was and was within the guidelines of our policy 
we have continued to maintain our gap position set by our policy guidelines and expect to continue to operate in this manner as long as the general rate structure of the economy and our business opportunities remain consistent 
a flattening yield curve has compressed net interest margin  however over the long term  we expect our net interest margin to benefit during a rising rate environment and alternatively  if market rates decrease  we expect our net interest margin to decrease 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
there are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our income statement 
for example  a rapid drop in interest rates might cause our loans to repay at a more rapid pace and certain mortgage related investments to prepay more quickly than projected 
this could mitigate some of the benefits of falling rates that are expected 
table of contents when negatively gapped 
conversely  a rapid rise in rates could give us an opportunity to increase our margins and slow the rate of repayment on our mortgage related loans  which would increase our returns

the simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis 
assets and liabilities then reprice based on their terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period 
the model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred 
december  december  basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points basis points percentage change in net interest income due to an immediate and basis point change in interest rates over a one year time horizon this table shows that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points on december   net interest income would increase by over a one year period  as compared to a net interest income increase of if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift of basis points at december  due to current market interest rates  a basis point shift is presented for december  as a more reasonable illustration of possible rate 
table of contents changes 
the measurement of a basis point instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve at december  would result in an increase in net interest income of over a one year period as compared to measured on the basis of the december  portfolio 
at december   if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of  we would have suffered a decline in net interest income of  as compared to decline measured on the basis of the december  portfolio 
at december   if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of  we would have suffered a decline in net interest income of  as compared to a decline measured on the basis of the december  changes in the effect on net interest income from a and basis point movement at december   compared to december  are due to the timing and nature of the repricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within the one year time frame 
the table presented above reflects that the company is more interest rate sensitive at december  as compared to december  there are several factors contributing to the company becoming more asset sensitive in   including the impact of the acquisition of the privatebank michigan  and the growth of floating rate loans  which represent a larger percentage of the company s balance sheet at december  versus december  additionally  the company s borrowed funds have a longer duration when comparing december  to december   further contributing to asset sensitivity 
the lengthening of borrowed funds duration resulted from the partial conversion of federal funds purchased at december  to longer term funding at december   the renewal of maturity funding  and the addition of million of fixed rate trust preferred securities issued in june in connection with the acquisition of the privatebank michigan 
in december  we called million of trust preferred securities and replaced them with million of trust preferred securities 
these securities  which mature in december  but are redeemable at par at the company s option after five years  were issued initially at a rate of until december and thereafter at a rate equal to the three month libor rate plus 
the preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  changes in deposit levels  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change 
we continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets  sell investment securities  or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk
