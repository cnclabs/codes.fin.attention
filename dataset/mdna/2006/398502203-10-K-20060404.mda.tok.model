in july  we completed a transaction with starwood hotels and resorts worldwide  inc pursuant to which we sold  shares of restricted common stock and  stock purchase warrants exercisable at to starwood for  concurrently  we sold an additional  shares of restricted common stock and  stock purchase warrants exercisable at to other strategic investors for  all warrants issued in the transaction expire in july starwood alliance in conjunction with the july investment by starwood  we and starwood entered into a development agreement under which we and starwood agreed to jointly develop our restaurant properties in starwood hotels 
under the starwood development agreement  either we or starwood may propose to develop a daily grill  grill or city bar and grill restaurant in a starwood hotel property 
if the parties agree in principal to the development of a restaurant  the parties will attempt to negotiate either a management agreement or a license agreement with respect to the operation of the restaurant 
under the development agreement  we are obligated to issue to starwood warrants to acquire a number of shares of our common stock equal to four percent of the outstanding shares upon the attainment of certain development milestones 
such warrants are issuable upon execution of management agreements and or license agreements relating to the development and operation  and the commencement of operation  of an aggregate of five  ten  fifteen and twenty of our branded restaurants 
if the market price of our common stock on the date the warrants are to be issued is greater than the market price on the date of the development agreement  the warrants will be exercisable at a price equal to the greater of of the market price as of the date such warrant becomes issuable  or the market price on the date of the development agreement 
if the market price of our common stock on the date the warrants are to be issued is less than the market price on the date of the development agreement  the warrants will be exercisable at a price equal to the market price as of the date such warrants become issuable 
the warrants will be exercisable for a period of five years 
in addition to the warrants described above  if and when the aggregate number of restaurants operated under the development agreement exceeds of the total daily grill  grill and city grill branded restaurants  we will be obligated to issue to starwood a warrant to purchase a number of shares of our common stock equal to of the outstanding shares on that date exercisable for a period of five years at a price equal to the market price at that date 
on each anniversary of that date at which the restaurants operated under the development agreement continues to exceed the threshold  for so long as the development agreement remains effective  we shall issue to starwood additional warrants to purchase of the outstanding shares on that date at an exercise price equal to the market price on that date 
following the events of september   starwood substantially curtailed new development activities and only two management agreements have  as yet  been entered into under the development agreement 
the exclusivity portions of the agreement have terminated due to the lack of performance on starwood s part 
short term financing requirements management believes that we have adequate resources on hand and operating cash flow to sustain operations for at least the following months through march we project increased operating cash flows in which  when added to existing cash balances  will allow us to meet all operating  investing and financing needs 
such projections are based on sales increases due to store openings  as well as modest increases in same store sales 
in the event of a decline in sales  as a result of deterioration of the economy or the hospitality industry or other factors  management believes it can respond to such a decrease in sales through cost controls  reductions in discretionary capital improvements and borrowings under the existing credit facility 
in order to fund the opening of additional restaurants  we might require additional capital that might be raised through the issuance of debt or equity securities  or the formation of additional investment loan arrangements  or a combination thereof 
in march we obtained a new line of credit to fund future growth 
the new line provides a revolving term loan of the lesser of million or times the trailing twelve month ebitda with interest only payments at approximately with a maturity of march  we are currently in discussions regarding several potential restaurant locations however  other than our planned opening of a grill in dallas  texas  as of march   we had no commitments to lease additional space or open additional restaurants 
see business business expansion and management s discussion and analysis certain factors affecting future operating results 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
principals of consolidation and minority interests 
our restaurant operations are conducted through multiple wholly owned subsidiaries as well as through five majority owned limited liability companies and through a owned joint venture 
our consolidated financial statements include balance sheet and income statement items  after eliminating inter company accounts and transactions  of each wholly owned and majority owned subsidiary and entities consolidated under fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
the allocated interest of the earnings or loss of majority owned subsidiaries attributable to the minority owners of those subsidiaries is reflected in a single statement of operations entry  with minority interests in earnings being a reduction in net income and minority interests in losses being an increase in net income 
the proportionate interest in the equity of majority owned subsidiaries attributable to the minority owners of those subsidiaries is reflected as a single balance sheet entry between liabilities and stockholders equity 
we allocate profits and losses to the minority interest in our majority owned subsidiaries based on the underlying economics of the investment 
these may or may not reflect our ownership percentage and can be inconsistent with the allocation provisions specified in the joint venture agreements 
where there is a disparity among the ownership percentages  the terms of the agreements and the underlying economics  we utilize a hypothetical liquidation model to allocate profits and losses 
under this model  all of the ventures assets and liabilities as reflected in the balance sheet are assumed to be realized at their gaap carrying values 
the hypothetical liquidating proceeds are calculated at the end of each period and applied to the capital accounts as would occur under a true liquidation scenario 
the change in this balance from period to period represents the investors share of the income or loss 
under fin  an entity is considered to be a variable interest entity vie when it has equity investors which lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest  or its capital is insufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
consolidation of a vie by an investor is required when it is determined that the investor is the primary beneficiary and will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or residual returns if they occur 
management has assessed all entities which are not wholly owned by us to determine if these entities would be considered vies and whether we would be considered the primary beneficiary 
it was determined that all of the following entities would be considered vies the san jose grill llc  chicago the grill on the alley llc  the grill on hollywood llc  the daily grill at continental park llc  flower daily grill llc and the universal citywalk daily grill joint partnership 
we determined that we are the primary beneficiary for all these entities 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review all long lived assets on a regular basis to determine if there has been impairment in the value of those assets 
if  upon review  it is determined that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable  we will record a charge to earnings and reduce the value of the asset on the balance sheet to the amount determined to be recoverable 
for purposes of evaluating recoverability of long lived assets  the recoverability test is performed using undiscounted cash flows of the individual restaurants and consolidated undiscounted net cash flows for long lived assets not identifiable to individual restaurants compared to the related carrying value 
if the undiscounted operating income is less than the carrying value  the amount of the impairment  if any  will be determined by comparing the carrying value of each asset with its fair value 
fair value is generally based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
based on our review of our presently operating restaurants and other long lived assets  during the fiscal year ended december   we recorded no impairments of our long lived assets 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we review all of our accounts receivable on a regular basis to determine the collectability of each account based on age  response to collection efforts  and other factors 
we establish a reserve for those accounts where collection seems doubtful 
if a determination is made that the customer will definitely not pay  the amount is written off against the reserve 
based on our review at december   the current reserve for uncollectable accounts receivable is adequate 
recording reimbursable costs 
we operate a number of restaurants under management agreements whereby we are responsible for all aspects of restaurant operation 
for our services  we typically receive a management fee based on a percentage of revenue and an incentive fee which is usually a profit sharing arrangement 
under the terms of the management agreements  we are hired as an independent contractor and are responsible for all debts and liabilities of the restaurant 
additionally  all employees are employees of grill concepts  not the individual restaurant 
although payroll and other operating expenses are paid out of an agency bank account belonging to the restaurant  based on the weight of the indicators identified in eift  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  and eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we consider ourselves the primary obligor in these arrangements 
accordingly  we recognize restaurant expenses of the managed outlets in our financial statements and record the reimbursement for such expenses as revenues 
hrp 
the company is party to mirroring put and call options whereby hrp has the right to require the company to buy hrp and the company has the right to buy hrp on substantially identical terms 
the company concluded that the options relating to hrp would be defined as a derivative under fas however  because the purchase price was based on a floating price  it was determined that the value of the put and call would be identical so long as the formula resulted in a representative fair value of hrp 
the company concluded that the multiple was based on fair value because the original formula was negotiated between two parties 
this fact was reconfirmed when the hrp agreement was amended approximately three years later at the time the company entered into a development agreement with starwood hotels and the multiple for the hrp put and call options did not change 
we believe the multiple used in the formula to be within a tolerable range of those found in the marketplace 
therefore  management believes that the formula is a reasonable approximation of fair value of the hrp business that results in the put and call options having similar values 
additionally  because fair market puts and calls have little value on their own  any asset and liability related to these would be insignificant 
no derivative accounting is necessary in these circumstances and therefore  no accounting recognition has been made in the financial statements 
the company will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of formula to market conditions to ensure it represents fair market value  and will continue to evaluate the formula going forward and to the extent it no longer represents fair market value  will account for the derivative appropriately 
certain factors affecting future operating results this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
certain factors that might cause such a difference include the following adverse weather conditions and other conditions affecting agricultural output which may cause shortages of key food ingredients and volatility of food prices and which  in turn  may reduce operating margins  changes in consumer tastes  demographics and adverse economic conditions which may result in reduced frequency of dining at our restaurants  the dependence on key personnel and ability to attract and retain qualified management and restaurant personnel to support existing operations and future growth  regulatory developments  particularly relating to labor matters ie  minimum wage  health insurance and other benefit requirements  health and safety conditions  service of alcoholic beverages and taxation  which could increase the cost of restaurant operations  establishment of market position and consumer acceptance in new markets in light of intense competition in the restaurant industry and the geographic separation of senior management from such markets  potential delays in securing sites for new restaurants and delays in opening restaurants which may entail additional costs and lower revenues than would otherwise exist in the absence of such delays  the availability of capital to fund future restaurant openings  rising energy costs and the occurrence of rolling blackouts in california which may result in higher occupancy costs and periodic restaurant closures  and  other risks described more fully in risk factors beginning on page new accounting requirements in june  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination eitf 
eitf provides that the amortization period for leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased after the inception of a lease be the shorter of a the useful life of the assets or b a term that includes required lease periods and renewals that are reasonably assured upon the acquisition or the purchase 
the provision of eitf are effective for leasehold improvements purchased or acquired beginning july the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb posted fasb staff position fsp  which requires that rental costs incurred during and after a construction period for the right to control the use of a leased asset during and after construction of a lessee asset to be recognized as rental expense 
the provisions of fsp shall be applied to the first reporting period beginning after december  the company s existing accounting policy for rental costs incurred during and after the construction period conforms to fsp the adoption of fsp will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in april  the eitf reached final consensus on eitf  participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
 which requires companies that have participating securities to calculate earnings per share using the two class method 
this method requires the allocation of undistributed earnings to the common shares and participating securities based on the proportion of undistributed earnings that each would have been entitled to had all the period s earnings been distributed 
eitf is effective for fiscal periods beginning after march  and earnings per share reported in prior periods presented must be retroactively adjusted in order to comply with eitf the company adopted eitf for the quarter ended june   however there has been no impact on the company s financial statements as the preferred shares are not participating securities 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb no 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement r s fair value method may have a significant impact on our result of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share above 
we expect to adopt statement r in the first quarter of impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor and operating expenses  could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to customers 
we do not believe that inflation has materially affected our operating results during the past two years 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
our cost of operations have been affected by several increases in the federal and state minimum wage in recent years 
in addition  further increases in the minimum wage are also being discussed by the federal and various state governments 
although we have been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along increases in costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in our prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  to some degree  customer spending at its restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
this exposure relates to our credit line facility 
at december  there are no borrowings under the credit line 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the lender s prime rate 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have a material impact on our results of operations
