item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview techteam is a global provider of information technology it and business process outsourcing support services to fortune companies  multinational companies  product providers  small and mid size companies  and government entities 
in  we furthered our business strategy of the past four years by strategically strengthening the company s service offerings in the it outsourcing services and it consulting and systems integration business segments through a combination of organic growth  acquisitions  and enhancements to our business model  and we have added government technology services as a new industry vertical through acquisition 
on february   we announced the company s new president and chief executive officer  william c 
chris brown 
we expect that under mr 
brown s leadership we will seek to accelerate and enhance the drive to optimize our business delivery model  the strengthening of our core business offerings and vertical expertise through organic growth and strategic and accretive acquisitions  and the implementation of an aggressive sales and marketing strategy to sell the company s services 
the overall performance of our it outsourcing services business in showed a decline in revenue from primarily due to the previously reported loss of business with daimlerchrysler ag daimlerchrysler in the fourth quarter of and liberty mutual insurance company liberty mutual in the first quarter of while year over year performance of this segment was down from  we believe we made significant progress during in strengthening our it outsourcing services business segment  as well as our it consulting and systems integration business segment 
first  within these segments  we solidified our vertical expansion in the government technology services and retail and hospitality markets 
in government technology services  we acquired sytel  inc sytel on january   which was a significant driver of the company s financial performance in  especially during the first three quarters of the year when it accounted for of the company s total revenue and of the company s operating income 
we worked to substantially integrate techteam government solutions  inc formerly known as digital support corporation and sytel in order to maximize the value of our government technology services segment 
the integration plan includes the merging of all administrative functions  joining the operational resources into four distinct business lines us department of defense  civilian health care  civilian enterprise systems  and state  local and commercial services and enhancing the segment s sales resources and channel partners 
we ended with the implementation of this plan well under way 
however  we do not anticipate the financial benefit of the integration to begin to manifest until the second half of after the reduction in facilities is concluded 
we made progress in establishing the retail and hospitality industry as one of our major business vertical markets 
during  the systems implementation and training business performed by our techteam cyntergy subsidiary was a significant contributor to the financial performance of the it consulting and systems integration business segment  as we further developed our subcontractor relationship with micros  inc and developed a new relationship with galaxy systems  llc  a subsidiary of starwood hotels 
as these services are project based and the established projects that helped drive our performance in will be concluding during the first half of  we are seeking projects with new customers to replace the anticipated decrease in revenue in from we also significantly increased our help desk business for the retail market by adding two new  large retail customers 
these two new contracts announced in the fourth quarter of are expected to represent annual revenue in excess of million 
the launch of one of these customers is complete  while the launch of the second  and largest  of these two customers is not expected to be completed until the end of the second quarter of accordingly  due to the expenses related to the launch of these customers  we anticipate that these contracts will begin to be profitable over the second quarter of second  we have further expanded our service offerings in the it consulting and systems integration business segment through the acquisition of akela informatique srl now known as techteam akela srl  akela on october  akela provides application development  migration  implementation  and maintenance support services to clients in romania  france  the united kingdom  switzerland  belgium  italy  sweden and the united states 
over  we continued to optimize our business delivery model 
specifically  we received a three year extension to the ford global spoc program contract in december in light of the significant price pressures faced by the company from ford during the contract renegotiation  we demonstrated the flexibility to redesign the program and implement significant modifications that allowed ford to balance its need for a reduced cost of service while maintaining it productivity and end user satisfaction 
the renewal price for the service will reduce the per seat revenue that we earn from the global spoc program 
however  we do not expect that the redesigned program with its reduced service levels will result in a reduction in the gross margin earned from the program at least for the foreseeable future 
we have also made significant progress in developing our romanian help desk as a means of providing low cost multi lingual support to new and existing customers 
inasmuch as we are able to provide lower cost help desk support in french  german  italian  spanish and english from romania  we are utilizing romania as part of a solution that blends resources from different help desk locations within the company for existing customers that require multi lingual support 
we anticipate that this trend will continue during at a faster pace 
during  we further increased our capabilities of delivering help desk solutions in a shared environment  where we support more than one customer 
we deployed a shared environment for an it support help desk where our agents provide help desk and network support for multiple customers 
we also have implemented a strategy to provide our shared support environment for pharmaceutical companies in the electronic data capture of their drug trials from three sites southfield  michigan  brussels  belgium  and bucharest  romania 
as this business has significant quality and documentation requirements  we have developed integrated and detailed processes that enable us to provide consistent repeatable service while maximizing the efficiency of our operations 
we also developed a methodology necessary to optimize our delivery of help desk services together with other it services 
during  we successfully launched desk side support services for a major business unit of deere co 
as a result of the additional it support business within deere  we have been able to move our help desk resources that have substantial expertise in the deere environment to new positions within deere 
this enables us to provide our resources with career advancement and to replace them with less expensive resources 
we will continue to strongly pursue this spoc business model within our existing customer base and in our new sales efforts 
the optimization of our operating model is constantly evolving due to intense global competition 
the effects of this intense competition can be seen in romania 
over the past year  a number of companies  including outsourcing competitors  have decided to open call centers in bucharest 
as a result of the increased competition for multi lingual resources  we expect our labor costs to continue to increase at a rate greater than the company experiences in other regions 
in an effort to address this risk  we are evaluating other regions within romania to establish new operations 
further  we are evaluating expansion to the far east in an effort to expand our multi lingual capabilities and to provide english language services at a lower cost 
during  we embarked on a sales and marketing strategy that focused on enhancing our sales force and pursuing relationships with other companies to help sell our services 
with the four contracts announced in the fourth quarter  we began to see some additional traction from our added sales force and our channel partners 
however  we are concerned about the slowed growth in europe  where despite good growth in the business from a revenue perspective  we did not sign any significant conracts with any new customers in europe during we look to aggressively increase our partnerships with other companies during or later 
however  our sales cycle remains lengthy and we may not see the benefits of our efforts until the second half of furthermore  to the extent that we are successful in obtaining large it outsourcing customers during the year  our experience indicates that there is a lag time between the launch of the project and when it produces a profit  the length of which is dependent upon the size of the customer and the project s launch schedule 
further  in our competitive business lines  we are faced with continued price pressure from our customers and inflationary pressures relating primarily to labor 
in the global market for help desk and bpo services  large customers have pricing power as they have a number of vendors who present different value propositions based upon different delivery models eg  shared vs 
dedicated desk and locations from which they provide service eg  united states vs 
romania 
we have begun to see increased competition for labor in a few of our markets  including romania and sweden 
in romania during  the general inflation rate was  and the local currency appreciated in value against the european euro 
taken with the increased number of companies vying for the same labor  the increase in labor costs has exceeded our expectations 
however  our turnover rates remain lower than industry standards  and we do not believe that these inflationary pressures will have a material impact on our financial performance in our global operational strategy requires us to blend resources from multiple locations around the world to deliver efficient services for our customers 
we must rely on sophisticated technology in order to run multi site projects 
in  we launched our global human resource management tool 
we started in  and will continue in  to implement a new generation phone switch that will better enable us to manage the help desk call volume among our different locations 
we must continue to invest in our technology to enable us to optimize our operational performance 
recent developments as mentioned previously  william c 
chris brown replaced william f 
coyro  jr 
as our president and chief executive officer on february  costa brava partnership iii  lp  an owner of of the outstanding common stock of the company  has notified us that it will be submitting a slate of seven nominees to stand for election to the company s board of directors 
the company has announced its intention to nominate its own state and to contest costa brava s slate 
we have retained the services of appropriate professionals to assist us in this potential proxy contest 
as a result  we anticipate incurring an unknown level of expense that will impact the company s financial performance in the first and second quarters of results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease change in thousands revenue it outsourcing services   government technology services    it consulting and systems integration

revenue growth was also favorably impacted by our acquisition of akela on october   and having a full year of activity from techteam ane ane  which we acquired on may  excluding the acquisitions of sytel  akela  and ane for both periods  total revenue increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to the aforementioned revenue growth from it consulting and systems integration services  which was partially offset by decreases in revenue from it outsourcing services and government technology services  as more fully discussed below 
it outsourcing services revenue from our it outsourcing services decreased to million in  from million in  as a result of revenue growth from our blended service delivery solution in belgium and romania  offset by a decline in revenue from it outsourcing services of in the united states 
the growth in belgium and romania is primarily due to customer contracts launched in the decrease in revenue in the united states is due to the decline in revenue from the loss of business from daimlerchrysler and liberty mutual insurance company liberty mutual  which was partially offset by new customer contracts 
revenue in also declined from from a decrease in global it outsourcing revenue from ford of to million in  from million for the comparable period in revenue from ford decreased primarily due to a reduction in the number of seats supported as ford continues to restructure its operations and reduce its worldwide workforce 
please refer to our discussion of ford in the overview section of md a 
although our it outsourcing revenue in the united states declined from  we recently announced that the company has signed contracts with four major companies to provide specialized it support services 
the estimated aggregate value of the contracts is approximately million over the three year length of each contract 
the company began providing services to these customers during the fourth quarter of  with the last phase of the largest program launch expected to be completed during the second quarter of once these programs are fully launched  the vast majority of our southfield  michigan  facility will be utilized

although revenue grew substantially in  revenue from this business segment decreased in the fourth quarter of  from the third quarter of  due to the previously reported loss of a contract at sytel with the united states department of state see note acquisitions contained in item financial statements and supplementary data 
revenue from this contract was million in it consulting and systems integration services revenue from it consulting and systems integration increased to million in  from million in  due to revenue growth at techteam cyntergy and our acquisition of ane on may  excluding ane for both periods  revenue from it consulting and systems integration increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to additional business from new and existing customers at techteam cyntergy

excluding revenue contributed by sytel  revenue generated in the united states decreased to million in  from million in  primarily due to the decline in revenue from daimlerchrysler and liberty mutual  which was partially offset by new customer contracts in it outsourcing services and revenue growth in it consulting and systems integration services from techteam cyntergy 
revenue generated in europe increased to million in  from million in  primarily due to growth in business in belgium and romania from new customer contracts  and our acquisitions of ane and akela 
excluding revenue contributed by ane and akela  revenue generated in europe increased to million in  from million in if revenue in europe for each quarter in were translated into us dollars at the average exchange rate for each comparable quarter in  reported revenue would be reduced by approximately  since most of the company s international operating expenses are also incurred in the same foreign currencies in which the associated revenue is denominated  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on net income is considerably less than the estimated impact on revenue and is not material 
although the impact of exchange rate fluctuations did not have a significant affect on reported revenue for  the estimated impact on revenue was significant on a quarter by quarter basis 
reported revenue in the first and second quarters of was favorably affected by approximately million  while reported revenue in the third and fourth quarters of was negatively affected by approximately million  most of which occurred in the fourth quarter as the us dollar strengthened relative to the european euro and  to a lesser extent  the british pound sterling and swedish kroner

excluding the asset impairment charge  gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease in gross profit and gross margin is a result of the aforementioned decline in revenue from daimlerchrysler and liberty mutual in the united states and lower gross profit and gross margin on our ford business in europe 
the resulting underutilization of our facility in southfield  michigan  resulting from the loss of business from daimlerchrysler and liberty mutual negatively impacted our gross margin 
these declines were partially offset by growth and margin improvement from our blended service delivery solution in belgium and romania and from our ford business in the united states 
government technology services gross profit from government technology services increased to million in  from million in gross margin from government technology services increased to in  from in the increase in gross profit is primarily due to our acquisition of sytel and new business from existing customers

   net interest income foreign currency transaction gain loss income tax provision   selling  general  and administrative sg a expense increased to million  or of total revenue in  from million  or of total revenue in this increase of approximately million in sg a expense can be primarily attributed to the acquisitions of sytel  ane  and akela million  costs related to the company s compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of million  deployment of a new global human capital management system  and a favorable adjustment made to the company s fourth quarter results related to michigan single business tax  which had the effect of making the company s sg a expense appear less than it would otherwise have been 
other increases resulted from fees related to the replacement of the company s chief executive officer and the search for other management positions  additional personnel and facility costs associated with the establishment of the company s permanent facility in romania  reinstatement of the company s k plan matching contribution in november  and higher sales commissions and other sales and marketing expenses from the expansion of our north american sales force 
these increases were partially offset by lower expense in under the company s incentive compensation plans as certain performance targets were not met 
in  we expect sg a expense to remain near the level of of revenue as we continue to invest in our global sales and marketing capabilities  we invest in technology infrastructure including a new telecommunications system  and we undertake efforts to expand the technical certifications of the company and its employees in areas such as the information technology infrastructure library itil 
we also expect to incur an unknown level of expense related to the proxy contest for control of the company s board of directors 
as noted above  we incurred approximately million in related to the company s compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires us to certify our system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure 
we expect to incur between  million of expense in to continue our compliance efforts with this section of the sarbanes oxley act 
these costs may increase if it is determined that significant efforts will be required to remediate control deficiencies that may be identified from time to time 
in addition  significant time and effort of management is required 
net interest income decreased to  in  from  in  as a result of the company borrowing million on january  under a term loan to partially finance the acquisition of sytel  and reduced interest income from cash and cash equivalents being held as collateral for the term loan in a non interest bearing account

excluding the impairment charge  gross margin from it outsourcing services increased to in  from in this improvement in gross margin was also partially offset by the impact of reductions in revenue under our ford contract  as discussed above

in  the consolidated effective tax rate of differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the unfavorable tax effect of providing a valuation allowance against the future tax benefit of operating loss carryforwards in certain foreign tax jurisdictions and the existence of nondeductible expenses 
impact of business with major clients we conduct business under multiple contracts with various entities within the ford organization and with various agencies and departments of the united states government 
ford accounted for of the company s total revenue in  as compared to in and in the united states government accounted for of the company s total revenue in  as compared to in and in no single agency or department of the united states government comprised or greater of the company s total revenue for all periods presented 
ford motor company our business with ford consists of help desk services  technical staffing  network management  support services provided to volvo car corporation  a subsidiary of ford  and a specific project installing personal computers subcontracted through dell inc ford s long term debt rating was lowered to below investment grade status by standard poor s rating services on may   and was downgraded further on march   by fitch ratings services 
at this time  we do not expect this downgrade to negatively affect our business with ford or the collectibility of our accounts receivable from ford 
however  any loss of or failure to retain a significant amount of business with ford or bankruptcy filing by ford would have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable from ford and the company s operating results and liquidity 
united states government the us government s fiscal year ends on september of each year 
it is not uncommon for government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of the fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds 
moreover  in years when the us government does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year  government operations typically are funded pursuant to a continuing resolution that authorizes agencies of the government to continue to operate  but traditionally does not authorize new spending initiatives 
when the government operates pursuant to a continuing resolution  delays can occur in procurement of products and services  and such delays can affect the company s revenue  profit  and cash flow during the period of delay 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas and supersedes apb sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb  and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method 
sfas r is effective for awards that are granted  modified  or settled in periods beginning after december   or the company s fiscal year beginning january  the company will adopt sfas r on january  as we use the fair value method of accounting under the original provisions of sfas for pro forma disclosure purposes  we are also required to apply the provisions of sfas r in recognizing compensation cost for any portion of awards granted or modified after december   that are not yet vested at the date sfas r is adopted 
adoption of sfas r will result in approximately  of aggregate compensation expense  net of tax  in fiscal years subsequent to for non vested stock options outstanding at december  however  to the extent the company grants additional stock options in future periods  the company s compensation expense in future periods will increase 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at december   as compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased million in primarily due to million in cash used to acquire sytel net of debt borrowings of million used to finance the acquisition  million in payments to reduce long term debt  million in cash used for capital expenditures  and million in payments to the former shareholders of dsc  partially offset by million in cash provided by operations and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options 
cash provided by operations of million in was generated primarily by income prior to non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and increased from million in  primarily due to an increase in net income 
we experienced a significant increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable during  due to our acquisition of sytel 
under various task order contracts with the united states department of homeland security dhs  sytel serves as the prime contractor and electronic data systems corporation eds serves as its subcontractor 
eds performs in excess of of the work under the contract and creates the invoices  which sytel forwards to the dhs 
under the subcontract agreement between sytel and eds  sytel does not pay eds invoices until sytel receives payment from the dhs 
as a result  there has been an increase in our accounts receivable and accounts payable but a minimal impact on cash flow 
long term cash requirements  other than for normal operating expenses  are anticipated for the continued expansion in europe and possibly the far east  enhancements of existing technologies  possible repurchases of our common stock  additional consideration that is or may become payable to the selling shareholders of sytel  dsc  ane  and akela if specific performance conditions and operating targets are met in  possible global expansion activities  the possible payment of company dividends  and the possible acquisition of businesses complementary to the company s existing businesses 
we believe that positive cash flows from operations  together with existing cash balances  will continue to be sufficient to meet our ongoing operational requirements for the next twelve months and foreseeable future 
we have historically not paid dividends 
material commitments the company has the following contractual obligations outstanding at december operating maturities of contractual obligations debt leases less than one year  years  years   thereafter  total   critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements under gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  contingent liabilities  revenue recognition  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that our critical accounting policies that require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are revenue recognition  deferred income taxes  accounts receivable  goodwill impairment  long lived assets and identifiable intangible asset impairment  and business combinations 
revenue recognition under all situations  revenue is not recognized until earned  which is when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been provided  the revenue terms are fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we earn revenue under our it outsourcing services operating segment under one of the following four models time and material contracts under which we bill an agreed rate for each help desk agent based on the number of units ie  hours or days the individual agent worked during the month  per transaction contracts under which we bill an agreed rate per incident or call handled during a month or per minute for the length of the telephone call for the incident  fixed monthly fee contracts under which we agree to provide all of the agreed upon scheduled services on a monthly basis for a fixed monthly fee  and per seat contracts under which we agree to provide agreed upon scheduled services for a monthly fee that is determined by multiplying the number of users supported at the customer by the monthly per seat fee 
within the it outsourcing services operating segment  greater than of our services are delivered as a monthly service and not over multiple periods 
we also refer to our fixed fee and per seat contracts as managed service contracts 
many of our contracts that we bill on a per transaction basis contain a minimum monthly fee  which is derived by multiplying the agreed upon forecast of anticipated incidents by an agreed upon minimum percentage 
under this arrangement  we receive a minimum revenue amount for having committed to provide a specific level of staff to support the services projected during a month 
since we invoice the customer for the minimum fee and do not reduce future billings  we recognize the minimum fee as revenue in the month in which the incidents are below the customer s minimum forecast 
incident resolution usually occurs in the same month that incidents are reported 
under our managed service contracts  we generally do not incur material costs in a future month to complete a service obligation that arose in a prior month 
in those instances where our service obligation is not complete for a month and we expect to incur more than immaterial costs in a future month  we will defer an amount of revenue that represents the fair value of that service obligation 
revenue from all other services that we provide under our other operating segments government technology services  it consulting and systems integration  technical staffing  and learning services may be categorized into two primary types time and material and fixed price 
for the year ended december   approximately of the company s revenue in these business segments were time and material and were fixed price a substantial majority of which are fixed price level of effort contracts 
revenue is recognized under time and materials contracts as time is spent at hourly rates  which are negotiated with the customer  plus the cost of any allowable material costs and out of pocket expenses 
revenue is recognized under the majority of fixed price contracts  which are predominantly level of effort contracts  using the cost to cost method for all services provided 
in addition  we evaluate contracts for multiple deliverables  which may require the segmentation of each deliverable into separate accounting units for proper revenue recognition 
our contracts with agencies of the us federal government are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or ratably throughout the term of the contract as the services are provided 
from time to time the company may proceed with work on unfunded portions of existing contracts based on customer direction pending finalization and signing of formal funding documents 
all revenue recognition is deferred during periods in which funding is not received 
allowable contract costs incurred during such periods are deferred if the receipt of funding is assessed as probable 
in evaluating the probability of funding being received  we consider our previous experience with the customer  communications with the customer regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
if funding is not assessed as probable  costs are expensed as incurred 
we recognize revenue under cost based us federal government contracts based on allowable contract costs  as mandated by the federal government s cost accounting standards 
the costs the company incurs under federal government contracts are subject to regulation and audit by certain agencies of the federal government 
contract cost disallowances  resulting from government audits  have not historically been significant 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes represent temporary differences in the recognition of certain items for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets depends upon sufficient levels of future taxable income 
if at any time we believe that current or future taxable income does not support the realization of deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is provided 
based on historical losses in belgium and romania  we have provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforward in these countries 
we anticipate providing a valuation allowance for any future losses incurred in belgium and romania 
no valuation allowance has been recognized against other deferred tax assets  which are in the united states  as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized based on estimates of future taxable income  which have considered  among other factors  the future benefits of our recent acquisitions 
accounts receivable we periodically review our accounts receivable balances for collectibility based on a combination of historical experience and existing economic conditions 
the definition of delinquent accounts is based on the governing contractual terms 
delinquent accounts and balances are reserved when we determine they are more likely than not to become uncollectible 
our customers are generally large  well capitalized entities 
we generally do not require collateral and do not charge interest on past due balances 
our experience with delinquent accounts was adversely impacted by the bankruptcy of three customers in the third and fourth quarters of one customer was a former reseller of our leased equipment related to our discontinued operations  one customer was related to our it outsourcing services business segment  and one customer was indebted to the company as a result of a note receivable acquired with our acquisition of certain assets of cyntergy corporation in we are not aware of major financial difficulties at any major customer and do not anticipate large uncollectible accounts in the future 
however  ford s long term debt rating was lowered to below investment grade status by standard poor s rating services during  and was downgraded further on march   by fitch ratings services 
at this time  we do not expect this downgrade to negatively affect our business with ford or the collectibility of our accounts receivable from ford 
however  any bankruptcy filing by ford would have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable from ford and the company s operating results and liquidity 
goodwill impairment goodwill relating to our acquisitions represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired  and has a carrying amount of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in goodwill in was related to the acquisitions of sytel and akela in january and october  respectively 
we completed our annual impairment analyses at october  and  noting no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units 
at december   there have been no events or circumstances that would indicate an impairment test should be performed sooner than our annual test as of october  long lived assets and identifiable intangible asset impairment the carrying amount of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in was related to the acquisitions of sytel and akela in january and october  respectively 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived and identifiable intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balances may not be recoverable 
when factors or events indicate that such costs should be evaluated for possible impairment  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows of the assets over their remaining lives to evaluate whether the costs are recoverable 
such events could include  but are not limited to  the loss of a significant customer or contract  decreases in us federal government funding of certain programs  or other similar events 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that customization costs for certain software related to our help desk operations would not be utilized to deliver services to our customers or be used for any other purpose 
since we expected no future cash flows related to the customization  we recorded an impairment loss of  in our it outsourcing services operating segment  which represented the net book value of these costs 
we did not record an impairment loss in any other period presented 
business combinations we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  whereby the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair market value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price related to our business combinations involves significant estimates and management judgment that may be adjusted during the allocation period  but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date 
costs incurred related to successful business combinations are capitalized as costs of business combinations  while costs incurred by us for unsuccessful or terminated acquisition opportunities are expensed when we determine that such opportunities will no longer be pursued 
costs incurred related to probable business combinations are deferred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are subject to market exposure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not have any material market risk related to interest rates as our debt obligations have fixed interest rates 
we are subject to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to our global operations as we provide services in the united states and europe 
as a result  our financial results and position could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which we provide services 
our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and european currencies  specifically the european euro  british pound sterling  swedish kroner  and romanian lei 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge operating translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
also  certain of our trade receivables at our international subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the techteam entity that delivers the service 
as currency exchange rates change  our operating results will be affected by foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the receivable balance until it is collected 
we generally do not enter into derivatives or similar instruments to manage the company s exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates related to trade receivables 
however  in december  we entered into a foreign currency option contract for certain receivables 
under the option contract  we were entitled to sell an aggregate of  notional amount in monthly transactions through december  at our option  and purchase euros at a fixed exchange rate 
we did not purchase any euros under the contract during we do not enter into derivatives or similar instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december  and  our net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk were million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in net current assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be million and million at december  and  respectively 
approximately million and  of our trade receivables at our international subsidiaries at december  and  respectively  are denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the techteam entity that delivers the service 
the potential loss on trade receivables from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be  and  at december  and  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates yet exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency
