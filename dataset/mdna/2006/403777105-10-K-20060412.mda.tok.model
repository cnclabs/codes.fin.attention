general the gymboree corporation is a specialty retailer operating stores selling high quality apparel and accessories for children and women under the gymboree  janie and jack  and janeville brands  as well as play programs for children under the gymboree play music brand 
as of january   the company conducted its business through five primary divisions gymboree  gymboree outlet  janie and jack  janeville and gymboree play music 
as of january   we had stores  including stores in the united states including janie and jack shops  janeville stores and gymboree outlet stores and stores in canada 
the company also operates two on line stores at www 
gymboree 
com and www 
janieandjack 
com 
the company s net sales for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal and million in fiscal our net income totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal comparable store net sales which include on line stores  based on a week period  increased during fiscal versus  during fiscal versus  and during fiscal versus we expect that future increases in net sales and net income will be dependent on  among other factors  our ability to continue to reduce product costs while maintaining high quality standards  as well as our ability to attract new customers while maintaining existing customers longer in our core gymboree division 
sales growth will also be dependent on our ability to expand our three new growth concepts  janie and jack  janeville and gymboree outlet 
during  the company plans to open approximately new gymboree stores  new gymboree outlet stores and new janie and jack shops 
no new janeville stores are planned for fiscal the company also plans to remodel  relocate or expand approximately gymboree stores 
our long term growth will depend on the development and implementation of new retail concepts  such as janie and jack  janeville and gymboree outlet  as well as continued investment in our core retail brand  gymboree 
as such  we expect to continue to devote time and effort to evaluating  developing  and testing new concepts when we perceive opportunities in the marketplace 
such efforts inevitably require significant management attention at all phases of the process and  for those concepts that we determine to launch  significant capital expenditures and losses during the early years of operation 
the company s year end is on the saturday closest to january fiscal  and  which included weeks each  ended on january   january   and january   respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we identified our most critical accounting policies and estimates to be those related to inventory valuation  asset impairment  workers compensation  co branded credit card  revenue recognition and income taxes 

table of contents inventory valuation 
we review our inventory levels in order to identify slow moving merchandise and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and reduce prices to sell that merchandise 
the company takes a physical count of inventories in all stores and the distribution center once a year  and in some stores twice a year 
the company records an inventory shrink adjustment upon physical counts and also provides for estimated shrink adjustments for the period between the last physical inventory count and each balance sheet date 
our inventory shrink estimate can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrink trends 
effective february   the company elected to change its accounting method for inventory valuation from the retail method to the lower of cost or market method  determined on a weighted average basis the cost method 
the company believes the cost method is a preferable method for matching the cost of merchandise with the revenues generated 
asset impairment 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
decisions to close a store or facility can also result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
for locations to be closed which are under long term leases  we record a charge for lease buyout expense or the difference between our rent and the rate at which we expect to be able to sublease the properties and related cost  as appropriate 
most closures occur upon the lease expiration 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our experience  knowledge and occasionally third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors that are difficult to predict such as future store profitability  real estate demand and economic conditions 
workers compensation 
the company is partially self insured for workers compensation insurance 
the company records a liability based on actuarially determined amounts 
any actuarial projection of losses concerning our liability is subject to a high degree of variability due to external factors including future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
if the actual amount of claims filed exceeds our estimates  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
co branded credit card 
the company has co branded credit card agreements the agreements with a third party bank the bank and visa usa inc for the issuance of a visa credit card bearing the gymboree brand and administration of an associated incentive program for cardholders 
the program  which was launched in april  offers incentives to cardholders  including a discount on purchases from gymboree using the gymboree visa card and annual rewards in the form of a gymboree gift card equal to of total non gymboree purchases 
the bank is the sole owner of the accounts issued under the program and absorbs all losses associated with non payment by the cardholder and any fraudulent usage of the accounts by third parties 
the company is responsible for redeeming the incentives  including the issuance of any gift cards 
the bank pays fees to the company based on the number of credit card accounts opened and card usage and makes certain guaranteed minimum annual payments 
visa usa inc also pays fees to the company based on card usage 
cardholder incentives are funded from the fees paid by the bank to the company 
the company recognizes revenues related to the agreements as follows new account fees are recognized as retail revenues on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the credit card relationship  currently estimated to be years 
credit card usage fees are recognized as retail revenues as actual credit card usage occurs 
minimum guaranteed annual payments  which exceed amounts earned based on the number of accounts opened and card usage  are recognized as retail revenues on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the credit card relationship  currently estimated to be years 
annual rewards earned are recorded as gift card liabilities and recognized as retail revenues when the gift cards are redeemed 

table of contents revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized at the point of sale in retail stores 
on line revenue is recorded when the merchandise is delivered to the customer 
shipping fees received from customers are included in net sales and the associated shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 
the company also sells gift cards in its retail store locations and through its on line stores 
revenue is recognized in the period that the gift card is redeemed 
customers may earn gymbucks and redeem them for merchandise at a discount during the redemption period 
the company records a reserve for outstanding gymbucks if the earnings and redemption periods fall within different accounting periods 
sales are presented net of a sales return reserve  which is estimated based on historical return trends 
if actual returns exceed our estimates  additional sales returns may be recorded in the future 
for the play music operations  initial franchise and transfer fees for all sites sold in a territory are recognized as revenue when the franchisee has paid the initial franchise or transfer fee  in the form of cash and or a note payable  the franchisee has fully executed a franchise agreement and the company has substantially completed its obligations under such agreement 
the company receives royalties based on each domestic franchisee s gross receipts from operations and based on fees paid by international sub franchisees to the master franchisee 
such royalty fees are recorded when earned and are due from the franchisees days following the close of each quarter 
the company also recognizes revenues from consumer products sold to franchisees for resale at the time the products are shipped to the franchisees 
income taxes 
the company provides for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
the company is subject to periodic audits by the internal revenue service  and other taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain of the company s tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
loss and gain contingencies are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and may require significant management judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 
lease termination charge corporate headquarters 
in november  the company estimated the lease termination charge related to its former corporate headquarters in burlingame  california  based upon the difference between the terms of the original lease agreement which had been assumed by the company s landlord of its new corporate headquarters in san francisco  california and the estimated fair market value of a lease for similar property
