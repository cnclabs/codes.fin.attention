item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview we develop and distribute the fast forword family of reading intervention software 
our innovative products build learning capacity by vigorously and systematically applying neuroscience principles to improve the fundamental cognitive skills required to read and learn 
extensive outcomes research by independent researchers  our founding scientists  and our company demonstrates that the fast forword products help students attain rapid  lasting gains in the skills critical for reading 
to facilitate the use of our products  we offer a variety of on site and remote professional and technical services  as well as phone  email and web based support 
our primary market is k schools in the united states  to which we sell using a direct sales force 
for the twelve months ended december  and  k schools in the us accounted for and of booked sales  respectively 
from our inception to the end of december  approximately  schools in the us had purchased at least  of our fast forword product licenses and services  and during over  individuals enrolled in one of our products 
as of december  we had full time employees  compared to at december  business highlights the k education market is large 
according to the national center for education statistics  there are million k students with the number growing to nearly million in eduventures  a strategic consulting firm in the education industry  has estimated that in  k schools spent billion on supplemental content for all subject areas 
another market gauge  provided by the education market report s complete k newsletter july  estimated the market for all educational software at approximately million for the school year 
this represents growth of approximately over  compared to declining or flat sales in the years from to according to a recent survey by the national conference of state legislatures  state budget conditions continue to improve 
state budget overruns are declining  although states still report increasing spending demands for medicaid and other health care programs  corrections  education and other priorities 
among the federal education programs  we believe that title and idea special education have been the most significant sources of funds for purchases of fast forword licenses 
the federal appropriations for these programs are at approximately the same level as in the current federal budget deficit and competing priorities  however  may impact the continuing availability of federal education funding 
the federal no child left behind nclb act of established reading achievement  grade level proficiency  and accountability through assessment as important national priorities 
nclb also emphasizes the need to use proven practices and products grounded in scientifically based research to improve student performance 
our products align well with the emphases of nclb  and we believe that this alignment assists us in marketing and selling our products 
company highlights in total booked sales declined compared to as k booked sales were down 
this compares to a booked sales increase of in compared to we attribute our booked sales decline to our earlier sales focus on very large transactions in urban districts  which are extremely unpredictable  as well as to increased caution among buyers  which extended our selling cycle 
in addition  funding uncertainty in texas  one of our key states  and sales management issues in our southwest region also contributed to the booked sales decline 
during  we closed a major contract with the school district of philadelphia  with a total contract price of million  of which million was recorded as booked sales in an additional million was recorded as booked sales in and the remainder of the contract is scheduled to be booked over the next three calendar years 
the school district of philadelphia transaction represented a major expansion of an existing customer 
we had no transactions of similar size in one of our major goals continues to be increasing the number of large booked sales  typically expansions of existing implementations  which we believe to be an important indicator of mainstream education industry acceptance and an important factor in the productivity of our sales force 
in  we closed transactions in excess of  page compared to in and in larger booked sales tend to have a longer sales cycle and involve a more complex decision process 
increases in the proportion of our business from these large booked sales may cause increased fluctuations and unpredictability in the timing of our booked sales and revenue 
as discussed before  the characteristics of our public school market cause us to have a somewhat long and unpredictable sales cycle 
during  we saw educational decision makers grow more cautious in their decision making  which led to the lengthening our sales cycle 
in our revenue grew over to million 
this revenue growth was in contrast to a decline in booked sales 
the divergence of booked sales and revenue is primarily attributable to our december pricing change which has resulted in a higher proportion of booked sales being recognized as revenue up front 
as a result of this pricing change  we now recognize revenue for most sales of perpetual licenses at delivery  rather than ratably over the related support period 
in  therefore  we recognized substantial revenue both from sales booked in and and from sales booked in historically  booked sales have been greater than revenue 
in booked sales were million and revenue was million 
due primarily to the december pricing change  was unusual booked sales were million and revenue was million 
in we expect revenue to decline as compared to primarily as a result of our december pricing change  we began with significantly less current deferred revenue than at the beginning of we expect that in we will recognize substantially less perpetual license revenue from prior years booked sales than we did in and prior years 
we also expect that we will return to our historical pattern of booked sales exceeding revenue  and deferred revenue therefore growing during the year 
we reported net income of million in  compared to net loss of million in this net income results from higher revenues more than offsetting expense increases in employee compensation  consulting  travel  marketing  legal and audit 
additionally  incentive compensation and commissions decreased from the prior year due to the decrease in booked sales 
we expect to report a net loss in  partly because of the implementation of fas r 
we ended with million in cash and short term investments  and with no debt 
we did not make use of our credit line during net cash used in operating activities was million 
this negative cash flow from operations was the first since and was the result of the decreased booked sales 
results of operations revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands change change products  service and support  total revenues  revenue compared to the increase in product revenue primarily reflected our december pricing change that eliminated the initial license fee for our progress tracker online product 
this change in our pricing structure resulted in a far higher proportion of booked sales from the current period being recognized into revenue than during the comparable periods in for the year ended december   approximately million  or  of total booked sales were recognized as revenue in the quarter in which the sale occurred 
for the comparable periods in  a negligible amount of booked sales was recognized into revenue in the quarter of sale 
our december strategic pricing change had little impact in  because the software for many december perpetual licenses was not delivered until january the impact on january revenue from products shipped in december was approximately million 
service and support revenues continued to increase  primarily due to increased sales of on site services 
service and support revenue also increased as a result of the increase in the number of schools purchasing ongoing progress tracker access and support revenue compared to the decline in product revenue compared to was largely attributable to only modest growth in booked sales coupled with a shift in sales mix in towards multi year contracts with page longer revenue recognition periods 
during and  the majority of our product license sales were initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized to revenue over the support term 
because the support term frequently crosses over two fiscal years  our license sales affected product revenue in both and product revenue in was also negatively affected by more volume discounts due to an increasing proportion of large sales in and service and support revenues increased  primarily due to increased sales of on site services 
service and support revenue also increased as a result of the increase in the number of schools purchasing ongoing progress tracker access and support contracts 
future revenue as a result of our december strategic pricing change  during we recognized current booked sales from perpetual licenses into revenue substantially more quickly than we did in see revenue recognition below for more detail about our revenue recognition policies 
at the same time  we have continued to recognize deferred revenue from prior years perpetual license sales 
as a result of this non recurring impact from our transition to a different pricing structure  we expect revenue to decline in booked sales and selling activity booked sales is a non gaap financial measure that management uses to evaluate current selling activity 
we believe that booked sales is a useful metric for investors as well as management because it is the most direct measure of current demand for our products and services 
booked sales equals the total value net of allowances of software  services and support invoiced in the period 
revenue on a gaap basis is recorded for booked sales when all four of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met  if not  the sale is booked to deferred revenue 
we use booked sales information for resource allocation  planning  compensation and other management purposes 
we believe that revenue is the most comparable gaap measure to booked sales 
however  booked sales should not be considered in isolation from revenues  and is not intended to represent a substitute measure of revenues or any other performance measure calculated under gaap 
the following reconciliation table sets forth our booked sales  revenues and change in deferred revenue for the twelve months ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands change change booked sales    less revenue    net increase decrease in deferred revenue   total deferred revenue end of period   booked sales in the k sector  which accounted for of booked sales in  declined to million  compared to million in booked sales in the k sector were million in we sold site license packages over  in  compared to  in the same period in and in we believe that the principal reasons for our decline in booked sales are to our earlier sales focus on very large transactions in urban districts  which are extremely unpredictable  as well as to increased caution among buyers  which extended our selling cycle 
in addition  funding uncertainty in texas  one of our key states  and sales management issues in our southwest region also contributed to the booked sales decline we believe large booked sales are an important indicator of mainstream education industry acceptance and an important factor in reaching our goal of increasing sales force productivity 
in we continued to focus our sales force on multi site sales 
the number of booked sales over  declined to in from in and in for the twelve months ended december   of our k booked sales were realized from sales over  for the comparable periods ending december  and  large booked sales accounted for and of booked sales respectively 
both and included large transactions with the school district of philadelphia 
the transaction was million  with million booked in and another million booked in the remaining million is scheduled to be recorded as booked sales in the coming three years 
large booked sales include volume discounts but the percentage discount applicable to any given transaction will vary and the relative percentage of large sales and smaller sales in a given quarter may fluctuate 
because we discount product license fees but do not discount service and support fees  product booked sales and revenue are disproportionately affected by discounting 
we cannot predict the size  number and timing of large transactions in the future 
page booked sales outside the k market primarily private practice clinicians and international customers increased by in  compared to a increase in over we believe we have stabilized our booked sales to this market and expect to hold near the current level in and may even experience modest growth due to increased booked sales to international customers 
our primary focus remains the us k market 
although federal  state and local budget pressures make for an uncertain funding environment for our customers  we remain optimistic about our growth prospects in the k market 
however  achieving our booked sales growth objectives will depend on increasing customer acceptance of our products  which requires us to continue to focus on improving our products ease of use  their fit with school requirements  and our connection with classroom teachers and administrators 
our k growth prospects are also influenced by factors outside our control including the overall level  certainty and allocation of state  local and federal funding 
for a discussion of some of the other important factors that affect our results  see risk factors 
in addition  the revenue recognized from our booked sales can be unpredictable 
our various license and service packages have substantially differing revenue recognition periods  and it is often difficult to predict which license package a customer will purchase  even when the amount and timing of a sale can be reasonably projected 
see management s discussion and analysis application of critical accounting policies for a discussion of our revenue recognition policy 
in addition  the timing of a single large order or its implementation can significantly impact the level of booked sales and revenue at any given time 
gross profit and cost of revenues year ended december  dollars in thousands gross profit on products    gross profit margin on products gross profit on service and support    gross profit margin on services and support total gross profit    total gross profit margin the overall gross profit margin improved in compared to  as margin improved in both products and services and support 
revenue mix in was only slightly different from  as we had of revenues from products in  versus in and in the remainder of revenues in each year was from services and support 
the overall gross profit margin declined in compared to  as margin improvements in both products and services and support were more than offset by revenue mix changes 
in  we expect that product revenues will comprise a lower percentage of revenues than in either or as a result of the revenue mix shift  in we expect slightly lower overall gross profit margins than in service and support margins have improved over the past three years as we have increased the sales of services to our customers  significantly increased progress tracker revenues and maintained our support base 
due to the semi fixed cost nature of services and support  revenue growth has resulted in margin improvement 
product costs consist of manufacturing  packaging and fulfillment costs  amortization of capitalized software and royalties 
product margin improvement of for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period in  was due to improvement in materials and fulfillment  the amortization of software development costs  partially offset by an increase in royalties 
product margins in were better than in  as improvements in royalties and the amortization of software development were only partially offset by rising materials and fulfillment costs 
operating expenses year ended december  dollars in thousands change change sales and marketing    research and development    general and administrative    restructuring n a n a total operating expenses    page sales and marketing in  our sales and marketing expenses increased due to increased sales and marketing staff and marketing activities  partially offset by commissions and incentive compensation which were  or million  lower than in as a result of lower booked sales 
in  our sales and marketing expenses increased primarily due to increased sales and marketing staff  more marketing activities and higher commissions reflecting higher booked sales 
sales and marketing expenses consist principally of salaries and incentive compensation paid to employees engaged in sales and marketing activities  travel costs  tradeshows  conferences  and marketing and promotional materials 
at december   we had field based quota bearing sales personnel selling to public schools  compared to and at december  and respectively 
we expect to continue to add sales people during and to continue to invest in marketing activities 
research and development research and development expenses increased in due primarily to compensation expenses related to additional staff 
research and development expenses increased in compared to  but decreased as a percentage of revenue 
research and development expenses principally consist of compensation paid to employees and consultants engaged in research and product development activities and product testing  together with software and equipment costs 
we expect research and development expenses to stabilize in even as we continue to invest in improving our current product suite  demonstrating product efficacy and introducing new products 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to additional accounting staff and audit and tax fees  partially offset by a decline in incentive compensation 
general and administrative expenses increased in over primarily due to the expenses associated with the restatement of our financial results and to the addition of staff 
accounting and legal fees associated with the restatement that were expensed in totaled approximately  general and administrative expenses principally consist of salaries and compensation paid to our executives  accounting staff and other support personnel  as well as travel expenses for these employees  and outside legal and accounting fees 
stock based compensation we are required to implement sfas r beginning january  this will require us to record compensation expense for employee stock awards 
we expect that the implementation of sfas r will significantly increase our operating expenses 
restructuring in october we entered into a lease termination agreement with our landlord to terminate the lease on our oakland headquarters and entered into a new lease agreement for a reduced amount of space in the same building 
compared to the prior lease  the reduction in space is expected to reduce future lease payments by million net of lease termination fees described below through under the lease termination agreement we paid an increased security deposit of  and lease termination fees totaling  in the balance of the lease termination fees of million was paid in and all restructuring expenses have been paid as of december  no payments of previously expensed restructuring charges or new restructuring charges occurred in other income from related party in september  we signed an agreement with posit science corporation psc  transferring our patented technology to psc for use in the health field 
during the twelve months ended december   and we recorded   and  respectively  for royalties received and services provided to psc 
amounts received to date and any future receipts are being reported as other income as we do not consider these royalties to be part of our recurring operations 
interest expense  net year ended december  dollars in thousands change change interest income expense  net interest income expense  net  increased in as a result of no borrowings or deferred financing amortization and substantial cash balances during we received interest on our cash balances and on our outstanding officer loans 
the amortization of deferred financing was completed in the third quarter of interest expense decreased in  compared to deferred financing costs were fully amortized in the quarter ended september  deferred financing expense was  in compared to million in page income tax provision benefit we have recorded a tax provision of  for the year ended december  the tax provision principally consists of federal and state taxes currently payable offset by the utilization of net operating losses resulting in an effective tax rate of 
we recorded a tax benefit of  for the year ended december  relating to the reversal of a provision for us federal alternative minimum tax for the year ended december  at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
unutilized net operating loss carryforwards will expire in the years through utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations 
previous or future equity transactions may result in such an ownership change 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before they become available to reduce future tax liabilities 
at december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets  comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and previously reported net losses  at december  we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our remaining net deferred tax assets as they are not yet realizable 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared to million at december  and million at december  during  we used cash from operating activities of million compared to and when we generated cash from operations of million and million  respectively 
at december  there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit line 
net cash used by operations in was million  compared to cash generated by operations of million in and million in net cash used in operating activities declined in due to lower booked sales and higher expenses 
overall  our receivable collection experience remained strong 
there were no payments for previously expensed restructuring charges for the twelve months ended december  for the comparable period in the payments for previously expensed restructuring charges were million 
net cash generated by investing activities in was million  consisting of the purchase of hardware and software of million and the purchase of million of short term investments  which were more than offset by the repayment of million of officer loans 
net cash used in investing activities in was million and in was million  both consisting of the purchase of computer hardware and software 
we intend to make systems investments in financing activities generated million in  compared to million in  each from the sale of stock upon option exercises and through purchases of stock through the employee stock purchase plan 
in  the sale of stock was offset by the repayment of million  net  on our credit line 
in  we borrowed and repaid million  resulting in no net activity 
there was no borrowing on our credit line in because our booked sales tend to be seasonal  we may have negative cash flows in particular quarters  particularly the first quarter  when booked sales tend to be substantially lower than in other quarters 
we borrowed money for working capital purposes in the first quarter of and may borrow again from time to time 
no funds were borrowed in we have a line of credit with comerica bank totaling million which expires june  the line is subject to limitations based on our quick ratio and tangible net worth 
borrowings under the line are subject to various covenants  which may limit our financial and operating flexibility 
there was no borrowing outstanding under the line at december  and we have no current intentions of borrowing any funds 
at december  we were in compliance with all our covenants 
we expect that cash flow from operations will continue to be our primary source of funds for the next several years 
again  this will require us to achieve certain levels of booked sales 
if we are unable to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow from operations  we may seek other sources of debt or equity financing  or may be required to reduce expenses 
reducing our expenses could adversely affect our operations by reducing the resources available page for sales  marketing  research or development efforts 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commitments we have a non cancelable lease agreement for our corporate office facilities 
the minimum lease payment is approximately  per month through after the base lease payment increases at a compound annual rate of approximately 
the lease expires in december we also make royalty payments to individuals and institutions who participated in the original research that produced our initial products 
our minimum royalty payments are  per year 
the following table summarizes our obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
dollars in thousands total less than year years years thereafter non cancelable operating leases    minimum royalty payments  total      our purchase order commitments at december  are not material 
loans to current and former officers in march we made full recourse loans to certain of our officers  in amounts totaling million 
in some of these officers left our company 
the notes are full recourse loans secured by shares of our common stock owned by the current and former officers 
the loans bear interest at 
principal and interest were due december  during the twelve months ended december  we received million in loan repayments  including interest 
at december  there was a remaining balance due of  this represents principal and interest from one of the former officers 
subsequent to december   we received the balance due in the form of cash and stock 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  assumptions and judgments 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments that we make can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial statements would be affected 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments pertaining to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts are the most critical assumptions to understand in order to evaluate our reported financial results 
a detailed discussion of our use of estimates  assumptions and judgments as they relate to these polices is presented below 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of licenses to our software and from service and support fees 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position sop 
sop provides specific industry guidance and four basic criteria  which must be met to recognize revenue 
these are persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  page delivery of the product has occurred  a fixed or determinable fee  and the probability that the fee will be collected 
the application of sop requires us to exercise significant judgment related to our specific transactions and transaction types 
sales to our school customers typically include multiple elements eg  fast forword software licenses  progress tracker  our internet based participant tracking service  support  training  implementation management  and other services 
we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined in reliance on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if vsoe exists for each element 
if we do not have vsoe for one or more delivered elements in an arrangement typically software  we recognize revenue using the residual method  whereby the difference between the total arrangement fee and the total fair value of the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue relating to the delivered elements 
vsoe of fair value for each element of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is also measured by the renewal price 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
the value of software licenses  services and support invoiced during a particular period is recorded as deferred revenue until recognized 
all revenue from transactions that include new products that have not yet been delivered is deferred until the delivery of all products 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue as discussed below 
product revenue product revenue is primarily derived from the licensing of software and is recognized as follows perpetual licenses software licensed on a perpetual basis 
revenue is recognized at the later of product delivery date or contract start date using the residual method 
if vsoe does not exist for all the undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period if the undelivered element is services or when all elements have been delivered 
term licenses software licensed for a specific time period  generally three to twelve months 
revenue is recognized ratably over the license term 
individual participant licenses software licensed for a single participant 
revenue is recognized over the average period of use  typically six weeks 
service and support revenue service and support revenue is derived from a combination of training  implementation  technical and professional services  online services and customer support 
training  technical and other professional services are typically sold on a per day basis 
if vsoe exists for all elements of an arrangement or all elements except software licenses  services revenue is recognized as performed 
if vsoe does not exist for all the elements in an arrangement except software licenses  service revenue is recognized over the longest contractual period in an arrangement 
revenue from services sold alone or with support is recognized as performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses due to the inability of customers to make payments 
we adjust this allowance periodically based on our historical experience of bad debt write offs  which have been low in recent years 
cancellations and refunds are allowed in limited circumstances  and such amounts have not been significant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the rate of interest we will pay on our revolving credit facility with comerica bank 
interest rates on loans extended under that facility are at a floating prime rate  or a fixed rate of libor plus 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the market interest rates at december  would not have a material affect on our results of operations
