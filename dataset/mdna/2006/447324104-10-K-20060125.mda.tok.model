item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview hurco companies  inc is an industrial technology company operating in a single segment 
we design and produce computerized machine tools  featuring our proprietary computer control systems and software  for sale through our own distribution network to the worldwide metal cutting market 
we also provide software options  control upgrades  accessories and replacement parts for our products  as well as customer service and training support 
our computerized metal cutting machine tools are manufactured in taiwan to our specifications by our wholly owned subsidiary  hurco manufacturing limited hml  and an affiliate 
we sell our products through approximately independent agents and distributors in approximately countries throughout north america  europe and asia 
we also have our own direct sales and service organizations in england  france  germany  italy  singapore and china 
the primary drivers of our improved performance in the last three years are improved worldwide demand for our products  our expanded product line and the impact of changes in foreign currency 
the machine tool industry is highly cyclical and changes in demand can occur abruptly 
there was a significant decline in global demand that continued through the fourth quarter of fiscal during the downturn  we took actions to discontinue the production and sale of underperforming products  refocused on our core product lines and significantly reduced our operating costs 
we also began introducing new product models in late fiscal and have continued this process since then 
our new models  together with an increase in worldwide demand for machine tools  are largely responsible for the continuing increase in our sales during the last two fiscal years 
approximately of worldwide demand for machine tools comes from outside the united states 
during fiscal and  approximately two thirds of our sales and service fees were attributable to customers located abroad 
our sales to foreign customers are denominated  and payments by those customers are made  in the prevailing currencies primarily the euro and pound sterling in the countries in which those customers are located  and our product costs are incurred and paid primarily in the new taiwan dollar and us dollars 
changes in currency exchange rates can have a material effect on our operating results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles 
for example  when a foreign currency increases in value relative to the us dollar  sales made and expenses incurred in that currency  when translated to us dollars for reporting in our financial statements  are higher than would be the case when that currency has a lower value relative to the us dollar 
in our comparison of period to period results  we discuss not only the increases or decreases in those results as reported in our financial statements which reflect translation to us dollars at prevailing exchange rates  but also the effect that changes in exchange rates had on those results 
our high levels of foreign manufacturing and sales also subject us to cash flow risks due to fluctuating currency exchange rates 
we seek to mitigate those risks through the use of various hedging instruments principally foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
the volatility of demand for machine tools can significantly impact our working capital requirements and  therefore  our cash flow from operations and our operating profits 
because our products are manufactured in taiwan  manufacturing and ocean transportation lead times require that we schedule machine tool production based on forecasts of customer orders for a future period of four or five months 
we continually monitor order activity levels and adjust future production schedules to reflect changes in demand  but a significant unexpected decline in customer orders from forecasted levels can temporarily increase our finished goods inventories and our use of working capital 
results of operations the following table presents  for the fiscal years indicated  selected items from the consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of worldwide sales and service fees and the year to year percentage changes in the dollar amounts of those items 
percentage of revenues year to year change increase decrease vs 
vs 
sales and service fees gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring expense and other expenses  net n a n a operating income interest expense net income fiscal compared with fiscal sales and service fees sales and service fees for fiscal were the highest in our year history  totaling million  an increase of million  or  over fiscal  of which million was attributable to operational growth and approximately million was due to the effects of translating foreign sales to us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
computerized machine tool sales  which also were the highest in our history  totaled million  an increase of from the million recorded in  primarily driven by strong worldwide demand for our existing products 
approximately million  or  of the increase in sales of computerized machine tools was the result of sales of our new lathe machine line  which was introduced in december net sales and service fees by geographic region the following table sets forth net sales and service fees by geographic region for the years ended october  and in thousands october  increase amount americas europe asia pacific total in the americas  sales and service fees increased million  or  due primarily to the growth of our vmx signature product line and sales of the lathe product line 
shipments of vmx units increased in fiscal compared to fiscal while shipments of our more moderately priced vm product line increased during that same period 
unit shipments of vertical machining centers which exclude lathes increased approximately in fiscal compared to for similar products in the united states as reported by the association for manufacturing technology 
in europe  our sales and service fees increased by million  or  as a result of increased unit sales and the favorable effect of stronger european currencies 
approximately million  or  of the increase in our sales and service fees was attributable to changes in currency exchange rates 
the increase in sales and service fees was consistent in all of our european markets 
sales and service fees in the asia pacific region were not significantly affected by currency rates  but did reflect improved activity in asian markets 
net sales and service fees by product category the following table sets forth net sales and service fees by product category for years ended october  and in thousands october  increase amount computerized machine tools service fees  parts and other total sales of computerized machine tools totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  of which million was attributable to the favorable effects of currency translation 
unit shipments of computerized machine tools increased  fueled by a increase in shipments of products in the vmx product line and the release of the lathe product line 
the average net selling price per unit of computerized machine tool models increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  as a result of a greater number of units of higher priced vmx models in the total product mix 
the average net selling price per unit  when measured in local currencies  was substantially unchanged 
orders and backlog 
new order bookings for fiscal totaled million  an increase of million  or  as compared to million recorded in fiscal the increase in orders was attributable primarily to the vmx and lathe product lines 
unit orders for the vmx product line increased by in fiscal compared to the prior year  while unit orders of the vm product increased during that same period 
orders were strong at all hurco locations in fiscal and unit orders increased  and in north america  europe and asia pacific  respectively 
approximately million  or  of the increase was attributable to changes in currency exchange rates 
backlog was million at october  compared to million at october  we do not believe backlog is a useful measure of past performance or indicative of future performance 
as a result  we will not disclose backlog in future sec filings 
gross margin 
gross margin for fiscal was  an increase over the margin realized in the corresponding period  due principally to the increased sales volume 
operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million increased million  or  from those of fiscal the increase was primarily due to a million increase in sales and marketing expenditures  a million increase in general and administrative expenses  a  increase in product development spending  a  increase in european agents commissions and a  increase from the translation of foreign currencies to us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal totaled million  or of sales  compared to million or of sales  in the prior year 
operating income in fiscal was net of a  severance charge 
other income expense 
other income expense  net in fiscal relates primarily to currency exchange losses on inter company receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies  net of gains or losses on related forward contracts 
provision benefit for income taxes 
at the end of fiscal  we had deferred tax assets of approximately million that were primarily attributable to net operating losses and tax credits in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
because of the highly cyclical nature of our industry  competitive pressures that could impact pricing and the risks associated with new product introductions  we believed there was uncertainty as to the future realization of the benefits from these deferred tax assets and  therefore  we maintained a valuation allowance against those assets 
during fiscal  due to the substantial improvement in our operating results  especially in the fourth quarter of the year  we utilized approximately million of the net operating loss carryforwards  all of which were subject to a valuation allowance 
after examining a number of factors  including our operating results for fiscal  and particularly the fourth quarter of the year  which exceeded our internal projections  and our projections of near term future operating results  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would ultimately realize the benefits of all our remaining domestic deferred tax assets and a significant portion of our foreign deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we reduced our remaining valuation allowance to  all of which related to foreign net operating losses for which there remains uncertainty as to the future realization of the related tax benefits 
as a result of our utilization in fiscal of net operating losses against which we had previously maintained a valuation allowance and the reduction of all but  of the valuation allowance on our remaining deferred tax assets at the end of fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million  which is net of approximately million recorded as additional paid in capital for the tax effects of the exercise by employees of stock options during both fiscal and the fiscal income tax provision  excluding the recorded tax benefit of million  was million compared to million in fiscal net income 
net income for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in the prior year 
the improvement in net income was primarily due to a substantial increase in sales of our computerized machine tools  improved gross margin and a favorable tax benefit partially offset by an increase in operating expenses 
fiscal compared with fiscal net income for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to  or 
per share in the prior year 
the improvement in net income was primarily due to a substantial increase in sales of our computerized machine tools  which was attributable to demand for our newer models introduced in and  and improving market conditions  and also reflected the benefit of stronger european currencies in relation to the us dollar 
we introduced the vm product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal to improve our competitiveness in the entry level machining center market 
the vm product line has been successful in both the domestic and international markets 
in the united states  we believe we have an approximate market share in the entry level machining center market 
in fiscal and  we shipped and vm units  respectively  worldwide  which resulted in approximately million and million  respectively  of incremental computerized machine tool sales 
our operating results for fiscal were favorably impacted by further strengthening of foreign currencies  particularly the euro  in relation to the us dollar  when translating foreign sales and service fees into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
as noted in the following table  approximately of our net sales and service fees in fiscal were derived from european markets 
the weighted average exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro during fiscal was  as compared to for fiscal  an increase of 
net sales and service fees by geographic region the following tables set forth net sales and service fees by geographic region for the years ended october  and in thousands october  increase amount americas europe asia pacific total total sales and service fees on a worldwide basis were million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  a million  or  increase 
however  million  or  of the increase in total sales and service fees was due to changes in currency exchange rates 
in the americas  sales and service fees increased million  or  due primarily to the continued growth of the vm product line 
shipments of vm units increased in fiscal compared to fiscal while shipments of our higher priced vmx product line increased during that same period 
the increase in our sales and service fees in the united states reflects a increase in unit orders for our vertical machining centers in fiscal compared to fiscal that percentage increase was substantially greater than the industry wide increase of for unit orders for vertical machining centers in the united states  as reported by the association for manufacturing technology 
in europe  our sales and service fees increased by million  or  as a result of increased unit sales and the favorable effect of stronger european currencies 
approximately million  or  of the increase in our sales and service fees was attributable to changes in currency exchange rates 
sales and service fees in the asia pacific region were not significantly affected by currency rates  but did reflect improved activity in asian markets 
net sales and service fees by product category the following table sets forth net sales and service fees by product category for years ended october  and in thousands october  increase amount computerized machine tools service fees  parts and other total hurco established new records for computerized machine tool sales and new order bookings in fiscal sales of computerized machine tools totaled million  an increase of million  or  of which million was attributable to the favorable effects of currency translation 
unit shipments of computerized machine tools increased  fueled by a increase in shipments of products in the vm product line 
the average net selling price per unit of computerized machine tool models was substantially unchanged in fiscal compared to fiscal  notwithstanding the disproportionate increase in shipments of our lower priced vm models  due primarily to the beneficial effects of currency translation 
however  the average net selling price per unit  measured in local currencies  declined approximately due primarily to the greater portion of those vm products in the total product mix 
new order bookings for fiscal totaled  an increase of million  or  as compared to million recorded in fiscal approximately million  or of the increase  was attributable to changes in currency exchange rates 
the increase in constant us dollars was attributable primarily to orders for the vm product line 
unit orders for the vm product line increased by in fiscal compared to the prior year  while unit orders of the vmx product increased during that same period 
backlog was million at october  compared to million at october  gross margin for fiscal was  an increase over the margin realized in the corresponding period  due principally to increased sales volume and the favorable effects of stronger european currencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million increased million  or  from those of the corresponding period primarily due to currency translation effects  increased commissions to european selling agents associated with the increase in european sales and increased sales and marketing expenditures 
operating income for fiscal totaled million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in the prior year 
operating income in fiscal was net of a  one time severance charge 
variable option expense of  is related to certain stock options  which were subject to variable plan accounting as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these stock options have all been exercised so no additional variable option expense is expected 
other income expense  net  in fiscal includes currency exchange losses on inter company receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies  net of gains or losses on related forward contracts  profits of subsidiaries accounted for using the equity method  and other non operating income and expense items 
the provision for income taxes is related to the earnings of two foreign subsidiaries 
in the united states and certain other foreign jurisdictions  we have net operating loss carryforwards for which we have a valuation reserve at october  because the significant size of those carry forwards relative to our current rate of earnings creates uncertainty about the realization of the tax benefits in future years 
the provision for income tax increased in fiscal solely because of increased earnings from our taxable foreign subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources at october   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at october  cash generated from operations totaled million and million at october  and  respectively 
we also generated cash of approximately  and million in fiscal and  respectively  from the sale of common stock to employees upon the exercise of common stock options 
working capital  excluding cash and short term debt  was million at october  compared to million at october  accounts receivable increased by million in fiscal due to the increase in sales and deferred tax assets increased by due to the reversal of the valuation allowance 
we expect our operating working capital requirements to increase in fiscal as our sales and service fees increase 
we expect to fund any such increase with cash flow from operations and borrowings under our bank credit facilities 
capital investments during the year consisted of an integrated computer system and normal expenditures for software development projects and purchases of equipment 
we funded these expenditures with cash flow from operations 
total debt at october  was million representing of total capitalization  which aggregated million  compared to million  or of total capitalization  at october  we believe that cash flow from operations and borrowings available to us under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements in fiscal contractual obligations and commitments the following is a table of contractual obligations and commitments as of october  all amounts in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases deferred credits and other total in addition to the contractual obligations and commitments disclosed above  we also have a variety of other obligations for the procurement of materials and services  none of which subject us to any material non cancellable commitments 
while some of these obligations arise under long term supply agreements  we are not committed under these agreements to accept or pay for requirements that are not needed to meet our production needs 
we have no material minimum purchase commitments or take or pay type agreements or arrangements 
with respect to capital expenditures  we expect capital spending in fiscal  exclusive of capitalized software development costs  to be approximately million  which includes discretionary items 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  our european subsidiaries guarantee third party lease financing residuals in connection with the sale of certain machines in europe 
at october   we had outstanding third party guarantees totaling approximately million 
a retention of title clause allows our european subsidiaries to repossess a machine that is the subject of a lease guarantee if the customer defaults on its lease 
we believe that the proceeds obtained from liquidation of the machine would cover any payments required by the guarantee 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies  including those described below  require management to make significant estimates and assumptions using information available at the time the estimates are made 
such estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
if our future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions  our results of operations and financial condition could be affected 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of our machine tool systems upon delivery of the product to the customer  which is normally at the time of shipment  because persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in certain foreign locations  we retain title after shipment under a retention of title clause solely to protect collectibility 
the retention of title is similar to ucc filings in the united states and provides the creditor with additional rights to the machine if the customer fails to pay 
revenue recognition at the time of shipment is appropriate in this instance as long as all risks of ownership have passed to the buyer 
our computerized machine tools are general purpose computer controlled machine tools that are typically used in stand alone operations 
transfer of ownership and risk of loss are not contingent upon contractual customer acceptance 
prior to shipment  we test each machine to ensure the machine s compliance with standard operating specifications as listed in our sales literature 
depending upon geographic location  after shipment a machine may be installed at the customer s facilities by a distributor  independent contractor or hurco service technician 
in most instances where a machine is sold through a distributor  hurco has no installation involvement 
if sales are direct or through sales agents  hurco will typically complete the machine installation  which consists of the reassembly of certain parts that were removed for shipping and the re testing of the machine to ensure that it is performing within the standard specifications 
we consider the machine installation process to be inconsequential and perfunctory 
service fees from maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized in earnings on a pro rata basis over the term of the contract 
sales related to software products are recognized when shipped in conformity with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position software revenue recognition 
the software does not require production  modification or customization and at the time of shipment persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
inventories we determine at each balance sheet date how much  if any  of our inventory may ultimately prove to be unsaleable or unsaleable at its carrying cost 
reserves are established to effectively adjust the carrying value of such inventory to net realizable value 
to determine the appropriate level of valuation reserves  we evaluate current stock levels in relation to historical and expected patterns of demand for all of our products 
management evaluates the need for changes to valuation reserves based on market conditions  competitive offerings and other factors on a regular basis 
deferred tax asset valuation as of october   we have deferred tax assets of million for which we have recorded  valuation allowance 
these deferred tax assets relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  as well as federal business tax credits carried forward in the united states 
the benefit of some of these carryforwards expires at certain dates and utilization of certain others is limited to specific amounts each year 
realization of those benefits is entirely dependent upon generating sufficient future taxable earnings in the specific tax jurisdictions before the carryforwards expire 
we regularly evaluate the realization of these benefits to determine if it is more likely than not that we will realize all of our net deferred tax assets 
capitalized software development costs costs incurred to develop new computer software products and significant enhancements to software features of existing products are capitalized as required by sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  and amortized over the estimated product life of the related software 
the determination as to when in the product development cycle technological feasibility has been established  and the expected product life  require judgments and estimates by management and can be affected by technological developments  innovations by competitors and changes in market conditions affecting demand 
we capitalized million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and  in fiscal related to software development projects 
at october  we have an asset of million for capitalized software development projects  a significant portion of which relates to projects currently in process and subject to development risk and market acceptance 
we periodically review the carrying values of these assets and make judgments as to ultimate realization considering the above mentioned risk factors 
derivative financial instruments critical aspects of our accounting policy for derivative financial instruments include conditions that require that critical terms of a hedging instrument are essentially the same as a hedged forecasted transaction 
another important element of our policy demands that formal documentation be maintained as required by the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
failure to comply with these conditions would result in a requirement to recognize changes in market value of hedge instruments in earnings 
we routinely monitor significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments associated with derivative instruments  and compliance with formal documentation requirements 
stock compensation we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations in accounting for the plans  and  except for certain shares subject to variable plan accounting  no compensation expense has been recognized for stock options issued under the plans 
for companies electing to continue the use of apb no 
 sfas no 
r accounting for stock based compensation  requires pro forma disclosures determined through the use of an option pricing model as if the provisions of sfas no 
r had been adopted 
we intend to adopt sfas r on november  using the prospective method 
we believe that the adoption of sfas r will not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate risk we had no borrowings outstanding under our bank credit facilities at october  and have not borrowed from our bank credit facilities since february our only debt at october  is a first mortgage loan with a fixed interest rate of 
as a result  a one percentage point increase in our variable borrowing interest rate would have had an immaterial impact on our fiscal results 
interest expense would have increased by approximately  in fiscal as a result of the same increase in interest rates 
note of the consolidated financial statements sets forth the interest rates related to our current credit facilities 
foreign currency exchange risk in fiscal  approximately two thirds of our sales and service fees  including export sales  were derived from foreign markets 
all of our computerized machine tools and computer control systems  as well as certain proprietary service parts  are sourced by our us based engineering and manufacturing division and re invoiced to our foreign sales and service subsidiaries  primarily in their functional currencies 
our products are sourced from foreign suppliers or built to our specifications by either our wholly owned subsidiary in taiwan  or overseas contract manufacturers 
these purchases are predominantly in foreign currencies and in some cases our arrangements with these suppliers include foreign currency risk sharing agreements  which reduce but do not eliminate the effects of currency fluctuations on product costs 
the predominant portion of our exchange rate risk associated with product purchases relates to the new taiwan dollar 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts from time to time to hedge the cash flow risk related to forecasted inter company sales and forecasted inter company and third party purchases denominated in  or based on  foreign currencies primarily the euro  pound sterling and new taiwan dollar 
we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not speculate in the financial markets and  therefore  do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes 
forward contracts for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies as of october  which are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
were as follows notional amount weighted avg
