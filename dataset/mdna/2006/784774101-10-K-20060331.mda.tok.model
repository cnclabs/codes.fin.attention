overview simpletech  inc designs  develops  manufactures and markets custom and open standard memory solutions based on flash memory and dram technologies and external storage solutions 
headquartered in santa ana  california  we specialize in developing high density dram memory modules and high speed  high capacity solid state flash drives and memory cards used in sensitive and highly volatile environments 
we sell our products through our consumer and oem divisions 
our consumer division sells our products through a variety of distribution channels  including vars  mail order  distributors  and mass market retailers 
our oem division markets our products to oems  leveraging our custom design capabilities to offer custom memory solutions to address their specific needs 
we are focusing on several revenue growth initiatives  including developing and qualifying customized oem flash based products  including our zeus product line  for industrial applications  targeting new customers for our value add oem dram memory solutions  increasing retail sales of our storage product line  and expanding our international oem business in asia and europe 
over the past several years we have expanded our custom design capabilities of flash products for oem applications and invested significantly in industrial grade controller technology 
oem flash product revenue increased from million in to million in  and increased from to million in we expect our continued investments in oem flash controller development to result in continued revenue growth from our oem flash product line in and beyond 
oem flash product gross margins are typically significantly higher than our consumer flash product gross margins and were our highest gross margin product line in we offer monolithic dram memory modules and dram memory modules based on our stacking technology 
prior to  a substantial portion of our oem dram business had been comprised of stacked dram memory modules 
as a result of the introduction of new dram technologies  we expect that a higher percentage of our oem dram business will be derived from monolithic dram memory modules 
during  we faced transitional challenges as some of our oem dram customers transitioned from modules based on pc to pc and from ddr i to ddr ii technologies 
our oem monolithic and stacked dram memory module revenue decreased from million in to million in we plan to introduce dram components utilizing our next generation postage stamp stacking technology  based on the latest generation bga components  in the first half of we expect our oem stacked dram memory module business to remain difficult to project for the next several quarters as our customers continue to qualify the latest generation modules 
in the past year  we have invested significantly in the design  development and launch of our simpleshare product line of network attached storage  or nas  external drives 
during  we initiated external drive launches into numerous major us retailers and external storage drive revenue increased from million in to million in  and increased from to million in we expect to continue to grow our external storage drive business in 
table of contents during  we opened a logistics and purchasing office in hong kong and a research and development office in taiwan 
as part of our continuing effort to expand our international oem business  we plan to open an oem sales office in japan in we do not expect continued pursuit of these growth initiatives to have a material impact on our quarterly general and administrative expenses in compared to our recent quarterly run rates 
however  if revenues increase due to the execution of these initiatives  we expect related increases in sales and marketing expenses 
during  we also expanded our oem flash business through our acquisition on july  of memtech ssd  corporation  a provider of ultra rugged and reliable solid state flash drives 
the acquisition highlighted our continuing commitment to the oem flash market and enabled us to create one of the most comprehensive offerings of solid state drives and other flash based solutions for industrial and military applications 
on december   our board of directors terminated our employee stock purchase plan  or espp  and approved the acceleration of the vesting of all then current unvested stock options awarded under our stock incentive plan  including options held by our consultants  employees  officers and directors 
as a result of this action  stock options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock became exercisable effective december   representing approximately of our total current outstanding stock options as of such date 
all other terms and conditions applicable to such stock options  including the exercise prices  remain unchanged 
the decision to terminate the espp and accelerate vesting of the stock options was made primarily to avoid recognizing the related compensation expense in our future consolidated financial statements with respect to the shares issued under the espp and the unvested stock options upon our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  on january  we had no unvested stock options at december  it is anticipated that the accelerated vesting of these stock options will eliminate potential pre tax compensation expense recognition in future periods beginning january  of approximately million  of which approximately million would have been incurred during the year ending december  based upon the december  closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market of per share  our historical employee turnover rates and estimate of future employee separation  this action resulted in a non cash stock compensation expense of  in the fourth quarter of as a result of our adoption of sfas r  we have begun to significantly reduce the use and quantity of stock options compared to the quantity of stock options we granted in recent years 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides our pro forma net income and earnings per share as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure the compensation expense for employee stock awards during the years ended december   and gross profit as a percentage of revenues for our oem division is typically higher than our consumer division 
we track revenues and gross margins for our consumer and oem divisions 
we do not track separately  and do not intend to track separately  operating expenses for our consumer and oem divisions 
historically  a limited number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our revenue 
our ten largest customers accounted for an aggregate of  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
smart modular  micron semiconductor and cdw accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues in smart modular  micron semiconductor and cdw accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenues in cdw accounted for an aggregate of of our total revenues in other than smart modular  mircon semiconductor and cdw  no other customer accounted for more than of our total revenues in  or the composition of our major customer base changes from quarter to quarter as the market demand for our products changes  and we expect this variability will continue in the future 
we expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a majority of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in purchases by any of our major customers  would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see risk factors sales to a limited number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues  and the loss of any key customer would materially reduce our revenues 
international sales of our products accounted for  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
in  europe accounted for  of our total revenues 
no other foreign geographic area or single foreign country accounted for more than of our total revenues in  and for  and  more than of our international sales were denominated in us dollars 
in addition  our purchases of dram and flash components are currently denominated in us dollars 
however  we do face risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
see risk factors we face risks associated with doing business in foreign countries  including foreign currency fluctuations and trade barriers  that could lead to a decrease in demand for our products or an increase in the cost of the components used in our products 

table of contents in the past  we have been  and expect to continue to be  impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns resulting in lower sales in the first and second quarters of each year 
other factors  including component price fluctuations  may distort the effect of seasonality 
our ability to adjust our short term operating expenses in response to fluctuations in revenues is limited 
as a result  should revenues decrease to a level lower than expected in any given period  our results of operations would be harmed 
discontinued operations of xiran division in june  we discontinued the operation of our xiran division  which was formed in as a result of our acquisition of the assets of irvine networks  llc 
the xiran division developed advanced board level solutions that optimized server performance for networked storage applications  including ip storage

we believe that our existing assets  cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  together with cash that we expect to generate from our operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need or elect to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced

although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next twelve months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including our relationships with suppliers and customers  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  expansion of our international business  including the opening of offices and facilities in foreign countries  price discounts on our products to our customers  our pursuit of strategic transactions  including acquisitions  joint ventures and capital investments  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  our entrance into new markets

this revision is to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that these items be recognized as a current period charge regardless of whether they meet the criterion specified in arb in addition  sfas requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision to sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render service 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab which expresses the views of the sec regarding the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides the sec s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies

this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas is effective during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb no 
and fas no 

sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
sfas also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retrospectively 
therefore  the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by sfas sfas is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
reserves for inventory excess  obsolescence and lower of market values over costs 
we purchase raw materials in quantities that we anticipate will be fully used in the near term 
changes in operating strategy  customer demand and unpredictable fluctuations in market values of raw materials can limit our ability to effectively utilize all of the raw materials purchased and result in finished goods with above market carrying costs which may cause losses on sales to customers 
we regularly monitor potential excess  or obsolete  inventory by analyzing the length of time in stock and compare market values to cost 
when necessary  we reduce the carrying amount of our inventory to its market value 
allowances for doubtful accounts and price protection 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly and all past due balances over days are reviewed for collectibility 
additionally  we maintain allowances for limited price protection rights for inventories of our products held by our customers as a result of recent sales transactions to them 
if we reduce the list price of our products  these customers may receive a credit from us 
by monitoring our inventory levels with our customers  we estimate the impact of such pricing changes on a regular basis and adjust our allowances accordingly 

table of contents product returns 
we offer a majority of our customers that purchase products through our consumer channels limited rights to return unsold inventory 
in addition  while we may not be contractually obligated to accept returned products  we may determine that it is in our best interest to accept returns in order to maintain good relationships with our customers 
we provide for estimated future returns of inventory at the time of sale based on historical experience  and actual results have been within our expectations 
sales and marketing incentives 
sales and marketing incentives are offset against revenues or charged to operations in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
sales and marketing incentives amounted to million for  million for and million for  of which million  million and million  respectively  were offset against revenues  and  million and million  respectively  were charged as an operating expense 
consideration generally given by us to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of selling price  and therefore  a reduction of revenue 
however  if we receive an identifiable benefit in return for the consideration given to our customer that is sufficiently separable from our sales to that customer  such that we could have paid an independent company to receive that benefit  and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of that benefit  then the consideration is characterized as an expense 
we estimate the fair value of the benefits we receive by tracking the advertising done by our customers on our behalf and calculating the value of that advertising using a comparable rate for similar publications 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process incorporates an assessment of the current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
such differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
increases in valuation allowances result in the recording of additional tax expense 
further  if our ultimate tax liability differs from the periodic tax provision reflected in the consolidated statements of operations  additional tax expense may be recorded 
litigation and other contingencies 
management regularly evaluates our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  our management will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to our contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
valuation of long lived assets 
we assess the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
changes in our operating strategy can significantly reduce the estimated useful life of such assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material 
currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million invested in money market and other interest bearing accounts 
at december   we had no investments in marketable securities 
if interest rates were to decrease  the result would be an annual decrease in our interest income related to our cash and cash equivalents of approximately  however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such action 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents as of december  were as follows expected maturity date thereafter total fair value investments cash and cash equivalents money market funds weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk more than of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
consequently  if the value of the us dollar increases relative to a particular foreign currency  our products could become relatively more expensive 
in addition  we purchase substantially all of our ic components from local distributors of japanese  korean and taiwanese suppliers 
fluctuations in the currencies of japan  korea or taiwan could have an adverse impact on the cost of our raw materials 
to date  we have not entered any derivative instruments to manage risks related to interest rate or foreign currency exchange rates
