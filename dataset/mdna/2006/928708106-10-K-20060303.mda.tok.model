item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  develop  and market proprietary  high performance analog and mixed signal power management semiconductors 
we sell integrated voltage regulator semiconductors and scalable voltage regulator semiconductor chipsets in the computing  storage  networking  and consumer markets 
in  most of our revenue was derived from sales into the computing  storage  and networking markets 
we commenced operations in from to  we were primarily involved in developing our technology  recruiting personnel  and raising capital 
we made our first commercial shipments of products in 
table of contents and began to recognize revenue in the first quarter of our annual net revenue was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in  we generated net income of million  compared to million in in reviewing our performance  we focus on the following key non financial factors customers and market penetration  product introductions and performance 
we evaluate our performance as to these non financial factors against our operating plans and internally developed goals 
we also focus on and base management compensation in part on the following key financial factors net revenue  and as a percentage of net revenue  gross margin  and income from operations excluding stock based compensation 
we believe that evaluating our ongoing operating results and in particular  making comparisons to similar companies  may be difficult to understand if limited to reviewing only gaap financial measures 
in addition  because discounting future cash flows is a widely accepted method to value assets  and because the amounts of stock based compensation expense represent permanent differences between income and cash flow  it can be useful to consider income from operations without the distorting effect of this permanent non cash item 
the following table summarizes those key financial factors as well as income from operations and stock based compensation as a percentage of net revenue for the purpose of reconciling from income from operations to income from operations excluding stock based compensation as a percentage of net revenue over the last five quarters three months ended dec

 net revenue in thousands as a percent of net revenue gross margin income from operations stock based compensation expense income from operations  excluding stock based compensation our sales and accounts receivable are concentrated with a small group of customers 
in  ibm  internix  lite on technologies  metatech  and sabre each accounted for more than of our net revenue  and collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
if we were to lose or experience a significant reduction in sales to one or more of our key customers or if we were to fail to timely collect our accounts receivable from one or more of our key customers  our operating results and financial position could be materially adversely impacted 
an increasing percentage of our net revenue comes from orders received and shipped within the same quarter  or our turns business  which is inherently difficult to forecast 
we estimate turns business as a percent of net revenue as the ratio of net revenue less beginning backlog to net revenue making adjustment for the effect of sales return reserves or other adjustments to net revenue not included in backlog 
turns business was between and of net revenue in the fourth quarter of  compared to turns business between and of net revenue in third quarter of and between and of net revenue in the fourth quarter of as our turns business increases  forecasting revenue becomes more difficult 
as demand for our products is influenced by demand for our customers products  our revenue will depend on the timing  size  and speed of commercial introductions of systems that use our products  which is inherently difficult to forecast  as well as the ongoing demand for previously introduced systems 
in addition  demand for our products is influenced by our customers management of their own inventory 
our sales to distributors and outsourced suppliers such as original design manufacturers  or odms  contract equipment manufacturers  or cems  and merchant power supply manufacturers  are subject to higher risk and may be more volatile because they service demand from other companies which is more difficult to forecast accurately 
the sales of our products are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
generally  these orders allow  and customers routinely do  revise and cancel orders and reschedule delivery dates on relatively short notice pursuant to changes in the customer s requirements 
in addition  in 
table of contents circumstances where we have achieved our objectives in a period or when we have limited or insufficient inventory available  we may delay shipment of orders 
for these reasons  backlog has limited value as a predictor of future revenues 
while our limited operating history and recent growth make it difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business  we expect our business to be subject to varying order patterns 
we tend to experience a seasonally strong fourth quarter due to year end purchasing of electronic equipment 
in addition  over time we expect more of revenue to come from consumer and higher volume applications 
in these applications  we expect a disproportionate amount of our net revenue to be generated during the second half of the year as a result of the december holiday season 
we tend to experience a seasonally weak first quarter due to the lunar new year holiday in asia  during which time many of our customers  manufacturers  and subcontractors cease or significantly reduce their operations 
we typically sell directly through our internal sales force to customers in north america  and both directly and indirectly through distributors in other locations 
during the fourth quarter of  sales to international distributors represented of net revenue  compared to in the third quarter of and in the fourth quarter of we expect to change the sales channels we use and the mix of business between distribution and direct sales to fluctuate over time as our product offerings and customers evolve 
our sales through distributors typically result in lower gross margins  but also result in lower selling and collections expenses than are associated with direct sales 
our gross margins have historically varied significantly  and are expected to continue to vary  based on a variety of factors  including changes in the relative mix of the products we sell  the markets and geographies in which we sell  the size and nature of our customers in these markets  new product ramps  manufacturing volumes and yields  and inventory and overhead costs 
in particular  our recent reduction in inventory levels caused higher overhead costs in the fourth quarter and will continue to influence gross margins in the first quarter of also  over the course of we expect to be ramping many new products to production in new manufacturing and assembly processes subjecting us to higher manufacturing risk which could materially adversely impact gross margins 
in addition  consistent with the overall market for power management solutions  we expect to face price pressure over time 
in order to maintain or improve our gross margins  we need to introduce new  lower cost products  increase volumes  reduce unit costs or achieve a combination of these objectives 
we purchase our inventory pursuant to standard purchase orders 
as lead times at our manufacturing vendors can be up to three months or more  we typically build inventory based on our sales forecasts rather than customers orders  subjecting us to inventory risk and  in the event of an inventory write down  impacting our gross margins 
while in any period there may be fluctuations in our operating results  we expect total operating expenses generally to grow in absolute dollars but decline as a percentage of net revenue 
our research and development expenses can fluctuate as a result of long design cycles with periods of relatively low expenses punctuated with increased expenditures for prototypes and product development toward the end of the design cycle 
our selling  general  and administrative expenses are expected to grow in absolute dollars and may grow as a percentage of revenue as we invest in additional sales resources and continue to absorb the administrative cost of being a publicly traded company 
our effective tax rate has fluctuated based on our changing assessment of the mix of income and losses between domestic and international operations 
we expect that both this mix as well as the statutory rates we are subject to internationally may change over time  resulting in changes in our effective tax rate and reported income tax expense 
our deferred tax assets are nearly fully offset by a valuation allowance because  based on the available objective evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realizable 
if and as we continue profitable operations  we may revise this assessment  which could result in a favorable adjustment to reported income tax expense in the period of re assessment followed by higher reported tax rates in subsequent periods 
net revenue 
net revenue consists primarily of sales of our power management semiconductor products 
we have made no sales to us distributors 
our sales to international distributors are made under agreements that do not 
table of contents provide for price adjustments after purchase and provide limited return rights in the event of product failure 
we recognize revenue on our sales upon shipment with a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of purchases of silicon wafers and related costs of assembly  test and shipment of our products  and compensation and related costs of personnel and equipment associated with production management and quality assurance 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for employees involved in the design and development of our products  prototyping and other development expense  and the depreciation costs related to equipment being used for research and development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for employees involved in general management  sales and marketing  finance  and information technology  as well as travel and entertainment expenses  professional services expenses  and insurance expenses 
stock based compensation 
in connection with grants of stock options we recorded and million of deferred stock based compensation in and  respectively 
stock based compensation expenses consist primarily of amortization of deferred stock based compensation over the vesting period of the grant with adjustment made for grants that are forfeited 
we report stock based compensation separately  rather than including it in each expense classification  as we believe this allows for more meaningful comparison of operating expenses between periods and more consistent comparison of our financial results with other companies 
in addition  when we adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  our method for accounting for stock based compensation will change and the amounts recorded will change materially 
see recently issued accounting pronouncements for information on sfas no

income taxes 
our effective tax rate is based on our annual effective tax rate in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our annual effective tax rate is based on the mix of income between domestic and international operations  as well as the utilization of available net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable income in the us critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns and allowances  inventory valuation  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the estimates under different conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criterion is based on a purchase order received from the customer 
determination of criterion is based on shipment when title transfers to the customer 
determinations of criteria and are based on the fixed price charged for products delivered adjusted for any applicable discounts and management s judgment regarding the collectibility of the amounts billed 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 

table of contents revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment when title passes and a provision is made for estimated returns and allowances 
we have made no sales to us distributors 
us distributors typically receive sales price rebates and have inventory return privileges 
our sales to international distributors are made under agreements that do not provide for price adjustments after purchase and provide for limited return rights in the event of a product failure 
revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes 
we track historical rates of return by identifying the period in which the returned products were originally shipped 
we then compute a historical sales return rate for prior quarterly periods 
to determine the estimated return rate for any period  this historical sales return rate is adjusted for unusual past returns experience related to specific quality issues or other unusual circumstances that are not expected to recur and consideration of any current information about known product failure rates or business developments 
based on this historical data as well as current business expectations  we estimate sales returns 
as we have developed more historical experience and observed a decreasing trend in sales returns  we have reduced the levels the allowance for sales returns in while we believe our methodology enables us to make reasonable estimates of sales returns  because of the inherent nature of estimates and our limited historical experience  there is a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
a significant difference between actual amounts and our estimates could significantly impact our reported operating results 
inventory valuation 
inventory is valued at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis or market 
we record provisions for inventories for excess or obsolete work in process and finished goods 
newly developed products are generally not valued until they have been qualified for manufacturing and success in the marketplace has been demonstrated through sales and backlog  among other factors 
in addition to provisions based on newly introduced parts  statistical and judgmental assessments are made for the remaining inventory based on assumptions about future demand 
we identify excess and obsolete inventory by analyzing inventory aging  recent sales  order backlog  and demand forecasts 
based on these and other factors  we estimate on an individual product basis the net realizable value of our inventory 
net realizable value is determined as the forecast sales of the product less the estimated cost of disposal 
we reduce the carrying value to estimated net realizable value if it is less than standard cost 
once a provision is recorded to reduce inventories to their net realizable value  it is not reversed until the related inventory is disposed of or sold 
while our estimates require us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future events  we believe our relationships with our customers  combined with our understanding of the markets we serve  provide us with the ability to make reliable estimates 
if actual market conditions and resulting product sales were to be less favorable than our projections  additional inventory provisions may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains  and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax strategies and to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets for all periods since inception 
if we continue to record profitable operations  a reduction to our recorded valuation allowance may occur in future periods  which would likely result in an income tax benefit in the period of reduction and increase to our effective tax rate in subsequent periods

cost of revenue and gross margin 
cost of revenue was million in and million in cost of revenue increased primarily due to the increased volume of shipments 
gross margin was million in and million in  an increase of 
gross margin as a percent of net revenue was in  even with research and development 
research and development expenses were million in and million in  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to prototype and product development expenses  which increased by million and wage and related expenditures  which increased by million 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in and million in  an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to professional services expenses  which increased by million and finance expenses which increased by million 
these expenditures were related to the higher costs of being a public company including the cost of director s and officer s insurance and sarbanes oxley and securities law compliance generally 
in addition  wage and related expenditures increased million 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense was million in and million in the stock based compensation expense was primarily due to compensatory option grants prior to our initial public offering 
the decrease was primarily due to the company s accelerated amortization of deferred stock based compensation charges from under the graded vesting method resulting in a smaller charge in subsequent years 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in and million in income tax expense in is based on our effective tax rate of  an increase from in the increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to increases in foreign tax obligations 
our effective tax rate in and was significantly less than statutory rates because we utilized net operating loss carry forwards  from which no previous benefit had been recognized to offset taxable income in the us

volume of shipments increased in as compared to  primarily due to higher sales in the computing and storage markets 
in  we had no revenue from weikeng  an international distributor  compared to of net revenue in our operations were not impacted as the affected customers either established direct relationships with us or began purchasing from our other distributors 
as a result  our sales to one of these distributors increased such that it represented more than of our net revenue in cost of revenue and gross margin 
cost of revenue was million in and million in cost of revenue increased primarily due to the increased volume of shipments  partially offset by declining costs per unit 
gross margin was million in and million in  an increase of 
gross margin as a percent of net revenue increased to in as compared to in the increase in gross margin as a percent of net revenue was due primarily to changing sales mix resulting from a lower proportion of our first generation products  which had lower gross margins than our newer products 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million in and million in  an increase of 
the increase was largely associated with increased prototype expense  which increased by million 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in and million in  an increase of 
the increase was due primarily to increased wages and contractor fees of million and additional costs associated with being a publicly traded company including directors and officers insurance  which increased by million and professional services  which increased by million 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense was million in and in the increase was primarily due to options granted that were considered compensatory because the fair market value of our stock determined for financial reporting purposes was greater than the fair value determined by the board of directors on the date of grant of the options 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in and in income tax expense in is based on our effective tax rate of  an increase from in the increase in our effective tax rate was due to the commencement of profitable operations 
we recorded no income tax expense or benefit in because of pre tax losses and a full valuation allowance recorded against net operating losses 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  including cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments of million 
we generated million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in we currently have no debt and believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  and investments as well as cash flows from operations will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and meet our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
our operating activities provided net cash of million in  compared to million in and net cash used by operations of million in the primary sources of cash from operations in were net income providing million after adjusting for non cash items included in net income and increases in accounts payable of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable of million 
at the end of accounts receivable balances were unusually low due to the timing of shipments in the fourth quarter of and the increase in reflects a return to more normal levels relative to our sales 
the primary sources of cash from operations in were million in net income after adjusting for non cash items and increases in accrued liabilities of million  offset by increases in inventory of million 
the increase in inventory was related to our increasing levels of sales in the primary uses of cash in were net losses of million after adjusting for non cash items  partially offset by decreases in inventory of million 

table of contents our investing activities provided net cash of million in  compared to net cash used by investing of million and million in and  respectively 
the primary source of cash from investing in was the net maturity of short term investments of million offset by purchases of equipment  principally related to our upgrade of information systems  of million dollars 
in  we purchased million of short term investments using the proceeds of our initial public offering 
other cash used in investing activities during these periods was primarily for the acquisition of property and equipment 
our financing activities provided net cash of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the primary sources of cash from financing in were sales of securities under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
in  we received net proceeds of million from our initial public offering 
in addition  proceeds of million were received from the issuance of common stock in connection with employee exercises of stock options  partially offset by net payments on our line of credit of million 
in  the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net borrowings of million under our line of credit and million from the issuance of preferred stock 
in  we used our bank line of credit to generate an additional million of debt financing that was repaid in full within the same period 
this line of credit expired on june  contractual obligations we depend entirely upon third party foundries to manufacture our silicon wafers 
due to lengthy foundry lead times  we must order these materials well in advance of required delivery dates  and we are obligated to pay for the materials in accordance with their payment terms  which typically require payment within three months of shipment 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  and the years in which such obligations are expected to be settled in thousands and thereafter total future minimum lease commitments inventory purchase commitments inventory purchase commitments are comprised of the estimated obligation for in process silicon wafers 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
note k to our consolidated financial statements reports the pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share amounts  for through  as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock based compensation 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated operating results 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb no 
 chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current 
table of contents period charges this statement requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we may maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including money market funds  government treasury and agency securities 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
as of december   all of our short term investments were government treasury and agency securities and our cash equivalents were held in checking accounts and money market accounts 
our sales outside the united states are transacted in us dollars  accordingly our sales are not generally impacted by foreign currency rate changes 
to date  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material impact on our results of operations
