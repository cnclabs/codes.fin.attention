item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary note regarding forward looking statements to the extent that the information presented in this annual report on form k discusses financial projections  information or expectations about our business plans  results of operations  products or markets  or otherwise makes statements about future events  such statements are forward looking 
such forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as intends  anticipates  believes  estimates  projects  forecasts  expects  plans and proposes 
we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements and other forward looking statements made elsewhere in this annual report on form k as a result of specified factors  including those set forth in item a risk factors 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview revenues and profits for the fiscal year ended june  were significantly impacted by three major themes 
first  we experienced funding delays which resulted in decreased revenues for certain programs 
second  we made internal investments in product development and marketing and experienced delays in bringing certain products to market compared to original plans 
we anticipate that some of these projects will develop into fully marketable products in the near term and will begin generating revenues 
we may decide to make further investments into other product development based opportunities 
one such area of focus will likely be efforts to fully integrate the capabilities of our broadcast digital audio video  video surveillance  taps and e learning with our vigilys tm solution offering 
third  we recorded asset impairment charges of approximately million and inventory write downs of approximately million 
our business areas that encompass engineering and program management services have been in a continuous slow decline for the past five years while during this same period our cisr business has steadily grown 
we anticipate that this trend will continue as the dod continues to implement their information transformation strategy focusing on enhanced information technology and communications systems  data acquisition and real time situational awareness on such programs as composable forcenet and battle force composite network and integrated autonomous network management 
despite the trend of lower revenues related to our engineering and program management services  we believe there are potential growth opportunities that still exist in the following areas i increasing usage of technology to reduce ongoing support costs  ii adoption by the government of process improvement to achieve cost reductions  iii winning additional business by charging lower prices per hour  and iv capturing a greater market share in our current customer base by providing a wider range of services and products 
however  some of these approaches may result in lower margins for sys in the future 
our cost of revenues are affected by the mix of contract types cost reimbursement  fixed price or time and materials as well as the mix of prime contracts versus subcontracts and are additionally affected by the mix of product sales revenue verses services revenue 
significant portions of our contracts are time and materials and cost reimbursement contracts 
we are reimbursed for labor hours at negotiated hourly billing rates and other direct expenses under time and materials contracts and reimbursed for all actual costs  plus a fee  or profit  under cost reimbursement contracts 
the financial risks under these contracts are generally lower than those associated with other types of contracts  and margins are also typically lower than those on fixed price contracts 
the us government also has awarded us fixed price contracts 
such contracts carry higher financial risks because we must deliver the products  systems or contract services at a cost below the fixed contract value in order to earn a profit 
the following table shows our revenues from each of these types of contracts as a percentage of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended june   and cost reimbursement time and materials fixed price total the following table sets forth certain items  including consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ending june   and statement of operations data dollars percentage of revenue revenues cost of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses research  engineering and development expenses impairment charges income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax benefit provision net income loss revenues by reportable segment for years ending june   and were as follows dsg pssig total results of operations fiscal year vs 
fiscal year revenues 
revenues increased by approximately million or to million during fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of antin  webtech  logic  cvideo and rbis  which collectively accounted for million of the revenue increase during the year 
additional increases of approximately million were derived from support of cisr initiatives such as the forcenet assessments and decision support systems and integrated autonomous network management 
these total increases of approximately million were offset by a net million reduction in revenues related to our engineering and program management services  all of which were due to planned decreases in activities by those customers and are consistent with management s expectations of the general trends in our business 
as previously discussed  revenues related to programs previously captured in the dsg  where the activities were focused on public safety and security  have been included in the pssig to reflect the nature of the business being performed 
the growth in the pssig operating segment is primarily attributable to growth from the recent acquisitions of logic and cvideo which together added revenues of approximately million in fiscal and growth in the following programs i office of disaster preparedness odp interoperable communications technology assistance itp focused on interoperable communications for public safety  ii the joint warning and reporting network jwarn  a program that provides the military services near real time operational capabilities to collect  analyze and report nuclear  biological and chemical agent detections  identification  location and warning information  iii composable forcenet used in various homeland security related scenarios including hurricane katrina relief efforts and other first responder situations 
all of these programs have experienced growth in revenues over the prior year 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues include all direct costs such as labor  materials and subcontractor costs 
costs of revenues also include indirect overhead costs such as facilities  indirect labor  fringe benefits and other discretionary costs which are pooled and allocated to contracts on a pro rata basis 
generally  changes in direct costs are correlated to changes in revenue as resources are consumed in the production of that revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenues were and for fiscal and  respectively  resulting in gross margins of and for fiscal and  respectively 
gross margins are affected by the mix of contract types as well as the mix of contracts in which we act as a prime contractor versus a subcontractor and are additionally affected by the mix of product sales revenue verses services revenue 
during fiscal  the percentage of cost plus fee type contracts  which usually carry lower risk and lower margins  increased  offset by i the percentage of contracts in which we act as a prime contractor  which generally earn higher margins  which increased during fiscal and ii increased product sales in fiscal  which also generally earn higher gross margins than services revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include labor  fringe benefits  sales and marketing  bid and proposal b p and other indirect costs 
during fiscal  sg a increased by approximately million or over the prior year 
these increases were attributable to the following i increased spending for our infrastructure support consisting principally of labor and fringe expenses of approximately  to accommodate the increased scope of business operations from recent growth and acquisitions  ii increased spending for sales and marketing efforts consisting principally of labor and fringe expenses of approximately  iii increased amortization expense attributable to acquisitions of approximately  and iv increased audit  legal and other professional related expenses of approximately  we anticipate that we will likely maintain this level of sg a expenditures as we expand our sales and marketing efforts  develop new business lines and pursue acquisitions 
research  engineering and development expenses 
research  engineering and development r d expenses include burdened labor and material costs to develop new products as well as maintaining and enhancing our existing product capabilities 
r d expenses for fiscal year were approximately million as compared to approximately million in the prior year 
the increase in these expenses was partially attributable to a strategic decision at the beginning of the fiscal year regarding development and enhancing existing technology and also r d expenses incurred as a result of the acquisition of logic and cvideo 
we anticipate that we will maintain this level of r d for future periods as we continue to develop new products 
impairment charges 
during the fourth quarter management made a decision to suspend efforts to sell or further develop technology associated with sensorworx products  which are included in the operations of the pssig segment 
as a result  we assessed the impact of this decision on our ability to recover the carrying value of our long lived assets in this segment and also considered the impact during our annual impairment analysis of goodwill 
as a result of this assessment  we identified an impairment in the pssig segment of approximating million of which  million was a reduction of identified intangible assets  million was a reduction to goodwill and million was related to the write down of certain fixed assets 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down the carrying value of the forceviz software purchased in september based on an evaluation which indicated that future cash flows would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset 
the total amount recorded for impairment during the fourth quarter was approximately million 
in conjunction with management s decision to suspend efforts to sell products related to sensorworx  we considered the recoverability of other assets related to the pssig segment and determined that an adjustment was necessary to reduce the carrying value of related inventory to the lower of cost or market  which resulted in a charge to cost of sales approximating million 
income loss from operations 
the company incurred a loss from operations of million as compared to income from operations of million in the prior year 
this decrease in income from operations is primarily due to the million impairment charge  discussed above  as well as increases in sg a expenses  and r d expenses noted above 
income loss from operations for the current fiscal year includes total share based compensation expense of approximately  which included non cash expenses associated with stock options granted to employees and the employee stock purchase plan and additional shares issued to former antin shareholders 
the  was classified in the accompanying statement of operations in the category of cost applicable to the employee labor cost 
the recognition of these share based compensation expenses is in accordance with sfas no 
r  which was adopted as of the beginning of the current fiscal year 
other income expense 
other income expense decreased  or  to  the decrease is due to a net increase in interest expense related to the issuance of approximately million in convertible notes in february  partially offset by the conversion of convertible notes during the fiscal year 
the increase in interest expense was offset by increased interest income earned on the cash proceeds from the convertible notes and equity securities issued in february while the cash proceeds remained in interest bearing accounts prior to distribution 
income tax benefit provision 
the income tax benefit provision for fiscal was  versus  in fiscal the primary difference in our effective tax rate for fiscal versus fiscal relates to nondeductible share based compensation expense as a result of adopting sfas no 
r at the beginning of fiscal fiscal year vs 
fiscal year revenues 
for the fiscal year ended june   our revenues increased to million from million for the same period in the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of polexis and antin which together provided million of the million in net revenue growth 
the remaining net increase was derived from increases in support of cisr initiatives such as the composable forcenet and battle force composite network which grew by million or over the prior year 
these increases were offset by a net million reduction in revenues related to our engineering and program management services  primarily in the nmci  unrep and mss programs  all of which were due to planned decreases in activities by those customers 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues include all direct costs such as labor  materials and subcontractor costs 
cost of revenues also include indirect overhead costs such as facilities  indirect labor  fringe benefits and other discretionary costs which are pooled and allocated to contracts on a pro rata basis 
generally  changes in direct costs are correlated to changes in revenue as resources are consumed in the production of that revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue was for as compared to for the same period in resulting in gross margins of and respectively 
the increase in margins is due to a slightly higher composition of direct labor costs in which carries a higher margin than other contract costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include labor  fringe benefits  sales and marketing  bid and proposal b p and other indirect costs 
although the actual dollar amounts of sg a have increased by approximately million from million to million  g a has decreased as a percentage of revenues due to the growth in revenues 
the spending increase is due to investments made to expand our infrastructure to accommodate the increased scope of business operations from recent growth and acquisitions 
research  engineering and development expenses 
research  engineering and development r d expenses include burdened labor and material costs to develop new products as well as maintaining and enhancing our existing product capabilities 
r d expenses for fiscal year were million 
we did not incur any material r d expenses in fiscal the increase in r d expenses in fiscal was primarily the result of the acquisition of xsilogy in fiscal income from operations 
income from operations as a percentage of revenues increased from in the prior year to in the current year 
this increase is primarily due to the revenue growth which results in the reduction of sg a costs as a percentage of revenues 
other income expense 
other expense increased  or to  the increase in other expense primarily related to increased interest expense  which increased to  in from  in this increase is primarily attributable to increased interest expense from the convertible notes issued by the company in fiscal through a private placement and in connection with the polexis acquisition 
the increase is further attributable to the accretion of a debt discount related to the private placement 
income tax provision 
the income tax provision increased to  in from  in the effective tax rate was for versus in the same period in the prior year s tax rate was higher due to a change in estimate for tax refunds receivables and prepaid taxes 
dividends 
there were no dividends authorized or paid in for  there was  in dividends paid on our preference stock 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements through cash flows provided from operations  long term borrowings including the sale of convertible notes  sales of equity securities and more recently through use of our line of credit 
the significant components of our working capital are liquid assets such as cash  trade accounts receivable  inventories and income tax receivable  reduced by accounts payable  accrued expenses  line of credit  the current portion of our term note  the current portion of our convertible notes payable  the current portion of our deferred tax liabilities and deferred revenue 
working capital was million at june  compared to million at june  the significant changes to working capital during were as follows we funded our acquisitions primarily from debt equity financing and partially from working capital 
the opening balance sheets of the acquired businesses increased current assets by million primarily consisting of million of accounts receivable and million of inventory  excluding the use of cash for the acquisition  and increased current liabilities by million primarily consisting of million of accrued payroll 
the million of cash used for the acquisitions was partially offset by million from the line of credit used for the acquisition and the use of proceeds from the private placement in february million of the proceeds from the line of credit that was used for the acquisition of rbis was subsequently converted to an installment note payable over four years 
although the million of the current portion of convertible debt at june  was converted into common stock during  an additional million of convertible notes became current during the year 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million during fiscal to million  as of june  the decrease was primarily due to the following million in payments for acquisitions  million in expenditures for property and equipment 
offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes  million in proceeds from common stock issuance in a private placement  million in proceeds from borrowings under our line of credit  million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants  and million in proceeds from issuing stock under the employee stock purchase plan 
as of june   sys had convertible notes payable totaling million consisting of million remaining from a million private placement completed during excluding  balance of note discount   issued in connection with the acquisition of polexis   issued in connection with the antin acquisition  and million issued in conjunction with the private placement in february other than the conversion rate on the notes payable issued in february  the conversion rates on the balance of the notes payable are all at prices less than the market price as of june  if the convertible notes are not converted into shares of sys common stock  we will be required to repay in cash million of the convertible notes that mature in fiscal and million that mature in fiscal on february   sys completed a private placement of  in a subscription offering of units consisting of common stock and unsecured subordinated convertible notes 
each unit consisted of  restricted shares of sys common stock at per share and a three year  unsecured subordinated convertible note payable bearing interest at per annum  payable quarterly 
the note holder has the option to convert all but not part of the note at any time prior to maturity into shares of sys common stock at per share  or keep the note until maturity 
sys has a conversion option commencing one year from the date of issuance whereby if our stock trades at per share for at least five consecutive trading days  sys can force the conversion of the notes then outstanding 
sys issued  shares of common stock pursuant to this offering 
an additional  shares could be issued if all of the notes are converted into common stock 
one of our regular sources of liquidity is our revolving line of credit facility for million that expires on december  our revolving line of credit facility had an outstanding balance of million at june  the million revolving line of credit facility allows sys to use i the full million for working capital purposes or ii under a sub facility  up to million of the credit facility for permitted acquisition purposes and  for minority investment purposes 
the line of credit is subject to certain restrictions on permitted acquisitions and minority investments  and in some cases  we must receive the lender s consent prior to using the facility for such purposes 
if used for permitted acquisitions or minority investments  these advances must be repaid over months 
during fiscal and in connection with the purchase of rbis  we utilized million of this line for payment of a portion of the purchase consideration 
in accordance with the terms of the revolving line of credit facility  the million was converted to a term note effective june  the term note is payable in monthly installments of  plus interest or  annually for the fiscal years through as a result of the borrowing for the rbis acquisition  the amount available under the line of credit was reduced to million and consequently  the remaining available borrowing capacity on the revolving line of credit facility was approximately million at june  we must maintain certain financial covenants  including tangible effective net worth  current assets to current liabilities  quarterly net income  ratio of senior debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and the ratio of cash flow to the current portion of long term debt 
as of june   we were in technical default of the financial covenants related to minimum quarterly net income  the ratio of cash flow to the current portion of long term debt  and the ratio of senior debt to ebitda 
the lender has granted a waiver of these covenants for the measurement period ended june  on september   sys and the lender agreed to amend the terms of the line of credit to eliminate the minimum quarterly net income covenant  current assets to current liabilities covenant and ratio of senior debt to ebitda covenant and modify the tangible effective net worth covenant and cash flow coverage ratio covenant 
we anticipate we will be in compliance with the modified covenants through the expiration date of the credit facility based on our operating budget for fiscal we intend to renew or replace the credit facility prior to the expiration date 
we have the option of being charged prime plus or libor plus basis points on the credit facility and prime plus or libor plus basis points on the sub facility subject to minimum advance amounts and duration under the libor option 
the loan is collateralized by all of our assets including accounts receivable 
borrowings are limited to of our billed accounts receivable that are less than days old 
management believes that sys will have sufficient cash flow from operations and funds available under the revolving credit agreement to finance its operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in order for the line of credit to be available for working capital purposes after december   an extension of the expiration date must be obtained 
management and the lender are currently in negotiations to renew the line of credit to extend the expiration date to december  although management believes it is probable that the line of credit will be renewed and extended  in the event the credit facility is terminated  we have sufficient cash on hand to repay the amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
the maturity dates of principal amounts owed under the million term note with this lender would not be affected by the termination of the line of credit 
however  in the event of termination  the covenants currently applicable to the line of credit would remain applicable to the term note for as long as amounts are outstanding 
long term liquidity and continued acquisition related growth will depend on our ability to manage cash  raise cash through debt and equity financing transactions and regain profitability 
we may seek to raise additional capital from time to time as market conditions permit and subject to board approval 
the loss for the current fiscal year may impact our ability to raise capital or extend the expiration date of our line of credit 
commitments amounts in s total thereafter convertible notes note payable operating leases total includes principal and interest off balance sheet arrangements sys does not have any off balance sheet arrangements  investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 
in addition  sys has not entered into any derivative contracts 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the majority of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the us government that are typically cost plus fee  time and material and fixed price contracts 
revenue on these contracts results from work performed on these contracts by the company s employees and subcontractors and from pass through of costs for materials 
revenue on cost plus fee and fixed price contracts is recorded as contract allowable costs are incurred and fees earned 
revenue for time and material contracts is recorded on the basis of contract allowable labor and subcontractor hours worked times the contract defined billing rates plus the cost of material used in the performance on the contract 
revenue from service type fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate output methods to measure service provided  and contract costs are expensed as incurred 
in general  sys does not recognize revenues in excess of the allowable funding limitations on any delivery order or contract until negotiations are finalized 
on occasion  our customers request that we proceed on a tasking in advance of the formal contract modification 
we evaluate these requests according to their characteristics and the circumstances in which they occur after taking all factors into consideration such as probability of cost recovery  our experience with the customer  and satisfactory evidence that supports the customer s intent to issue the modification 
in these circumstances  if revenue recognition criteria are met  we only record revenue equal to costs incurred until such time as contract modifications are finalized 
if our assessment for the probability of cost recovery changes in a subsequent period due to a change in circumstances then the revenues associated with those costs incurred may be reversed 
contract costs  including indirect costs  on certain us government contracts are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency the dcaa before final billing and collection of receivables 
revenues have been recorded at amounts expected to be realized upon final settlement 
anticipated contract losses are recognized in the period in which they are identified 
the company also recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware  hardware products which include software that is more than incidental  hardware and software maintenance agreements  and application service provider asp services 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment  or once all applicable criteria have been met in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no sab 
allowances are provided for estimated returns and discounts 
such allowances are adjusted periodically to reflect actual and anticipated experience 
revenue from maintenance and asp services are recognized ratably over the service term  which is typically one or two years 
the unrecognized revenue portion of maintenance agreements billed is recorded as deferred revenue 
certain agreements include multiple deliverables or elements for products  software and or services 
accordingly  the company separates its deliverables into units of accounting in accordance with the provisions of emerging task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables using the residual method 
in the absence of fair value for an undelivered element  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a deferral of revenue recognition for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are fulfilled 
revenue on software products and software related elements are recognized  in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition 
for arrangements that include both hardware products and software products  the company evaluates the arrangement based on eitf  applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software 
in accordance with the provisions of eitf  the arrangement is divided between software related elements and non software deliverables 
software related elements are accounted for in accordance with sop when software arrangements contain multiple elements and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  the company accounts for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop no 
otherwise  revenue is deferred and recognized in accordance with sop indirect expense rate variance 
sys applies overhead and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of direct contract costs based on annual budgeted indirect expense rates 
to the extent actual expenses for an interim period are greater than the budgeted rates  the variance is deferred if management believes it is probable that the variance will be absorbed by future contract activity 
this probability assessment includes projecting whether future indirect costs will be sufficiently less than the annual budgeted rates or can be absorbed by seeking increased billing rates applied on cost plus fee contracts 
at the end of each interim reporting period  management assesses the recoverability of any amount deferred to determine if any portion should be charged to expense 
in assessing the recoverability of variances deferred  management takes into consideration estimates of the amount of direct labor and other direct costs to be incurred in future interim periods  the feasibility of modifications for provisional billing rates  and the likelihood that an approved increase in provisional billing rates can be passed along to a customer 
variances are charged to expense in the periods in which it is determined that such amounts are not probable of recovery 
at the end of the fiscal year  indirect rates are applied using actual costs incurred 
accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable balances include unbilled receivables which are comprised of work in process which will be billed in accordance with contract terms and delivery schedules  as well as amounts billable upon final dcaa audit of our overhead rates  contract completion  milestones or completion of rate negotiations 
payments to us for performance on certain of our us government contracts are subject to audit by the dcaa  and are subject to government funding 
we provide an allowance against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from rate negotiations and audit adjustments 
to the extent that actual adjustments due to rate negotiations or audit adjustments differ from our estimates  our revenue may be impacted 
historically  sys has not required significant allowances for these risks 
since our primary customer is the us government  sys historically has not recorded significant charges for bad debt expense 
bad debt charges  if needed  are recognized in the period in which they are identified 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the asset and liability method which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be computed for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
valuation and impairment review of acquired intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we account for our purchases of acquired companies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas and account for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  we allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology  are amortized to expense over time  while in process research and development  if any  is recorded as an expense at the acquisition date 
the majority of the entities acquired by us do not have significant tangible assets and  as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
our intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using a method that best reflects how their economic benefits are utilized or  if a pattern of economic benefits cannot be reliably determined  on a straight line basis over their useful lives of one to fifteen years 
we evaluate all of our long lived assets primarily property and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in accordance with sfas  when a long lived asset or intangible asset is abandoned or is determined to be impaired  the carrying value or amount of impairment is charged to expense in the period of abandonment or the period the impairment is identified 
goodwill 
goodwill  which is equal to the excess of cost over the fair value of acquired net assets and identifiable intangible assets  has been recorded in conjunction with several of the company s business combinations  is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step consists of estimating the fair values of each of the reporting units based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value derived by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s assets and liabilities from its estimated fair value calculated in step one 
the impairment charge represents the excess of the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill over the implied fair value of their goodwill 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested annually at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
the company tests goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter and whenever indications of an impairment are identified 
software development costs 
capitalization of material software development costs begins when a product s technological feasibility has been established in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas 
to date  there has been only a short time period between achieving technological feasibility  which the company has defined as the establishment of a working model  which typically occurs when beta testing commences  and the general availability of such software 
consequently  the company has not capitalized any software development costs under the provisions of sfas no 
research and development 
the company expenses all applicable research and development costs as incurred 
share based compensation as of july  we account for our employee stock purchase plan espp  stock plans and other forms of share based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires the recognition of the fair value of share based compensation in net income 
the fair value of our share based compensation was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of share based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected to use the straight line method for awards granted after the adoption of sfas no 
r and continue to use a graded vesting method for awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for our share based compensation under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin no 
provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the accounting provisions of fin no 
will be effective for us beginning july  and we are in the process of determining the effect  if any  the adoption of fin no 
will have on our financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas proscribes a single definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the accounting provisions of sfas will be effective for us beginning july  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires companies to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
when the effect of initial adoption is material  companies will record the effect as a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings 
sab will be effective for us beginning july  we do not believe the initial adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment income and interest expense 
as of june  our cash was primarily invested in a money market interest bearing account 
a hypothetical adverse change in the average interest rate on our money market cash investments would have had no material effect on net income for the year ended june  we currently do not utilize any derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks 
we have interest rate risk in that borrowings under our line of credit and term note are based on variable market interest rates 
as of june   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding under our credit facility and million outstanding under a term note 
presently  the revolving credit line bears interest at a rate of prime plus and the term note bears interest at a rate of prime plus 
a hypothetical increase in the weighted average interest rate of per annum on our combined line of credit and term note would have decreased our operating cash flows for the year ended june  by approximately million 
our privately issued convertible notes have fixed interest rates of  but have exposure to changes in the debt s fair value 
we believe that the fair value of our total outstanding convertible notes is approximately million book value of
