item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general overview our products are sold primarily into the electronics assembly  semiconductor dram memory  and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets  where we sell products both to original equipment manufacturers of production equipment and to end user customers that produce circuit boards and semiconductor wafers and devices 
historically these markets have been very cyclical  with periods of rapid growth as worldwide capacity is added to support increased consumer demand for electronic products  and new capital equipment is purchased as a result of technology changes in electronics components  such as miniaturization  and changing production requirements 
these periods of growth have historically been followed by periods of excess capacity and reduced capital spending 
our operating results declined in in response to downturns in both the electronic assembly and semiconductor capital equipment markets that began late in the third quarter of and continued through the second quarter of although the economies in the countries where most of our products are sold continued to be strong  the semiconductor market weakened  and with it  the circuit board production market 
while this downturn was not as severe as the downturn experienced from to early  it resulted in a significant decline in operating results over our exceptionally strong results in consolidated revenues for declined from to million 
operating results for benefited from a lower cost structure implemented during  and in response to reduced revenues and operating losses  we took aggressive cost reduction actions  including reducing our worldwide employment by over from peaks  and closing or downsizing facilities 
as a result  operating profits were million despite lower revenues compared to order rates during the fourth quarter of improved significantly over the rates experienced in the first three quarters of  to levels not experienced since mid revenues in the fourth quarter of increased compared to the third quarter of and increased compared to the fourth quarter of order rates in the first month of were strong  and although we cannot predict with precision the trends in markets we serve  we expect continued strength in our markets  at least for the early months of as a result of our lower cost structure enabling us to generate profits during our recent cyclical downturns and the recent improvement in order rates during the fourth quarter  we reduced the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes that had been established in the third quarter of the reduction in the valuation allowance resulted in a non cash income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of million 
see note of this form k for a further discussion of the accounting treatment for income taxes 
our balance sheet is also well positioned as the result of improved operating results and effective management of working capital and other assets 
we have no debt and our cash and marketable securities are million at december  compared to million at december  during the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our business into two operating segments  the electronic assembly and semiconductor segments  in order to increase focus and management attention on growth opportunities in our markets the electronic assembly segment designs  manufactures and sells optical process control sensors and inspection systems for the electronics assembly equipment market 
the semiconductor segment designs  manufactures and sells optical and other process control sensors and related equipment for the semiconductor capital equipment market 

table of contents results of operations for the three years ended december  revenues our revenues decreased by to million in from million in  and increased in from million in the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  revenues by product line in thousands electronic assembly oem sensors    smt systems    total electronic assembly    semiconductor    total    electronic assembly revenues from our electronic assembly sensors decreased million or during compared to  and increased by million or during compared to during  revenue from electronic assembly sensors were negatively impacted by a downturn in our smt electronic assembly market  which began in the fourth quarter of  and continued through the second quarter of sensor revenues were sequentially higher in the third and fourth quarters of  but had not yet returned to the peak levels of in addition  sensor revenue was favorably impacted by the introduction of a new inprinter inspection camera for dek international gmbh 
during  sensor revenues were positively impacted by improved market conditions in the worldwide market for smt capital equipment and by the introduction of two new sensors for one of our large customers 
these sensors were designed for the latest generation pick and place machine of this customer  which was introduced during and resulted in a higher content of our products per machine than in the previous version 
during  revenues began to improve during the second half of the year due to improved market conditions and the initial introduction of the previously discussed new sensors 
prior to  revenues were negatively impacted by the depressed market conditions in the worldwide market for smt capital equipment 
this slowdown began in the first half of and continued throughout and early revenues from our smt systems products decreased million or during compared to and increased million or during compared to during  revenue from our smt system products were negatively impacted by a downturn in our smt electronic assembly market  which began in the fourth quarter of  and continued through the second quarter of partially offsetting the negative impact from the market downturn  was the introduction and positive market acceptance of our next generation solder paste inspection system  the se ultra  and increased sales of our flex series aoi systems  which increased approximately 
million compared to during and  revenues from smt systems  primarily our se solder paste inspection system  were positively impacted by improved market conditions in the smt capital equipment markets and by success in selling systems to many of the large manufacturers of circuit boards in asia particularly china 
a large portion of the worldwide production capacity for printed circuit boards is being added in asia  and we have been successful in selling inspection systems to new and existing customers in that region through our expanded distribution capability opened singapore sales office in and a sales office in china in 
in addition  revenues from our flex series aoi systems increased million compared to levels 
we believe that increased use of outsourcing for circuit board assembly  production difficulties associated with smaller component sizes  increased production speeds and increased cost pressure on companies manufacturing circuit boards has caused increased demand for our inspection equipment 
international revenue from electronic assembly sensors and smt systems totaled million in  million in and million in  comprising approximately of electronic assembly revenue in   and the international markets of china and the rest of asia  japan and europe account for a significant portion of the production capability of capital equipment for the manufacture of electronics  the primary market for our electronic assembly sensor and smt system product lines 
an increasing proportion of our sales have been to international customers as manufacturing of electronic components has migrated offshore  particularly to china 

table of contents semiconductor revenues from semiconductor products decreased million or in compared to  following an increase of million or in compared to the decrease in was primarily due to lower revenues from wafer mapping sensors as a result of depressed market conditions in the semiconductor fabrication capital equipment market for much of frame grabber revenues decreased slightly in compared to  as the result of depressed conditions in the general industrial capital equipment markets 
the increase in was primarily due to higher revenues from wafer mapping sensors as a result of improved market conditions in the semiconductor fabrication capital equipment market for much of frame grabber revenues increased slightly in compared to  as the result of improved conditions in the general industrial capital equipment markets 
our wafer mapping and frame grabber products are relatively mature 
we anticipate that future growth in our semiconductor revenues  exclusive of changes related to capital procurement cycles  will come from our new wafersense product line 
wafersense is a family of wireless  waferlike precision measurement tools for in situ setup  calibration and process optimization in semiconductor processing equipment 
we are currently working on several new additions to the wafersense product line 
international revenue from semiconductor products totaled million or of total semiconductor revenue in  million or of total semiconductor revenue in  and million or of total semiconductor revenue  in the level of international revenue as a percentage of total semiconductor revenue is due to fluctuations in the level of wafer mapper sales 
our wafer mapping sensors do not generate significant international revenue 
the increase in international revenue as a percentage of total semiconductor revenue for  compared to  is due to lower levels of wafer mapper sales 
the decrease in international revenue as a percentage of total semiconductor revenue for  compared to  is due to higher levels of wafer mapper sales 
gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of sales for both our electronic assembly and semiconductor products are somewhat dependent on the level of revenues and resulting production levels over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs that do not vary with activity levels 
in addition  with higher production volumes manufacturing processes become more efficient and we are able to negotiate lower material costs from our suppliers as the result of volume discounts which reduces the overall cost of producing products for sale 
the mix of products sold can also have an impact on electronic assembly and semiconductor margins 
electronic assembly gross margin as a percentage of electronic assembly sales were in  in and in the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in  compared to  was due in part  to pricing pressures from increased competition for sales of our solder paste inspection machines  reducing electronic assembly gross margins as a percentage of sales by approximately two percentage points 
the remaining decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in was due to product mix  with a higher percentage of our sensor and system sales coming from lower margin products  and the lower level of production volumes  which reduced manufacturing efficiency when compared to with respect to our systems products  and particularly our solder paste inspection machines  we anticipate that pricing pressures will continue in due to additional competition in the marketplace for solder paste inspection 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales in compared to resulted from increased production volume  a change in revenue mix with higher levels of higher margin oem sensor revenues  and the impact of cost reduction measures implemented during to revenue and production volumes were higher in compared to  resulting in improved manufacturing efficiency 
further  our oem sensor products carry higher gross margins as a percentage of revenue than end user systems products  and our sensor products constituted a growing proportion of our electronic assembly revenue in and semiconductor gross margin as a percentage of sales were in  in and in similar to the electronic assembly segment  gross margin as a percentage of sales for the semiconductor segment is dependent on revenue mix and the level of production volume over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
gross margins decreased as a percentage of revenue in from due to decreased volume  and a change in revenue mix  with lower sales of higher margin wafer mappers 
the increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue in  compared to  was due to increased volume  a change in our revenue mix  with higher levels of wafer mapper sales  and the impact of cost reduction measures implemented during to we currently expect gross margins to decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue in  from levels  due to anticipated changes in revenue mix  and new product introductions  which are expected to carry lower gross margins than our existing products 

table of contents operating expenses we believe continued investment in research and development of new products  coupled with continued investment and development of our sales channels  is critical to future growth and profitability 
we maintain research and development and sales and marketing expenses at relatively high levels  even during periods of downturn in our electronic assembly and semiconductor capital equipment markets  as we continue to fund development of important new products  and continue to invest in our sales channels and develop new sales territories 
we are currently expecting research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses to be higher in  compared to  as we continue new product development efforts  and continue development of our sales channels and new sales territories 
our research and development and other operating costs will increase for stock compensation expenses due to our required adoption of sfas no 
r share based payment 
in addition  we are currently considering additional research and development projects  and may elect to increase expenditures based on an assessment of the future revenue and profit potential of these projects 
further  we expect sales commissions and incentive compensation costs to be higher in compared to  due to anticipated improvements in revenue and profit levels 
fluctuations in the level of research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for both the electronic assembly and semiconductor segments are primarily due to fluctuations in the level of revenue in  and electronic assembly research and development expenses were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the decrease in research and development expenses in compared to  was principally due to a  decrease in company wide incentive compensation costs in  resulting from lower levels of revenue and profits 
likewise  a  increase in company wide incentive compensation contributed to the increase in research and development expenses in compared to during we completed development of our new se ultra solder paste inspection system  and our new inprinter inspection camera for dek international gmbh 
we also started development of an enhanced version of our flex series automated optical inspection system 
during and  research and development efforts were primarily focused on initial development activities for several new sensor products  including development activities for the new embedded process verification sensor family epv  continued development of the se and flex series inspection systems  next generation laseralign products  and board alignment cameras 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in  and million or of revenue in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to  was principally due to a million reduction in sales commissions and company wide incentive compensation costs associated with lower levels of revenue and profits in  partially offset by increased costs for our new sales office in china that opened in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to  is due to additional investment in sales and marketing  primarily in asia  increases in other costs associated with supporting a growing end user systems revenue base and a  increase in company wide incentive compensation costs associated with higher revenue and profit levels 
increased corporate governance costs  including costs associated with implementing an internal control framework in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of had a significant impact on increased selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to semiconductor research and development expenses were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in a  decrease in incentive compensation costs  resulting from lower levels of revenue and profit in  contributed to the decrease in research and development expenses in compared to likewise  a  increase in incentive compensation costs in contributed to the increase in research and development expenses in compared to during and  research and development efforts were primarily focused on enhancements to the semiconductor wafer mapping sensor family and development of new products for the semiconductor market  including development and enhancements to the wafersense auto leveling sensor als first introduced in late  with subsequent new product introductions in 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in expenses in were flat compared to  as a  reduction in costs for sales commissions and company wide incentive compensation programs resulting from lower revenue and profit levels in were offset by higher costs for additional management and marketing employees 
the increase in expenses compared to is due to a  increase in sales commissions and incentive compensation costs associated with higher revenue and profit levels in restructuring and severance costs during to  we implemented a series of workforce reductions  closed our facility in california  downsized facilities in the uk and minneapolis and made other reductions in discretionary spending designed to reduce our cost structure in light of declining revenues during those periods caused by the depressed capital equipment markets for suppliers to electronics manufacturing 
changes to the consolidated restructuring liability accounts were as follows in thousands employee termination benefits lease commitment costs other total restructuring liability  december  initial expense and accrual  cash payments  restructuring liability  december  change in estimate cash payments restructuring liability  december  cash payments restructuring liability  december  electronic assembly in september  we incurred approximately  of severance and costs associated with restructuring measures 
cost reduction measures included workforce reductions associated with downsizing direct sales and marketing resources in north america and europe  the consolidation of uk r d operations into our minneapolis headquarters and other general cost reduction measures 
severance costs were associated with a planned workforce reduction of people 
of these costs  approximately  was paid as of december  severance and associated costs of  were accrued as of december   and paid as of september  in december  we completed the buy out of our uk facility lease effective in the first quarter of following this buyout  we signed a new lease for less space in the same facility 
the cost of the buy out  paid in december  was approximately  in addition  during december  we permanently vacated approximately  square feet of our primary minneapolis facility and recorded a restructure charge of approximately  for future lease payments reduced for estimated sub lease income of approximately  and related costs 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of  these charges reflected our change in estimate relative to the amount of sub lease income we will receive from space vacated during the corporate restructuring in december based on our unsuccessful attempts to secure a sub lease tenant for this space  and given that our lease term ends in may  we determined it was appropriate to record an additional charge assuming that no sub lease income would be received on the property vacated during semiconductor in january  we incurred approximately  of severance costs and facility closure costs associated with further consolidation of our semiconductor product group from redwood city  california to portland  oregon 
severance costs were associated with a workforce reduction of people 
substantially all of these costs were paid as of march  
table of contents in september  we incurred approximately  of severance costs associated with the termination of one employee  which was paid as of december  gain on technology transfer and license in march  our electronic assembly segment transferred the rights and technology necessary to manufacture our digital range sensors drs to the optical gaging products ogp division of quality vision international  inc qvi 
in addition  we granted qvi a non exclusive license to the intellectual property associated with this product line and sold a portion of our inventory as part of this transaction 
qvi had been the primary customer for drs sensors prior to this agreement as part of a separate agreement 
the agreement called for qvi to pay  as a one time fee for the purchase of fixtures  a technology transfer fee and a non refundable royalty payment 
in addition  we sold qvi raw material inventories associated with the product line 
the gain was determined as the difference between the proceeds received and our carrying value of product line inventory and fixed assets prior to the sale 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded a  gain in the three month period ended march  amortization of intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our electronic assembly segment was approximately  in  and we expect amortization expense for acquired intangible assets related to our electronic assembly segment to be  in amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our semiconductor segment was  in   in and  in the decrease in semiconductor related amortization in was due to certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the decrease in semiconductor related amortization in  compared to  resulted from a  charge in the third quarter of to accelerate the amortization of certain acquired intangible assets that were determined to be non strategic 
these general purpose product lines from our acquisition of hama  inc in were discontinued during  and consequently  amortization of the developed technology was accelerated 
we expect amortization expense for acquired intangible assets related to our semiconductor segment to be  in income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  us tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principals 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our decision to record the valuation allowance was based on the cumulative losses we had incurred over the three years prior to that date  the fact that we were continuing to generate operating losses and that we fully utilized our loss carryback benefit in from the third quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of  we continued to provide a full valuation allowance against all future tax benefits produced by our operating results 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  initially established in the third quarter of  resulting in a non cash income tax benefit of million 
our tax benefit for  including reversal of the valuation allowance  was equal to million 
we considered a number of factors in our decision to reduce the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  including our anticipated level of profitability in the future  our history of recent profitability and cumulative profitability since inception  and utilization of our available us based net operating loss carryforwards 
after considering these factors  we concluded that a reduction in the valuation allowance was appropriate 
accordingly  the benefit we will derive in future accounting periods from carryforwards and deductible temporary differences has been reflected as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 
due to the reduction of the valuation allowance  we expect to be taxed at a more normalized rate  approximating an effective rate of  starting with the first quarter of during  we recorded an income tax provision of approximately million resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately 
income earned in resulted in full utilization of our remaining us federal tax operating loss carryforwards 
because we maintained a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in our cash taxes due and payable for the year were recorded as an expense  resulting in the effective rate of we recorded a tax provision of  in resulting from tax on income generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
there was no tax benefit recorded on us based operating losses in as the result of establishing a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in 
table of contents interest income and other interest income and other primarily includes interest earned on investments and losses associated with foreign currency translation 
interest income and other increased during as the result of additional invested funds  higher interest rates and lower translation losses 
interest income and other increased during as the result of additional invested funds  partially offset by increased translation losses 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during primarily because of the purchase of million of marketable securities  net of maturities  and the purchase of million of capital assets  partially offset by million of cash generated from operating activities and million of cash generated from financing activities 
our cash and cash equivalents fluctuate in part because of maturities of marketable securities  and investment of cash balances in marketable securities  or from other sources of cash  in addition to marketable securities 
accordingly  we believe the combined balances of cash and marketable securities provide a more reliable indication of our available liquidity 
our combined balances of cash and marketable securities increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  we generated million of cash from operations during cash generated from operations primarily included net income of million  which included net non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  provisions for inventory obsolescence and doubtful accounts of million  tax benefits from the exercise of stock options of  and increases in accounts payable of million 
this cash generated was adjusted by million related to the non cash deferred tax provision and offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  increases in inventory of  and increases in other assets of  as well as  reductions in accrued expenses of million 
increases in accounts payable are the result of increased inventory purchases 
the increase in deferred taxes resulted from the reversal of the valuation allowance established in increases in accounts receivable are due to higher revenue levels in the fourth quarter of  compared to  and proportionately more system sales through distributors  which increases the timing of receivable collections 
increases in inventory are the result of purchases to support higher order rates and backlog at the end of  compared to decreases in accrued expenses are primarily due to payment of incentive compensation accruals in we generated million of cash from operations during cash generated from operations primarily included net income of million  which included million of net non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  provision for inventory obsolescence  foreign deferred taxes and other non cash items  tax benefits from the exercise of stock options of  reduced accounts receivable of  advance customer payments of  and increased accrued expenses of million 
this cash generated more than offset investments in inventory of million and other assets of  as well as  reductions in accounts payable of million 
increased accrued expenses are primarily due to increased incentive and warranty accruals during investments in inventory are the result of significantly reduced revenues and order rates during the fourth quarter of  which caused build up in inventory as we aligned production rates with customer order rates 
reduced accounts payable are the result of lower levels of inventory purchases during the fourth quarter as we attempted to bring inventory levels down 
we used million of cash for investing activities during compared to million in changes in the level of investments in marketable securities  resulting from the purchases and maturities of those securities  used million of cash in and million of cash in we used approximately million of cash in and  of cash in for the purchase of fixed assets and capitalized patent costs and  of cash in for the acquisition of a patent license 
we generated approximately  of cash from financing activities during compared to million in cash generated from stock option exercises and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan was million in compared to million in during   of cash was used to repurchase common stock 
at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not believe we are exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we had no material commitments for expenditures as of december  while there were no material commitments  we evaluate investment opportunities that come to our attention and could make a significant commitment in the future 
our cash and equivalents and investments totaled million at december  we believe that on hand cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  coupled with anticipated future cash flow from operations  will be adequate to fund our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future  including contractual obligations discussed below 

table of contents the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
december in s total less than year years after years contractual obligations borrowings non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations   we lease a  square foot mixed office and warehouse facility built to our specifications in golden valley  minnesota  which functions as our corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility 
the lease for this space is set to expire in may we are presently negotiating a renewal of our lease 
purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding 
included in the purchase obligations category above are obligations related to purchase orders for inventory purchases under our standard terms and conditions and under negotiated agreements with vendors and utilities 
we expect to receive consideration products or services for these purchase obligations 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent all anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated 
the majority of our products and services are purchased as needed  with no contractual commitment 
consequently  these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis 
related party transactions on april   we loaned million to avanti optics corporation avanti  a company founded by steven k 
case  our chairman  founder and a significant shareholder of cyberoptics 
erwin kelen  one of our directors  also served as director of avanti  was a shareholder in avanti  and was a representative of one of the principal venture capital investors in avanti 
we held approximately of the outstanding capital stock of avanti prior to the loan  which we had acquired in consideration of the contribution of  cash and intellectual property to avanti when avanti was formed 
the loan transaction was approved by our board of directors without the participation of dr 
case or mr 
kelen and only after a determination that the loan was in our best interests 
the loan was represented by a convertible promissory note that bore interest at above the prime rate of interest and was repayable on april   or upon an earlier event of default 
the loan was secured by all of the intellectual property of avanti consisting primarily of rights in united states patents and patent applications in the area of photonics component manufacture  and provided us with the exclusive rights to manufacture and distribute manual and semi automated equipment for the assembly of surface mountable optical components that were under development by avanti 
during  we reduced the carrying value of the term loan by  to reflect our equity in the cumulative losses of avanti and to reduce our investment to reflect its net realizable value as of december  in december  we were notified that  as a result of not being able to raise additional third party funding  avanti decided to cease operations and liquidate its remaining assets 
in february  avanti s board of directors and its significant shareholders passed a resolution to cease business operations 
consequently  all of the avanti intellectual property rights were transferred to us under the terms of the loan 
at december   there is no remaining carrying value for the loan 
inflation and foreign currency translation changes in our revenues have resulted primarily because of changes in the level of unit shipments and the relative strength of the worldwide electronics and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets 
we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
all of our international export sales are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
accordingly  although currency fluctuations do not significantly affect our revenue and income per unit  they can influence the price competitiveness of our products and the willingness of existing and potential customers to purchase units 
we have sales offices located in the uk and singapore  and opened a sales office in china during we do not believe that currency fluctuations will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents recent accounting developments in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period 
originally  sfas no 
r was effective for all stock based awards granted beginning with the first interim period after june  on april   the securities and exchange commission sec approved a new rule that changed the effective date of sfas no 
r for public companies to annual  rather than interim periods that begin after june  the standard may be adopted under either the modified prospective method or alternative methods  which allow for restatement of prior interim periods or prior years 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective method 
we presently estimate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will increase pre tax expenses for the first quarter ending march  by approximately  the level of expenses in subsequent periods will be impacted by the number of future stock option grants  forfeiture rates and fluctuations in our stock price and volatility levels 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  inventory cost and amendment of arb no 
sfas requires idle facility expenses  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage costs to be recognized as current period charges 
it also requires that allocations of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   and we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on january  we do not believe that adoption of sfas no 
will impact our operating results in sfas no 
could impact our results in the future  during a severe market downturn  if utilization of our fixed production capacity falls below our normal capacity level 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  intangible assets  income taxes  and restructuring costs 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates and judgments that we believe have the most effect on our reported financial position and results of operations are as follows allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider specific accounts  historical write offs  changes in customer relationships and credit worthiness and concentrations of credit risk 
specific accounts receivable are written off once a determination is made that the account is uncollectible 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is  as of december  allowance for warranty expenses 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the allowance for warranties is  at december  reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if in the future we decide to discontinue sales and marketing of any of our products  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at december   we had a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of  
table of contents valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
for intangible assets and long lived assets  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from such asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we believe is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
annually  we also test for impairment of goodwill for each of our reporting units by estimating their fair value  utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology to determine a reasonable valuation 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
deferred tax assets 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principals 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our decision to record the valuation allowance was based on the cumulative losses we had incurred over the three years prior to that date  the fact that we were continuing to generate operating losses and that we fully utilized our loss carryback benefit in from the third quarter of through the third quarter of  we continued to provide a full valuation allowance against all future tax benefits produced by our operating results 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets initially established in the third quarter of  resulting in a non cash income tax benefit of million 
we considered a number of factors in our decision to reduce the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  including our anticipated level of profitability in the future  our history of recent profitability and cumulative profitability since inception  and utilization of our available us based net operating loss carryforwards 
after considering these factors  we concluded that a reduction in the valuation allowance was appropriate 
accordingly the benefit we will derive in future accounting periods from deductible temporary differences has been reflected as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess funds not required for current operations in marketable securities 
the investment policy for these marketable securities is approved annually by the board of directors and administered by management 
a third party  approved by our board of directors  manages the portfolio at the direction of our management 
the investment policy dictates that marketable securities consist of us government or us government agency securities or certain approved corporate instruments with maturities of three years or less and an average portfolio maturity of not more that months 
as of december  our portfolio of marketable securities had an average term to maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
we estimate that a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would decrease the market value of our marketable securities by approximately  if such a rate increase occurred  our net income would only be impacted if securities were sold prior to maturity 
we enter into foreign currency swap agreements to hedge short term inter company financing transactions with our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
these currency swap agreements are structured to mature near the last day of each quarter  and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   the company had one open swap agreement that was purchased on december  as a result  there were no unrealized gains or losses as of december  during the year ended december   we recognized a net gain of approximately  from settlement of foreign currency swap agreements that offset the approximately  translation loss on the underlying inter company balance 
our foreign currency swap agreements contain credit risk to the extent that our bank counter parties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
the company minimizes such risk by limiting its counter parties to major financial institutions 
we do not expect material losses as a result of defaults by other parties
