segment information our reportable segments are based on our operations in north america through greenfield online  inc  and its consolidated north american subsidiaries north america  and our operations in europe through ciao and its consolidated subsidiaries  europe 
both of our reportable segments conduct substantially similar businesses within a global marketplace  and the description of their businesses  market opportunities  customers  products and competitors is presented as a single business  except in circumstances where we believe that separate information related to a particular segment is necessary to understand our business as a whole 
while the comparison shopping business operated through our european segment is not an operating segment for fiscal year  we are presenting certain information about this business because we believe it helps readers understand our business and our european segment as a whole 
in  we did not have the ability to prepare discrete financial information for the comparison shopping business  which could have been reviewed by management 
we now believe that it is important to track the results of our comparison shopping business separately 
we intend to implement financial systems during allowing us to prepare discrete financial information for use by our management and others to review the financial performance of our comparison shopping business 
financial information about our reportable segments is included in our consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form k

this strategy culminated in the sale of our custom marketing research business the custom research business to taylor nelson sofres operations  inc tnso in january the sale of our custom research business represented a turning point in our development as we shifted from a labor intensive  professional services business model to a scalable internet based services business model

as part of this rightsizing effort we reduced north american staff by positions  which we believe will result in a reduction in annual salary and benefits costs of approximately million 
as part of the rightsizing plan we anticipate that in  offices in san francisco  california and durham  north carolina will be closed  and that our encino  california office will be reduced in size or moved to a smaller local facility 
we recorded pre tax charges in the fourth quarter of of  related to this rightsizing plan in connection with employee severance and benefit costs 
we estimate that we will record additional charges for costs and expenses related to this rightsizing plan in the first two quarters of in connection with the shut down of our san francisco  california office and the downsizing of our encino  california office  as well as charges related to employee severance  benefits and other costs 
we expect to complete this north american rightsizing plan by the end of the second quarter of we conducted our initial review of goodwill and other intangible assets as of october  and determined that impairment existed 
we therefore  recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million related to goodwill  and a million pre tax impairment charge related to other intangible assets  for the year ended december  
table of contents explanation of key financial statement captions net revenues we report our revenues net of customer volume rebates and cash discounts 
discounts for larger customers typically range from to off of our standard rates and we typically limit volume rebates to a few customers 
these rebates have not been material in amount historically  nor do we expect them to be material in the near future 
our net revenues are derived primarily from the following offerings full service we program our clients surveys  host them on our website infrastructure  invite our panelists to take the surveys and deliver the compiled data to our clients for their analysis and presentation to their clients 
sample solutions clients that have their own programming capabilities  but have limited or no access to survey respondents  can purchase controlled access to our internet panels 
in and  our net revenues from full service had been slightly higher than our sample solutions 
our relative mix of revenues has shifted in favor of sample solutions during  due primarily to the acquisitions of gozing in february and ciao in april as a result of their higher percentage of sample solutions revenues  which were greater than we had experienced previously 
we typically experience a lag of approximately two months between the time a bid for a project is submitted and the time the project is awarded 
we monitor forward delivery demand using the bid data maintained on our customer relationship management software and the win rate derived from this data in order to plan operational needs  such as the need to hire or reassign delivery personnel  and panel growth needs and composition 
once awarded  our typical project is usually completed in less than days 
we track the costs incurred on each project and defer cost recognition until such time as the project is delivered to the client 
upon delivery  the costs associated with the project are expensed and revenue is recognized 
for our comparison shopping business  we generate revenues from e commerce commissions and advertising income 
the core of this business consists of attracting visitors to our shopping portals  and referring these visitors to the websites of our online merchant clients 
whenever a visitor is referred from us to a client s website  a click through is recorded both by us and by the client 
at the end of each month  the total number of click throughs in that month is calculated  multiplied by the cost per click through agreed to contractually with the client  and the resulting sum is invoiced and recognized as revenue in that month 
advertising revenues are generated from the display of customer advertising on our ciao comparison shopping portals 
in this case  an advertising serving software is used to measure the number of page views that the advertising message has received in each month 
we and our advertising customers both have access to this software to verify the number of page views 
we only invoice and recognize revenues once an advertising campaign has been achieved in full  which occurs when the contractually agreed upon number of page views has been reached 
cost of revenues our direct costs associated with generating revenues primarily consist of the following items project personnel project personnel have three distinct roles project management  survey programming and data processing 
we maintain project personnel in the united states  europe  canada and india 
labor costs are specifically allocated to each project 
we utilize a timekeeping system in which project personnel maintain estimates of time incurred for each specific project 
project personnel are paid quarterly bonuses 
table of contents based upon service quality  achievement of revenue goals associated with clients as well as achievement of corporate profit objectives 
panelist incentives our panelists receive cash and non cash incentives for participating in our surveys 
we maintain an incentive account for each member of our internet panels 
our panelists accrue incentives based upon a member qualifying for and completing a survey within a predetermined timeframe 
the panel member may request and receive payment of his or her incentives at any point in time prior to expiration 
incentives generally expire one year after award as outlined in the terms and conditions available on our panelist website 
in february  we reduced the expiration threshold for panelists incentives from one year to six months 
data processing we perform the majority of the processing of survey data with our own professionals 
occasionally  we outsource certain data processing functions to third party suppliers 
outside sample we supplement our sample with survey responses from individuals who are not members of our internet panels 
these situations occur where our internet panels cannot meet customer demands because of timing  capacity or demographic constraints  or when we are asked to supply survey responses in markets in which we do not have panelists  typically certain international geographic sectors 
other direct costs other direct costs may include the following i fees paid to a third party for healthcare related sample data retrieved from a panel of healthcare professionals developed by this third party and ii fees paid to microsoft corporation microsoft for surveys completed and sold using data from panelists we have obtained through the microsoft network msn 
also included in other direct costs are unearned stock based compensation charges  which are amortized over the service period of options granted to project personnel 
amortization of internal use software we include in cost of revenues amortization of capitalized software costs related to survey production 
selling  general and administrative expenses as of december   we employed individuals that support the sales and marketing of our internet survey solutions 
these sales professionals are compensated based upon project delivery and revenue recognition 
commissions are accrued when we deliver completed projects to our clients 
in addition  we maintain our internet panels with a staff of eight panel management personnel 
these individuals design programs geared toward panelist recruitment  retention and incentives and are also responsible for panel database design and development 
furthermore  we support our internet survey solutions sales effort with a staff of six marketing professionals who design product  pricing  promotional and distribution strategies 
as of december   we employed individuals who provide a foundation for these functions in the areas of executive  finance  human resources and information technology operations 
this group is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure and support for the entire sales  delivery and panel teams 
also included in selling  general and administrative expenses are unearned stock based compensation charges  which are amortized over the service period of options granted to selling  general and administrative personnel 
panel acquisition expenses we continually add new members to our internet panels in order to support growing demand for our products and services as well as to replace members who leave the panel in the ordinary course of our business 
we incur costs to acquire members for our panel  including fees paid to procure new panelists from our webmaster affiliate program 
table of contents and through panel acquisition agreements with large internet portals  special interest  age and ethnicity related websites 
we also incur costs related to testing potential panel sources before full recruitment roll outs begin on specific websites and other costs associated with the panel recruitment process 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
we may also add members to our internet panels by acquiring existing panels  as we did with our recent acquisitions 
in these cases  where we acquire the panel as part of an ongoing business  we are able to capitalize the fair value of the panel we acquire and amortize that fair value to operating expense over the estimated life of the acquired asset 
in connection with panel members acquired as a result of the opinionsurveys 
com  rapidata  gozing and ciao acquisitions  approximately million of amortization expense was included in panel acquisition expenses for the year ended december  research and development expenses we employ a staff of professional technology personnel who develop proprietary solutions for panel database development  the development of internal use software and integrating client and third party software solutions into our technology infrastructure 
we also maintain a staff of professional technology personnel focused on the technology needs of our comparison shopping business in europe 
all costs associated with research and product development efforts are expensed as incurred and recorded under research and development expenses 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  costs relating to survey software development that meet the criteria for capitalization under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap are capitalized and amortized over the estimated period of benefit  usually two years 
impairment and restructuring charges in we incurred impairment and restructuring charges as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form k 
related party interest expense  net related party interest income expense  net is comprised of i paid in kind interest  calculated using the level yield method on the note we issued to greenfield holdings  llc in the principal amount of approximately million in may the holdings note  ii amortization of debt discount on the holdings note  iii interest expense on the notes issued to us by hugh o 
davis  one of our executive officers  and rudy nadilo  a former chief executive officer  and iv the accretion on the series c redeemable non voting preferred stock beginning in july all of the outstanding shares of the series c redeemable non voting preferred stock were redeemed in connection with our initial public offering in july 
benefit provision for income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities on differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
further  deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected realization of available net operating loss carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to an amount that we expect to realize in the future 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize these benefits if a reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that these benefits will be realized 
in addition  we continuously evaluate our tax contingencies and recognize a liability when we believe that it is probable that a liability exists 

table of contents treatment of sale of custom research business we do not believe that the sale of the custom research business qualified for discontinued operations treatment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  because i the business was not run separately from the internet survey solutions business  ii a single income statement and cash flow statement was prepared on a combined basis for internal reporting purposes  iii we never attempted to capture and track cash flows of the custom research business separately  and it would be impracticable for us to retrospectively develop meaningful information regarding these cash flows  and iv we had continuing involvement in the business under our alliance agreement  as both tnsi and its end customers relied on us to fulfill our obligations under contracts in process and as principal supplier of internet research to tnsi during the term of the agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience  independent instructions  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
for our internet survey solutions business  we recognize revenues for services when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenues to be realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  survey data delivery has occurred in accordance with the terms of the arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our products are delivered within a short period generally ranging from a few days to eight weeks 
an appropriate deferral is made for costs related to projects in process 
billings rendered in advance of services being performed  as well as customer deposits received in advance  are included in deferred revenue 
provision for estimated project losses  if any  is made in the period such losses are determined and estimable 
provision for rebates offered to certain customers are recorded against revenue in the period that such rebates are earned 
for our comparison shopping business  we generate revenues from e commerce commissions and advertising income 
the core of this business consists of attracting visitors to our comparison shopping portals  and referring these visitors to the websites of our merchant clients 
whenever a visitor is referred from us to a client s website  a click through is recorded both by us and by the client 
at the end of each month  the total number of click throughs in that month is calculated  multiplied by the cost per click through agreed contractually with the client  and the resulting sum is invoiced and recognized as revenue in that month 
advertising revenues are generated from the display of customer advertising on our ciao comparison shopping portals 
in this case  an advertising serving software is used to measure the number of page views  which the advertising message has received in each month 
we and our advertising customers both have access to this software to verify the number of page views 
we only invoice and 
table of contents recognize revenues once an advertising campaign has been achieved in full  which occurs when the contractually agreed upon number of page views has been reached 
accounts receivable allowances 
accounts receivable allowances are comprised of an allowance for doubtful accounts and allowances for customer credits  including volume rebates to certain of our larger customers 
volume rebate allowances are accrued based upon estimated volume rebates to be earned in connection with client contracts 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are arrived at using a two step methodology which takes into consideration specifically identified bad debts and an overall reserve for the entire receivable asset 
the allowance for bad debts as reflected at december  and represented our best estimate of identified bad debts in our internet survey solutions business 
we continue to refine our estimates for bad debts in our new internet survey solutions business over time and have adjusted the required allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of our experience 
while credit loss rates have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  fluctuations in our future credit rate losses may negatively impact our financial results 
during the year ended december   we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to specifically address the risk associated with international expansion 
panelist incentives 
our panelists receive incentives for participating in our surveys  which are earned by the panelist when we receive a timely survey response 
a panelist has the right to claim his or her incentive payment at any time prior to its expiration  which is generally one year 
in february  we reduced the expiration threshold for panelists incentives from one year to six months 
in our north american segment we accrue incentives as incurred  and reverse expirations to the statement of operations as the expirations occur 
in our european segment accrued incentives are recorded net of estimated expirations 
in april  we began offering a program emphasizing prize based incentives  whereby the respondent is entered into a drawing with a chance to win a larger cash prize 
panel acquisition expenses 
costs associated with establishing and maintaining panels of potential survey respondents are expensed as incurred 
these costs include amortization of capitalized panel acquisitions costs associated with acquired businesses with panels of survey respondents  as well as payments to third parties who source panelists from their databases and websites 
stock based compensation 
we have elected to follow accounting principle board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock based compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value method provided for under financial accounting standard no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
in and  we granted certain options to purchase our common stock at exercise prices that were subsequently determined to be less than the fair value of our common stock and  as a result  we recorded deferred stock based compensation expense  which is amortized to earnings over the service period of the employee 
in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we provide pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas accounting for equity instruments granted or sold by us under apb  sfas and emerging issues task force abstract  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods and services  requires fair value estimates of the equity instrument granted or sold 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments are too high or too low  our expenses may be overstated or understated 
for equity instruments granted or sold in exchange for the receipt of goods or services and for which the value of those goods or services cannot be readily estimated  as is true in connection with most stock options and warrants granted to employees and non employees  we estimate the fair value of the equity instruments based upon consideration of factors that we deem to be relevant at the time 

table of contents currently  our equity incentive plans provide that the value of a unit of equity incentive is to be determined on the date of grant with reference to the closing sale price for a share of our common stock or closing bid  if no sale was reported as quoted on the nasdaq national market 
prior to the existence of a public trading market for our common stock  our board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors in determining the fair value of our common stock 
at the time of option grants and other stock issuances  our board of directors considered the liquidation preferences  dividend rights  voting control and anti dilution protection attributable to our then outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock  the status of private and public financial markets  valuations of comparable private and public companies  the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event  our existing financial resources  our anticipated capital needs  dilution to common stockholders from anticipated future financings and a general assessment of future business risks  as such conditions existed at the time of the grant 
subsequent events or conditions that differ from these factors could have a material impact on stock compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are determined under the asset and liability approach 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
further  deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected benefits of available net operating loss carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to an amount which we expect to realize in the future 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize these benefits only as our reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that these benefits will be realized 
the reassessment requires us to review the positive and negative evidence available regarding the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
during the year ended december   we fully released the valuation allowance that had been recorded against our domestic deferred tax asset as we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize such deferred tax assets in the future 
this assessment was based upon successive quarters of operating profits and expected future profitability as well as acquisitions that have been integrated into our operations and minimal future expected acquisition integration costs associated with the gozing and ciao acquisitions 
during the year ended december   we recorded a valuation allowance against certain foreign deferred tax assets that primarily relate to net operating losses 
we do not believe that these deferred foreign tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
in addition  we continuously evaluate our tax contingencies and recognize a liability when we believe that it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated 
net loss income per share 
we report net loss income per share in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
earnings per share sfas 
under sfas  basic earnings per share  which excludes dilution  is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could be exercised or converted into common shares  and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive potential common shares 
for the years ended december  and  diluted earnings per share includes in the money stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method and also includes the assumed conversion of preferred stock using the if converted method if dilutive 
for periods prior to our initial public offering ipo on july   due to the participation features of our series a convertible participating preferred stock  series b preferred stock convertible participating preferred stock  and series c convertible participating preferred stock  basic and diluted earnings per share have been calculated using the two class method  which is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings 
in loss periods  no amounts are allocated to the participating securities 
during a loss period  the assumed exercise of in the 
table of contents money stock options and warrants and the conversion of convertible preferred stock has an anti dilutive effect and therefore  these instruments are excluded from the computation of dilutive earnings per share 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair values of the net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we do not amortize goodwill  but instead it is tested for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist  and at least on an annual basis 
in performing the annual impairment test  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
in the event that a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  we would record an adjustment to the respective reporting unit s goodwill for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value 
our primary measure of fair value is based on discounted cash flows 
the measurement of fair value and resulting impairment requires management to make estimates of these cash flows related to goodwill and long lived assets as well as other fair value determinations 
we conducted our initial review as of october  and determined that an impairment of goodwill existed 
we therefore  recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million for the year ended december   which is included in impairment and restructuring charges in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
we determined the fair value of our reporting units by discounting the cash flow projections at a discount rate  reflecting a risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital 
the results of our analysis indicated that goodwill was impaired in our european business segment 
the primary reason for the impairment was the weaker than anticipated revenue and cash flow growth of our european business segment as a result of increased competition from new entrants  pricing pressure and flat revenue and bid volume during the last three quarters of long lived assets 
we review other long lived assets  including property and equipment and internal use software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
management determines whether there has been any impairment on such assets by comparing anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of any resulting impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying value to the fair value  which is estimated  primarily using the present value of the estimated future cash flows

the decrease in stock based compensation expense as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to the increase in revenues year over year with a slight decline in stock based compensation expense in absolute dollars 
we expect gross profit to continue to decline as a percentage of revenue in the near term due to moderate pricing pressure and the introduction of new costs into cost of goods sold such as fees paid to our affiliates for random internet sampling performed on the worldwide web 
in addition we expect gross profit to remain variable from quarter to quarter as a result of shifts in product mix among full service  sample only  business to business  healthcare and outside sample projects  which product mix remains largely unpredictable

although our receivables and corresponding days sales outstanding increased  a significant portion of this increase occurred from business generated in december  which resulted in large accounts receivable balances remaining current as of december  the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was due primarily to increased insurance coverage that we obtained to manage the additional risk of operating as a public company  accrued interest receivable from our investments  which resulted from the excess proceeds from our common stock offerings  security deposits on current lease obligations and to increased deferred project costs 
these increases in working capital were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable  which resulted from additional expenses incurred attributable to our increased personnel and costs related thereto  and to expanded international operations  including overhead costs

in the event that somerset capital declined to continue to finance our capital expenditure requirements  we believe that alternative sources of such funding would be available to us to satisfy such needs 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
in the year ended december   we incurred capital expenditures of million and million related to north america and europe  respectively  including amounts financed through capital leases 
for fiscal  we expect capital expenditures to total approximately to million and capital lease payments to total approximately million 
the capital expenditures are primarily for developing internal use software for our internet survey solutions and comparison shopping businesses as well as for adding computer and networking capacity in north america and europe 
in the united states and europe  capital expenditures were applied primarily to the development of internal use software and to upgrade computer servers and networking equipment to manage increased internet based survey production and data collection 
these capital expenditures were funded by a combination of capital leases from somerset capital and cash flow from operations 
in the future  we expect that these costs will be funded from our cash flow from operations 

table of contents contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations during the year ended december   except for the restructuring and management change commitments as discussed further below 
additionally  due primarily to our recent acquisitions  our external commitments have increased significantly 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods years ended december  total at december  and thereafter in thousands contractual obligations capital lease obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations management change commitments restructuring commitments other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations these management change commitments are a result of our recent management change as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the restructuring charge commitments are a result of our recently announced rightsizing plan in north america as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that our cash generated from operations will be adequate to finance our working capital and other capital expenditure requirements through the foreseeable future  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
we believe we are more likely than not to realize our domestic and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets in the future  which could result in future cash savings  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses  acquisitions of technologies  businesses or assets or strategic investments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect 
there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or  if available  that the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then current stockholders 
impact of inflation our results are affected by the impact of inflation primarily on production  operating costs and interest rates 
the effects of inflation in changing prices on our net revenues and operations have not been material in the last three fiscal years 
however  there has been deflationary pressure on selling prices  which requires us to monitor our operating costs and efficiencies 
due to the competitive nature of the marketing research industry  there can be no assurance that this negative pressure will not continue 
historically  we have used selling price adjustments  cost containment programs and improved operating efficiencies to offset the otherwise negative impact of inflation on our operations

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we operate primarily in the united states and europe 
however  our business is expanding both in the united states and internationally and as a result we are exposed to certain market risks that arise in the normal course of business  including fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
these risks are not expected to be material 
however  no assurance can be given that such risks will not become material 
while we have not used derivative financial instruments in the past  we may  on occasion  use them in the future in order to manage or reduce these risks 
we do not expect to enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate and debt sensitivity as of december  and  we had borrowings under capital leases of approximately million and million  respectively  most of which bear interest at fixed rates 
as such  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 
however  should we enter into other debt arrangements which bear interest at floating rates  actual increases or decreases in earnings and cash flows in the future could differ materially from our historical experience based on the timing and amount of both interest rate changes and amounts borrowed by us 
as of december  and  we had a balance of cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
if and to the extent that these funds were invested in interest bearing instruments during the entire period  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the rate of interest payable on these invested funds would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows for the year ended december   but would have had a material effect of  for the year ended december  the change in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is due to a lower balance of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year 
currency exchange rate sensitivity during the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states 
prior to our acquisition of ciao in april and for the year ended december   the effects of currency rate fluctuations were not material 
since this acquisition  our results of operations were and continue to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could have a material impact on our financial results 
our policy is to hedge the impact of currency rate fluctuations only for large transactions  which could have a material impact on our financial results 
due to the relatively small transaction size and the short duration of our operating cycle  we do not typically utilize hedges as the costs associated with hedging outweigh the potential benefits 
however  we will continue to monitor such exposures and utilize hedges such as foreign currency exchange forward contracts should we believe that a particular transaction could have a material impact on our financial results 
we performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and holding all other variables constant  and assuming a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  the analysis indicated that such a market movement would affect our pre tax income by approximately  at december   and by an immaterial amount at december  however  actual gains and losses in the future could differ materially from this analysis based on the timing and amount of both foreign currency exchange rate movements and our actual revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies
