item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations consolidated results of operations and financial condition overview we are a global market leader in design  development  manufacturing  sale and support of commercial jetliners  military aircraft  satellites  missile defense  human space flight and launch systems and services 
we are one of the two major manufacturers of seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and the second largest defense contractor in the us while our principal operations are in the us  we rely extensively on a network of partners  key suppliers and subcontractors located around the world 
our business strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses commercial airplanes and integrated defense systems ids supplemented and supported by boeing capital corporation bcc 
taken together  these core businesses generate substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services and to open new frontiers in aerospace 
we are focused on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality 
ids is a defense systems business that integrates its resources in defense  intelligence  communications and space to deliver capability driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs 
our strategy is to overlay the strong positions in commercial airplanes and ids with a simultaneously intense focus on growth and productivity 
our strategy also benefits as commercial and defense markets often offset each others cyclicality 
bcc delivers value through supporting our business units and reducing our customer financing exposures 
boeing technology  our advanced research and development unit  provides new systems  technologies and processes to position us for future growth 
connexion by boeing sm makes an airplane seem more like the office or home with internet connection anytime and anywhere 
our financial results improved significantly in over revenues grew by percent  operating earnings grew by  operating margin increased by percentage points and fully diluted earnings per share grew by 
we continued to invest in key growth programs and research and development expense grew by to billion  primarily reflecting increased spending on our new aircraft 
we generated operating cash flow of billion after contributing billion to our pension plans 
we reduced debt by billion and repurchased more than million shares 
our contractual backlog grew to billion  driven by growth at commercial airplanes while our total backlog grew to billion 
our major businesses delivered strong performance in commercial airplanes grew revenues by to billion while operating earnings increased by to billion or of revenues compared with operating margins of of revenues in ids revenues grew by to a record billion  operating earnings increased to billion and operating earnings as a percent of revenues were in up from in a gain of million from the sale of rocketdyne in increased ids operating margin by 
bcc grew revenue by and increased operating earnings by 
the operating earnings growth at our major businesses was partially offset by higher expenses for pension and share based plans 
we expect strong growth in commercial airplane revenues and deliveries as we execute our record backlog and respond to global demand 
we are ramping up commercial aircraft production and are focused on successfully executing our backlog 
we expect ids revenue growth to moderate as we anticipate that the us department of defense us dod budget will remain relatively flat over the next several years 
we are focused on improving financial performance through a combination of productivity and customer focused growth 

table of contents consolidated results of operations revenues higher consolidated revenues in were primarily due to the growth at commercial airplanes driven by higher new aircraft deliveries  increased spares and aircraft modifications  and higher used aircraft sales 
ids revenues remained stable in after strong growth in bcc revenues were essentially unchanged in consolidated revenues also increased in as compared to the increase was driven by strong growth at ids defense and intelligence businesses 
despite increased new aircraft deliveries  commercial airplanes revenues declined in the decline is primarily due to delivery mix as more single aisle aircraft and fewer twin aisle aircraft were delivered in bcc revenues were down slightly in operating earnings our operating earnings increased primarily due to strong operating performance by our business segments  which are discussed in the segment results of operations and financial condition on page  partially offset by higher pension and share based plan expenses 
sharply higher operating earnings in compared to were primarily due to higher operating earnings by ids 
included in results is a charge of million related to the united states air force usaf tanker program and expenses incurred to end production of the aircraft 
included in results are goodwill impairment charges of million recorded at ids and million recorded at commercial airplanes 
in addition  earnings were further impacted by a second quarter charge of  million  of which million was attributable to the delta iv program and million to boeing satellite systems incurring additional costs as a result of satellite program complexities 
the following table shows operating earnings and corporate items not allocated to our segments dollars in millions year ended december  commercial airplanes integrated defense systems boeing capital corporation other segment items not allocated to segments earnings from continuing operations the most significant items not allocated to segments are shown in the following table year ended december  pension and post retirement expense income share based plans expense deferred compensation expense other total items not allocated to segments pension and other post retirement accounting differences represent difference between costs recognized under gaap in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for us government contracting purposes 
higher pension and post retirement amounts in are primarily related to higher amortization of actuarial losses and net settlement and curtailment losses due to divestitures 
the increase in from is due to higher gaap pension expense in reflecting higher amortization of 
table of contents actuarial losses 
the increase in share based plans expense is primarily due to the increase in our stock price which resulted in additional compensation expense due to an increase in the number of performance shares meeting the price growth targets and being converted to common stock 
the increase in deferred compensation plans expense is also due to the increase in our stock price 
income taxes the effective income tax rate of differed from the federal statutory tax rate of  primarily due to a settlement with the internal revenue service irs for the years  foreign sales corporation fsc and extraterritorial income eti tax benefits  reversal of valuation allowances  and other provision adjustments 
the effective income tax rate of differed from the federal statutory tax rate of  due to fsc and eti tax benefits  tax benefits from a settlement with the irs for the years  tax benefits associated with state tax audit settlements  and other provision adjustments 
for further discussion related to income taxes see note net earnings net earnings increased in compared to largely due to higher operating earnings 
interest and debt expense was lower as we continued to pay down our debt in net earnings increased in compared to primarily due to higher operating earnings which was partially offset by lower other income and higher income taxes 
additionally  included in net earnings is a million net gain on bcc s sale of a substantial portion of its commercial financial services business 
other income primarily consists of interest income 
other income included interest of million in  million in and million in related to federal income tax settlements for prior years 
additionally in  other income included higher income from marketable securities and an asset impairment charge for certain investments in technology related funds and partnerships 
we early adopted the provisions of sfas no

upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we recorded an increase in net earnings of million  net of taxes of million  as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
for performance shares awarded in  the fair value of each award is estimated using a monte carlo simulation model instead of the grant date market price used for previous awards 
additionally  we now amortize compensation cost for share based awards granted after january  for retirement eligible employees using the non substantive vesting approach instead of amortizing over the stated vesting period see note 
backlog contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options  announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed  and unobligated us and foreign government contract funding 
the increase in contractual backlog from to primarily relates to new orders for the   and the increase was partially offset by a decrease in ids contractual backlog 
the increase in contractual backlog from to related primarily to new orders for the and the increase was partially offset by a decrease in ids contractual backlog 

table of contents unobligated backlog includes us and foreign government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized 
the decrease in unobligated backlog in is mainly due to strong sales in c and f programs for multi year contracts awarded in prior years 
for segment reporting purposes  we include airplanes ordered by other segments in commercial airplanes contractual backlog 
commercial airplanes relieves contractual backlog upon delivery of these airplanes to other segments 
ids contractual backlog includes modifications to be performed on intracompany airplane purchases from commercial airplanes 
ids contractual backlog is reduced upon delivery to the customer or at the attainment of performance milestones 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of our liquidity and capital resources include cash flow from operations and substantial unused borrowing capacity through commercial paper programs  long term capital markets and revolving credit line agreements 
the primary factors that affect our investment requirements and liquidity position  other than operating results associated with current sales activity  include the following timing of new and derivative aircraft programs requiring both high developmental expenditures and initial inventory buildup  growth and contractions in business cycles  customer financing assistance  the timing of federal income tax payments refunds and contributions to our pension plans as well as interest  debt and dividend payments  our stock repurchase plan  internal investments  and acquisitions and divestitures

corresponding amounts are listed in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
working capital during the year ended december   our investment in working capital decreased 
this decrease is primarily due to the following lower pension contributions in compared to  decreased investment in customer financing  and higher advances and billings in excess of related costs 
these decreases in working capital were partially offset by increased investment in inventories 

table of contents working capital includes customer financing transactions primarily in the form of notes receivable  sales type finance leases and property subject to operating leases 
these transactions occur as the result of customer financing activities associated with items recorded in inventory 
the origination and subsequent principal collections for some of these transactions were previously presented as investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows  consistent with the presentation by bcc in their stand alone financial statements 
effective for the year ended december   we changed the classification of the cash flow effects of customer financing transactions based on views expressed by the securities and exchange commission sec staff 
the amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to be consistent with current year presentation 
for the years ended december   and  the net impact on operating cash flow was million  million and billion  respectively  for customer financing transactions 
during the year ended december   we received federal income tax refunds totaling million of which million represents interest 
these refunds related to the settlement of federal income tax audits for the tax years 
for the years ended december  and  we contributed billion and billion to our pension plans which are included in operating cash flow 
almost all of the and contributions were voluntary to improve the funded status of our plans 
investing activities in  cash used for investing activities decreased by billion compared to the decrease was primarily due to higher net contributions in to investment grade fixed income securities partially offset by lower proceeds from business dispositions in and higher property  plant and equipment additions in during  we invested billion of cash in an externally managed portfolio of investment grade fixed income instruments 
the portfolio is diversified and highly liquid and primarily consists of investment fixed income instruments us dollar debt obligations of the united states treasury  other government agencies  corporations  mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
as of december   the portfolio had an average duration of years 
we do not intend to hold these investments to maturity  nor do we intend to actively and frequently buy and sell these securities with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in price 
during  we received billion of cash proceeds from dispositions 
this is primarily related to the sale of our commercial airplanes operations in wichita  kansas  and tulsa and mcalester  oklahoma and the sale of rocketdyne 
during  we received cash of billion from the sale of a substantial portion of bcc s commercial financial services business 
property  plant and equipment additions increased by approximately billion to billion in financing activities cash used by financing activities increased to billion in from billion in primarily due to a billion increase in share repurchases partially offset by lower debt repayments 
during  we repurchased  shares at an average price of pursuant to our open market share repurchase program  and  shares in stock swaps 
during   shares were repurchased at an average price of pursuant to our open market share repurchase program  and  shares were repurchased in stock swaps 
there were no share repurchases in there were no debt issuances during and we issued approximately billion of debt in to refinance corporate debt that matured in and additionally  in  we received proceeds of billion under our september  shelf registration 
on july   bcc redeemed billion face value of its outstanding senior notes  which had a carrying value of million 
bcc recognized a net loss of million related to this early debt redemption see note

table of contents credit ratings our credit ratings are summarized below fitch moody s standard poor s long term boeing bcc a a a short term boeing bcc f p a on january   moody s placed both boeing and bcc s credit ratings senior unsecured long term ratings and short term ratings under review for possible upgrade 
capital resources we and bcc have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short term liquidity 
throughout and at december   neither we nor bcc had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
we believe we have substantial borrowing capacity 
currently  we have billion billion exclusively available for bcc of unused borrowing limits under revolving credit line agreements 
see note 
in november  we rolled over the day revolving credit facility  reducing it from billion to billion 
currently  there is million allocated to bcc 
we also rolled over the year credit facility we established in november  maintaining the total size of billion  of which million remains allocated to bcc 
we also have billion that remains available from a shelf registration filed with the sec on march  and bcc has an additional billion available for issuance 
we believe our internally generated liquidity  together with access to external capital resources  will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans  and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities 

table of contents disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december   and the estimated timing thereof 
contractual obligations dollars in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt including current portion interest on debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations not recorded on statement of financial position production related pension and other post retirement cash requirements purchase obligations recorded on statement of financial position total contractual obligations includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at december  variable rate debt was approximately of our total debt at december  purchase obligations purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  specify a fixed  minimum or range of quantities  specify a fixed  minimum  variable  or indexed price provision  and specify approximate timing of the transaction 
in addition  the agreements are not cancelable without a substantial penalty 
long term debt  interest on debt  capital leases  and operating leases are shown in the above table regardless of whether they meet the characteristics of purchase obligations 
purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the statements of financial position 
approximately of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost type government contracts 
purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position pension and other postretirement benefits pension cash requirements is an estimate of our minimum funding requirements  pursuant to the erisa regulations  although we may make additional discretionary contributions 
estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contribution to the one plan that is funded through a trust 
production related production related purchase obligations include agreements for production goods  tooling costs  electricity and natural gas contracts  property  plant and equipment  and other miscellaneous production related obligations 
the most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts 
we have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities  and long term delivery timeframes 
in addition  we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers 
these agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules 
the need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises due to the extended production planning horizon for many of our products  including commercial aircraft  military aircraft and other products where 
table of contents delivery to the customer occurs over an extended period of time 
a significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts from customers  and or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from such customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery 
these amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting 
some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments 
in these limited cases  we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above 
industrial participation agreements we have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers in foreign countries to effect economic flow back and or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies  as the result of their procurement of goods and or services from us 
these commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies  opportunities to bid on supply contracts  transfer of technology  or other forms of assistance to the foreign country 
however  in certain cases  our commitments may be satisfied through other parties such as our vendors who purchase supplies from our foreign customers 
we do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed 
in certain cases  penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments 
during  we incurred no such penalties 
as of december   we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling billion that extend through in cases where we satisfy our commitments through the purchase of supplies and the criteria described in purchase obligations are met  amounts are included in the table above 
to be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us  the foreign country or customer must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost  quality and schedule 
purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position purchase obligations recorded on the statement of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable 
off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees and variable interests in unconsolidated entities 
for discussion of these arrangements  see note commercial commitments the following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of december   as well as an estimate of when these commitments are expected to expire

segment results of operations and financial condition commercial airplanes business environment and trends airline industry environment gross domestic product gdp growth  the primary driver of air traffic growth  remained resilient in the face of rising energy prices in as a result  worldwide passenger traffic growth continued above the long term trend in following double digit growth in traffic growth outpaced capacity increases pushing world load factors to historical highs 
industry forecasts predict above average traffic growth through at least  although disease outbreaks  increasing armed conflict or terrorist attacks  and global economic imbalances represent ongoing risks 
crude oil prices have almost doubled since the beginning of in addition  the price differential between oil and jet fuel rose to historically high levels in  triple the average over the last years 
although economic indicators show that the world economy has adjusted to the current higher oil price levels without significant slowdown  the rise in jet fuel prices is outpacing airlines ability to increase revenues through fare hikes and fuel surcharges and is pressuring less efficient airlines in particular 
worldwide  many airlines continue to report operating profits although performance varies significantly by region and business model 
industry financials generally show increasing unit revenues and some improvement in fares 
combined with progress on cost cutting initiatives and efficiency improvements  these trends are helping many airlines remain profitable despite rising fuel prices and intense competition 
although the industry s aggregate financial health remains under the shadow of the us network carriers whose financial difficulties are forecast to push the industry into losses of billion in  the many airlines that are profitably growing to meet increased demand are acquiring new capacity from manufacturers 
the pace of air traffic rights liberalization between countries has been brisk during the past year with many new air service agreements having been signed or announced 
high growth markets including china and india announced multiple new agreements spurring the opening of new routes 
in addition  the united states and european union made significant advances towards open skies late in continued liberalization is an important factor in the growth and network development of commercial aviation 
looking forward  our year forecast is for a long term average growth rate of per year for passenger traffic  and per year for cargo traffic based on projected average annual worldwide real economic growth of 
based on long term global economic growth projections  and factoring in the increasingly competitive environment  increasing utilization levels of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes  we project a trillion market for  new airplanes over the next years 
while factors such as terrorism and increased ticket charges for security have had significant impact over the span of several years  they have not historically affected the longer term macro trends in the world economy  and therefore  our long term market outlook 
industry competitiveness the commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive 
we expect the existing long term downward trend in passenger revenue yields 
table of contents worldwide measured in real terms to continue into the foreseeable future 
market liberalization in europe and asia has continued to enable low cost airlines to gain market share 
these airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares 
this results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products 
major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins 
continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long term investment returns 
approximately two thirds of commercial airplanes third party sales and contractual backlog are from customers based outside the united states 
we face aggressive international competitors that are intent on increasing their market share 
they offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers 
airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours 
regional jet makers embraer and bombardier  coming from the less than seat commercial jet market  continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes 
this market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors 
worldwide  airplane sales are generally conducted in us dollars 
fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors  all of whom have significant costs in other currencies 
the decline of the us dollar relative to their local currencies in put pressure on competitors revenues and profits 
competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs  thereby improving their longer term competitive posture 
airbus is implementing such initiatives targeting more than reduction in costs by if the us dollar continues to strengthen as it has in  airbus can use the extra efficiency to develop new products and gain market share 
we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts 
we continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network for airlines throughout the world to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity 
these efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively and maintain satisfactory margins 
while we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction activities  events may occur that will prevent us from achieving planned results 
we continue to explore strategic options related to our operations at various sites to focus on large scale systems integration  which is where we are most competitive and can add the most value to our airplanes and services 
production disruption caused by labor strike we delivered fewer than expected airplanes due to the iam strike  during this reduced revenue by approximately billion for the twelve months ended december  new airline bankruptcies northwest airlines  inc northwest and delta air lines  inc 
delta filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on september  commercial airplanes does not expect a material impact on revenues or operating results due to these bankruptcy filings 
see note 
divestitures on june  we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets at our commercial airplanes facilities in wichita  kansas and tulsa and mcalester  oklahoma under an asset purchase agreement to a new entity  which was subsequently named spirit aerosystems  inc spirit and is owned by onex partners lp

the decline in revenue of billion in compared to was primarily due to new airplane model mix of billion and net reductions of million in other products 
commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of december  including deliveries under operating lease  which are identified by parentheses  were as follows model next generation total intracompany deliveries were two aircraft and two next generation aircraft in  three next generation aircraft in and three next generation aircraft in the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of december were as follows model next generation 
table of contents the undelivered units under firm order as of december were as follows model next generation firm orders represent new aircraft purchase agreements where the customers rights to cancel without penalty have expired 
typically customer rights to cancel without penalty include the customer receiving approval from its board of directors  shareholders  government and completing financing arrangements 
all such cancellation rights must be satisfied or expired prior to recording a firm order even if satisfying such conditions are highly certain 
firm orders exclude option aircraft and aircraft with cancellation rights 
operating earnings the million increase in operating earnings in over the comparable period of was primarily attributable to earnings on increased revenue from new aircraft deliveries of million and increased revenue from aircraft modification and other of million 
in addition  margin improved million mainly due to improved cost performance  which was offset by increased research and development costs of million and other period costs of million  and a loss on the sale of wichita  tulsa and mcalester operations of million 
in  we also had charges of million resulting from the decision to complete production of the program and million of usaf tanker program charge 
refer to ids discussion on page the increase of million in operating earnings in from was primarily attributable to million from improved program margins due to cost reduction initiatives and decreased period costs offset by lower earnings from the change in model mix of million  program termination charge of million  usaf tanker program charge of million and increased research and development expense of million 
additionally  in we had a goodwill impairment charge of million and a charge of million resulting from the decision to complete production of the program 
backlog the increase in backlog in compared to primarily relates to new orders for the  and the increase in backlog in compared to was primarily related to new orders for and accounting quantity for each airplane program  we estimate the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
we refer to this estimate as the accounting quantity 
the accounting quantity for each program is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout the life of a program 
see application of critical accounting policies program accounting 
estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program  such as firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers  and market studies 
we review and reassess our program accounting quantities on a quarterly basis in compliance with relevant program accounting guidance 
commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs  a portion of which do not vary with production rates 
as the amount of time needed to produce the accounting 
table of contents quantity decreases  the average cost of the accounting quantity also decreases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates  thus increasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change 
the estimate of total program accounting quantities and changes  if any  as of december were next generation additions additions deletions the accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered  undelivered units under contract  and units anticipated to be under contract in the future anticipated orders 
in developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be addressed 
the percentage of anticipated orders included in the program accounting estimates as compared to the number of cumulative firm orders as of december were as follows next generation cumulative firm orders cfo anticipated orders n a n a n a n a n a anticipated orders as a of cfo n a n a n a n a n a cumulative firm orders anticipated orders n a n a anticipated orders as a of cfo n a n a cumulative firm orders anticipated orders n a n a n a anticipated orders as a of cfo n a n a n a cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered units under firm order see tables in commercial airplanes revenues operating results discussion 
cumulative firm orders include orders that fall within the current accounting quantities as well as orders that extend beyond the current accounting quantities 
cumulative firm orders exclude program test aircraft that will not be refurbished for sale 
program the accounting quantity for the program has been based on firm orders since the fourth quarter of as of december   of the remaining undelivered units  units will be delivered to a single customer with uncertain financial condition 
as a result  on a consolidated basis  these aircraft will be accounted for under long term operating leases as they are delivered 
the value of the inventory for the undelivered aircraft as of december   remained realizable 
on january   we announced our decision to complete production of the airplane in due to the lack of overall market demand for the airplane 
the decision is expected to result in total pre tax charges of approximately million  of which million was incorporated in fourth quarter and year end results 
the last aircraft is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of see note 
table of contents next generation the accounting quantity for the next generation program increased by units during as a result of the programs normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft 
program the program accounting quantity was increased by units during as a result of additional customer orders 
in november  we launched the advanced as the family  which includes international passenger airplane and the freighter 
this launch and additional anticipated firm orders have extended the life of this program and have also solidified product strategy 
program due to lack of demand for the program  a decision was made in the third quarter of to complete production of the program 
production of the program ended in october the last aircraft was delivered in the second quarter of the vendor termination liability remaining in accounts payable and other liabilities was reduced from million to million during due to million in payments offset by an increase in estimate of million 
no future charges related to the airplane program are expected 
program during the achieved some success in obtaining additional orders 
as a result the accounting quantity for the program increased by twelve units during given the timing and changing requirements for new usaf tankers  the prospects for the current production program to extend uninterrupted into a usaf tanker contract has diminished 
we are continuing to pursue market opportunities for additional sales 
despite the recent airplane orders and the possibility of additional orders  it is still reasonably possible a decision to complete production could be made in a forward loss is not expected as a result of such a decision but program margins would be reduced

deferred production costs commercial aircraft inventory production costs incurred on in process and delivered units in excess of the estimated average cost of such units  determined as described in note represent deferred production costs 
as of december  and deferred production costs relate to the program and there were no significant excess deferred production costs or unamortized tooling costs not recoverable from existing firm orders 
the deferred production costs and unamortized tooling included in the program s inventory at december are summarized in the following table dollars in millions deferred production costs unamortized tooling as of december  and  the balance of deferred production costs and unamortized tooling related to all other commercial aircraft programs was insignificant relative to the programs balance to go cost estimates 
fleet support we provide the operators of all our commercial airplane models assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation 
collectively known as fleet support services  these activities and services include flight and maintenance training  field service support costs  engineering services and technical data and documents 
fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the 
table of contents customer receives training  manuals and technical consulting support  and continues throughout the operational life of the aircraft 
services provided after delivery include field service support  consulting on maintenance  repair  and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators  updating manuals and engineering data  and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model s fleet 
field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests 
the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than of total consolidated costs of products and services 
this level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years 
these costs do not vary significantly with current production rates 
research and development we continually evaluate opportunities to improve current aircraft models  and assess the marketplace to ensure that our family of commercial jet aircraft is well positioned to meet future requirements of the airline industry 
the fundamental strategy is to maintain a broad product line that is responsive to changing market conditions by maximizing commonality among our family of commercial aircraft 
additionally  we are determined to continue to lead the industry in customer satisfaction by offering products with the highest standards of quality  safety  technical excellence  economic performance and in service support 
our research and development spending increased million during and million in the increase in research and development during and was primarily due to increased spending on the program and was partially offset by supplier development cost sharing payments 
for  supplier development cost sharing payments received were million compared to million during we expect to receive a lesser amount of supplier development cost sharing payments in  which will result in an increase to our total research and development expense 
we are currently focusing our new airplane product development efforts on the program  which in three planned versions will seat to passengers in multiple class configurations 
in early  we received the initial launch order for the and board of directors bod approval to proceed with full development and production 
entry into service is targeted for we are also continuing to develop derivatives and features for our other programs primarily the  and programs

defense environment overview the us is faced with continuous force deployments overseas  stability operations in afghanistan and iraq  and the requirement both to recapitalize important defense capabilities and to transform the force to take advantage of available technologies to meet the changing national security environment as outlined in the recently released quadrennial defense review qdr report 
all of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant federal budget deficits and an administration pledge to reduce and ultimately eliminate annual deficit spending 
we anticipate that the national security environment will remain challenging for at least the next decade 
the global war on terrorism and the national security threats posed by weapons of mass destruction demand new and improved capabilities such as persistent intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance isr  global precision strike  and assured access to space 
recent operations in support of the global war on terrorism have demonstrated the value of networked and fused isr combined with advanced command  control and communications systems  interdependence across platforms  services  and special forces  and the leveraging effects of precise  persistent  and selective engagement 
all of these enable and leverage new capabilities while allowing use of traditional capabilities more discretely and in new ways 
the significance and advantage of unmanned systems to perform many of these tasks will continue to be investigated 
there is also recognition that technology must be coupled with human intelligence and ground forces to generate the greatest effect 
these opportunities and challenges are driving the u 
s 
department of defense dod  along with militaries worldwide  both friend and potential foe  to transform their forces and weapons systems as well as the way they use them 
because dod spending makes up about half of worldwide defense spending and represented greater than of ids revenue in  the trends and drivers associated with the dod budget are critical 
the dod budget has grown substantially over the past decade  particularly after the terrorist attacks of september   and we ve seen that trend continue in the presidential budget submittal  although at a moderated rate compared to the last few years 
the president s request for fiscal year is billion  excluding supplemental appropriations required by ongoing military operations in afghanistan and iraq 
this is a increase over the enacted fiscal year funding level of billion 
although the top line had continued to experience growth in the last couple of years  we had seen pressure on the investment accounts procurement and research  development  test evaluation rdt e 
the portion of the defense budget allocated to dod procurement decreased between fiscal year and and again in conversely  in the presidential budget request  the procurement account increased by about and the rdt e account increased by slightly more than when compared to the enacted funding levels 
all projections and percentage increases are made without taking inflation into account 
we anticipate that the overall dod budget will remain in the range of the request or slightly lower over the next four to five years 
even though we continue to see some growth in the dod budget  it is unlikely that the dod will be able to fully fund the hardware programs already in development as well as new initiatives in order to address the capability gaps identified in the qdr 
this imbalance between future costs of hardware programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the dod and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules  restructuring programs  and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding 

table of contents we expect the dod will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies that emphasize jointness  network centric operations  persistent isr  long range strike  special operations  unmanned systems  precision guided kinetic and non kinetic weapons  and continued privatization of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs 
evolving national challenges will be met by reallocating funds within the department 
this will provide opportunities for ids products in the future 
we are already seeing the need for the military to make difficult choices between programs in an effort to fill their highest priority capability gaps 
the dod is also expected to continue to examine the force structure  including personnel and equipment requirements  in search of opportunities to improve business processes and reduce overall manpower 
programs will continually be evaluated by performance and relevancy relative to required dod capabilities and enduring needs 
civil space transportation and exploration environment congress approved close to full funding of nasa s fiscal year and budget requests  including needed funds for space shuttle operations  international space station  and new initiatives associated with the vision for space exploration 
nasa s fiscal year appropriation of billion is approximately equal to the fiscal year funding level 
funding at this level or a slightly higher is projected into the future as evidenced by the presidential budget request of billion 
nasa is continuing to pursue elements of the vision for space exploration  which will provide additional opportunities 
commercial space environment the commercial space market has softened significantly since the late s in conjunction with the downturn in the telecommunications industry 
this market is now characterized by overcapacity  aggressive pricing and limited near term opportunities 
recent projections indicate these market conditions will persist until the end of this decade 
we believe there will be fewer commercial satellite orders for the next few years with a slight upturn to meet replacement demand near the end of the decade  but we do not project recovery equal to the demand of the early to mid s 
in this extremely limited market  we see continued manufacturing overcapacity  which in turn is driving continued deterioration of pricing conditions 
we will continue to pursue profitable commercial satellite opportunities where the customer values our technical expertise and unique solutions eg  directv and mobile satellite ventures 
in the launch market  we continue to focus our delta iv program on the government launch market only  but we offer the capabilities of the sea launch system  described below  in the commercial launch area 
sea launch the sea launch venture  in which we are a partner  provides ocean based launch services to commercial satellite customers and is reported in the l os segment 
for the year ended december   the venture conducted four successful launches 
we have issued credit guarantees to creditors of the sea launch venture to assist the venture in obtaining financing 
in the event we are required to perform on these guarantees  we have the right to recover a portion of the cost from other venture partners 
we believe our net exposure to loss from sea launch at december  totals million 
the components of this exposure are as follows dollars in millions maximum exposure established reserves estimated proceeds from recourse net exposure credit guarantees partner loans principal and interest advances to provide for future launches trade receivable from sea launch performance guarantees other receivables from sea launch 
table of contents we made no additional capital contributions to the sea launch venture during the year ended december  delta the usaf lifted the evolved expendable launch vehicle eelv suspension on march  see note after this action  we were awarded a contract to provide infrastructure sustainment related to delta iv launches 
in addition  on june  we submitted a proposal in response to the initial request for proposals for the eelv buy iii program 
buy iii contracts are expected to be issued to us and lockheed martin corporation lockheed and may ultimately include up to launches and additional infrastructure sustainment funding 
the cost estimates for the delta ii and delta iv programs are based in part upon estimated quantities and timing of launch missions for existing and anticipated contracts  referred to as the mission manifest  to determine the allocation of fixed costs to individual launches 
revenue estimates include probable price adjustments due to contractual statement of work changes where we have established contractual entitlement 
if these price adjustments do not occur  it could impact the financial performance of the delta programs 
the mission manifest represents management s best estimate of the launch services market taking into account all known information 
due to the volatility of the government launch market  it is possible that changes in quantity and timing of launches could occur that would change the mission manifest and  therefore  the financial performance of the delta programs 
we have delta iv inventory of billion and fixed assets of billion that may be subject to impairment if we are unable to obtain future contracts and appropriate pricing 
based on the mission manifest estimated quantities and timing of launch missions for existing and anticipated contracts we believe we will recover these costs 
the delta ii and iv programs are reported in the l os segment 
satellites as is the standard for the commercial satellite industry  contracts are fixed price in nature and include on orbit incentive payments 
many of the existing satellite programs have very complex designs including unique phased array antenna designs 
as technical or quality issues arise  we have continued to experience schedule delays and cost impacts 
if the issues continue  they could result in a material charge 
these programs are ongoing  and while we believe the cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of the satellites creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed  which could trigger termination for default tfd provisions or other financially significant exposure 
we have one commercial satellite program that could expose us to a tfd notification risk of million 
management believes a tfd is not likely due to continued performance to contract requirements and continuing contractual efforts in process 
our satellite programs are reported in either the network systems or l os segments 
see discussion of boeing satellite systems international  inc bssi ico global communications operations  ltd 
ico litigation in note on september   a group of insurance underwriters for thuraya satellite telecommunications thuraya requested arbitration before the international chamber of commerce icc  against bssi 
the request for arbitration alleges that bssi breached its contract with thuraya for sale of a 
table of contents satellite which experienced anomalies with its concentrator solar arrays 
the claimants seek approximately million plus claims of interest  costs and fees consisting of insurance payments made to thuraya and further reserved the right to seek an additional million currently in dispute between thuraya and certain of its insurers 
thuraya has reserved its rights to seek uninsured losses that could increase the total amount disputed to million 
we believe that these claims lack merit and intend to vigorously defend against them 
in certain launch and satellite sales contracts  we include provisions for replacement launch services or hardware if we do not meet specified performance criteria 
we have historically purchased insurance to cover these exposures when allowed under the terms of the contract 
the current insurance market reflects unusually high premium rates and also suffers from a lack of capacity to handle all insurance requirements 
we make decisions on the procurement of insurance based on our analysis of risk 
there is one contractual launch currently scheduled for the second quarter of for which full insurance coverage has not been procured 
we estimate that the potential uninsured amount for that launch could range from million to million  depending on the nature of the uninsured event 
future combat systems on april  the us army announced that it plans to convert the future combat systems fcs program from an other transaction agreement ota to a standard dod contract 
an ota is contracted under a different congressional authority than a standard dod contract and generally imposes fewer administrative contractual requirements 
the current ota has been modified to incorporate clauses relating to the truth in negotiations act  cost accounting standards  and the procurement integrity act 
we signed a federal acquisition regulations based undefinitized contract authorization with the army on september and definitization is scheduled for march based on our assessment of the possible contractual changes  we do not believe there will be a significant impact to earnings  cash flow and or financial position 
future imagery architecture on september  we received a partial stop work order from the national reconnaissance office for the future imagery architecture fia program  which makes it probable that our scope of work will be reduced 
in the third quarter  revised cost and fee estimates were included in our financial statements to reflect our assessment of the probable outcome 
if the final cost and fee outcome is materially different than our current assessment  it could impact our financial performance 
the revenue loss was immaterial in this program is included in the network systems segment 
tanker program prior to the fourth quarter of  we incurred substantial pre contract costs for development of one in production aircraft for the tanker program 
these costs were being deferred based on our assessment that it was probable we would recover these costs when we were awarded the usaf tanker contract 
the pre contract costs were being deferred and recorded in inventory based on aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  which states that costs may be deferred if they can be associated with a specific anticipated contract  and if their recoverability from that contract is probable 
our assessment of probability was based on the fact that the dod appropriations act for fiscal year provided million funding for tanker replacement and the national defense authorization act for fiscal year provided authorization for the procurement of tanker aircraft and associated support contracts 
in addition  we believed  based on our understanding of the requirements  that our aircraft was the most cost effective solution that met those requirements and  therefore  that it was probable we would be awarded the usaf tanker contract 
based on prior dod contracting practices  we also believed it was probable that we would be awarded the initial support contracts 
on january   as a result of our year end review  we updated our assessment of the probability of securing the usaf tanker contract and announced our plan to recognize pre tax 
table of contents charges totaling million in our year end financial statements based on the continued delay of the contract award and the likely re competition of the contract 
commercial airplanes share was million and ids share was million 
within ids  a ws and support systems were impacted by the charge 
the charge included million of incurred design and development cost and million for anticipated supplier penalties 
through  the tanker program has orders for eight tankers  four from the italian air force and four from the japan self defense agency 
the first aircraft for italy will be tendered for acceptance in late and our first delivery to japan will occur in early work continues on the company sponsored research and development csr d effort as we entered the flight test phase of the program in and expect to complete it in the usaf is continuing to pursue a replacement for the kc tanker 
funding has been included in the dod appropriation act for both of its fiscal years and  and has also been included in the fiscal year dod budget request 
the usaf has announced that the replacement for the kc will be awarded through a competition which will be held in we remain firmly committed to the usaf tanker program and are ready to support our customer in whatever decision is made regarding the recapitalization of the nation s current aerial refueling fleet 
comanche on february  the us government announced plans to terminate for convenience tfc the rah comanche engineering and manufacturing development contract 
the joint venture between us and sikorsky aircraft  a division of united technologies corporation  had a share in program work and earnings 
on march  the us government issued a partial tfc notification 
a termination proposal was submitted to the us government on february  an updated proposal was submitted in january to reflect actual costs through we expect that a settlement will be reached by the end of the first quarter of the program represented less than of our revenues 
no material impact on our financial statements is expected 
integrated defense systems dollars in millions revenues of total company revenues operating earnings operating margins research and development contractual backlog unobligated backlog since our operating cycle is long term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules  the operating results of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of revenues and earnings  may not be indicative of future operating results 
in addition  depending on the customer and their funding sources  our orders might be structured as annual follow on contracts  or as one large multi year order or long term awards 
as a result  period to period comparisons of orders and backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context ids revenues remained stable in due to moderating defense budgets  up from  after strong growth of in over the operating earnings increase of million from to

research and development activities leverage our capabilities in architectures  system of systems integration and weapon systems technologies across a broad spectrum of capabilities designed to enhance situational awareness and survivability  increase mission effectiveness and interoperability  and improve affordability  reliability and economic ownership 
continued research and development investments in unmanned systems have enabled the demonstration of multi vehicle coordinated flight and distributed control of high performance unmanned combat air vehicles 
research and development in advanced weapons technologies emphasizes  among other things  precision guidance and multi mode targeting 
research and development investments in the global tanker transport aircraft program represent a significant opportunity to provide state of the art refueling capabilities to domestic and international customers

research and development the network systems research and development funding remains focused on the development of communications and command control capabilities that support a network centric architecture approach for our various government customers 
we are investing in the communications market to enable connectivity between existing air ground platforms  increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems  and leverage innovative communications concepts 
key programs in this area include joint tactical radio system  global positioning system  and transformational communications system 
investments were also made to support various intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance business opportunities including mma  aew c aircraft  and concepts that will lead to the development of next generation space intelligence systems 
a major contributor to our support of these dod transformation programs is the investment in the boeing integration center bic and extended network of modeling  simulation and analysis capabilities where our network centric operations concepts are developed in partnership with our customers 
significant upgrades were made in to the virtual warfare center in st louis and several other smaller facilities 
along with increased funding to support these areas of architecture and network centric capabilities development  we also maintained our investment levels in global missile defense and advanced missile defense concepts and technologies

launch orbital systems dollars in millions revenues of total company revenues operating earnings operating margins research and development contractual backlog unobligated backlog revenues l os revenues decreased from to primarily due to launch slips caused by the strike by the iam and the rocketdyne divestiture in and a favorable tfc settlement on a commercial satellite program in this was partially offset by higher contract values for delta iv launch contracts in revenues remained stable from to primarily due to the favorable tfc settlement in mentioned above offset by lower satellite and launch deliveries and milestone completions in compared to deliveries of production units were as follows delta ii delta iv commercial civil satellites 
table of contents operating earnings the l os operating earnings improvement from to was driven by the net gains on the sale of rocketdyne million  million of which was recognized at the other segment and edd million  gain from the sale of a parcel of land at our seal beach  california facility  and higher contract values for delta iv launch contracts in the operating losses recorded in were caused by performance issues in the satellite business due to cost growth from technical and quality issues and write offs of slow moving satellite inventory and also by cost growth on our delta iv program  partially offset by the favorable tfc settlement mentioned above 
the earnings improvement from to was primarily driven by two significant events in first  a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded in the first quarter of as a result of an internal reorganization whereby the sfas no 
reportable segments  operating segments  and reporting unit designations changed  causing significantly different relationships between reporting unit carrying values and fair values 
specifically  the new l os reporting unit was created by combining six pre existing reporting units 
the carrying value of one of these reporting units  boeing satellite systems  exceeded its fair value resulting in the goodwill balances at this reporting unit being fully impaired during however  the carrying values of the other five reporting units were less than their fair values  so the goodwill balances at these reporting units were not impaired during in addition  the board of directors in early approved our long range business plan which included downward revisions to cash flow projections for the l os reporting unit 
the combination of these factors resulted in the newly created l os reporting unit having a carrying value that exceeded its fair value  prompting recognition of the goodwill impairment charge 
in addition  earnings were further impacted by a second quarter charge of  million  of which million was attributable to the delta iv program caused by a combination of factors 
the most significant driver was the requirement to spread fixed costs of the delta iv program over a reduced number of anticipated launches as a result of continued weakness in the commercial space launch market  resulting in an earnings impact of million 
secondly  the program experienced cost growth of million primarily related to payload integration and launch support costs 
in each of these cases  the additional costs were not billable under the respective contracts 
in addition  the remaining million of the charge resulted from our determination that it was no longer probable that our us government customer would agree to price increases for change orders in connection with existing contracted and awarded delta iv launches 
the remaining million of the charge related to boeing satellite systems incurring additional costs as a result of satellite program complexities 
these complexities caused technical and quality issues resulting in schedule delays  cost impacts  and late delivery penalties which were not billable under the respective contract 
the results also include the adjustments made to equity investments in ellipso  skybridge and teledesic resulting in a net write down of million

it is expected that ula will reduce the cost of meeting the critical national security and nasa expendable launch vehicle needs of the united states 
the closing of the ula transaction is subject to certain closing conditions including government and regulatory approval in the united states and internationally 
on august   boeing and lockheed received clearance regarding the formation of ula from the european commission 
on october   the federal trade commission ftc requested additional information from us and lockheed related to ula in response to the pre merger notice under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of hsr submitted by the parties 
the ftc s second request extends the period that the ftc is permitted to review the transaction under the hsr act 
upon completion of the transaction  ula would be reported as an equity method investment 
we do not expect this agreement to have a material impact to our earnings  cash flows and or financial position for if the conditions to closing are not satisfied and the ula transaction is not consummated by march   either we or lockheed martin may terminate the joint venture agreement 
research and development the l os research and development investment is currently focused on the development of key technologies and systems solutions to support our nasa customer in the development of new space exploration systems

boeing capital corporation business environment and trends in the commercial aircraft market  bcc provides selective financing solutions to our commercial airplanes segment customers 
in the space and defense markets  bcc primarily structures financing solutions for our ids segment customers 
bcc s customer financing and investment portfolio at december  totaled billion  which was substantially all our commercial aircraft 
while worldwide traffic levels are well above traffic levels carried by the airlines in the recent past  the effects of higher fuel prices on the airline industry continue to impact commercial aircraft values 
recently published sources and market transactions indicate that passenger load factors are at record high levels  the supply of economically viable used aircraft is limited and  lease rates for aircraft are increasing 
however  despite these positive environmental factors  values for the various aircraft types serving as collateral in bcc s portfolio generally have not increased 
aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft  particularly types with relatively few operators  are placed out of service 
at the same time  the credit ratings of many airlines  particularly in the united states  have remained at low levels 
aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service 
approximately  commercial jet aircraft of current world fleet continue to be parked  including both in production and out of production aircraft types of which over are not expected to return to service 
at december   billion of bcc s portfolio was collateralized by aircraft 
during  bcc and the other segment provided million and million in valuation reserves due to a decrease in the collateral value of the aircraft 
should the aircraft suffer an additional decline in value  such impacts could result in a potential material adverse effect on the other segment s earnings  cash flows and or financial position

significant customer contingencies a substantial portion of bcc s portfolio is concentrated among us commercial airline customers 
certain customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or requested lease or loan restructurings  these negotiations were in various stages as of december  bcc does not expect that the current bankruptcies or reorganizations of ata holdings corp ata  viacao aerea rio grandense varig  delta or northwest including a return of some or all of the aircraft financed will have a material adverse effect on our earnings  cash flows and or financial position 
united airlines  inc at december  and  united airlines  inc 
united accounted for billion of bcc s total portfolio

at december   the ata portfolio consisted of six operating leases for aircraft and a note receivable 
on october   ata filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
as a result  on december   bcc entered into an agreement in principle with ata whereby ata agreed to continue to lease aircraft under restructured terms and agreed to return eight of the aircraft during the second half of and early ata is obligated to pay rent on all aircraft until returned 
bcc concurrently entered into an agreement with continental airlines continental to lease each of these eight aircraft as they are returned by ata 
in february  following completion of certain conditions  bcc reclassified the aircraft from finance leases to operating leases 
on july   the bankruptcy court approved the assumption of of the restructured aircraft leases by mutual agreement between bcc and ata  one aircraft lease was rejected and the aircraft returned to accommodate bcc s timely re leasing of the aircraft to continental 
the bankruptcy court order also approved a settlement agreement setting forth bcc s deficiency claim for the four aircraft to be retained by ata and a process for determining the amount of our deficiency claims for the remaining eight aircraft that will be returned to bcc

other segment other segment operating losses were million during as compared to losses of million during major factors contributing to results for the other segment are described below 
during and  we delivered a total of five aircraft to a joint venture named trm aircraft leasing co 
ltd 
trm 
such arrangement was accounted for as an operating lease due to additional financing and expense sharing arrangements with trm 
as a result  as of december   we deferred lease income of million 
during april  we terminated our ongoing obligations to trm and also received full payment from trm for the financing arrangement and recognized the remaining deferred lease income of million and repayment for the financing arrangement of million as revenue and charged the remaining net asset value to cost of services 
this transaction resulted in earnings before income taxes of million in our consolidated statements of operations in see note in  we recorded provisions for customer financing losses of million  which consisted of losses of million and million  due to the decrease in the collateral values of the and  respectively 
in  such provisions were million due to deteriorated airline credit ratings and depressed aircraft values 
additionally  charges of million were recognized in related to the decline in lease rates on certain aircraft 
in  we sold real property and equipment which resulted in a pretax gain of million reported in the other segment 
during  we recorded depreciation of million related to a demolished building and incurred an additional million pretax loss related to accounting for various real property transactions 
in  our research and development costs recorded at boeing technology decreased by approximately million primarily due to cost reduction strategies implemented across the business units during the year 
critical accounting policies and standards issued and not yet implemented contract accounting contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract  which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages 
for each contract  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized 
due to the size  length of time and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities  modified by our assumptions regarding 
table of contents contract options  change orders  incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance  and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or index based clauses 
the majority of these contracts are with the us government 
generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit 
the federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price 
total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends  technical and schedule risk  internal and subcontractor performance trends  business volume assumptions  asset utilization  and anticipated labor agreements 
the development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts 
estimates of each significant contract s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions  or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  supplier performance  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
during all of  ids s gross margin performance fell within the historical range of plus or minus change to gross margin 
if the combined gross margin for all contracts in ids for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased income for the year by approximately million 
program accounting program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity 
a program consists of the estimated number of units accounting quantity of a product to be produced in a continuing  long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
for each program  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer 
factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity  sales price  labor and employee benefit costs  material costs  procured parts  major component costs  overhead costs  program tooling costs  and routine warranty costs 
underlying all estimates used for program accounting is the forecasted market and corresponding production rates 
estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program  such as firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers  and market studies 
total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity  added together with the sales for all undelivered units under contract 
the sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates  consistent with typical sales contract terms 
cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers  historical performance trends  and business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include production rates  internal and subcontractor performance trends  asset utilization  anticipated labor agreements  and inflationary trends 
to ensure reliability in our estimates  we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes in estimates are recognized on a prospective basis 

table of contents due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions  or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
our recent experience has been that estimated changes due to accounting quantity  model mix  escalation  and cost performance adjustments have resulted in changes over the course of a year to the combined cost of sales percentages of all commercial airplane programs within a range of plus or minus 
if combined cost of sales percentages for all commercial airplane programs for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased income for by approximately million 
aircraft valuation used aircraft under trade in commitments the fair value of trade in aircraft is determined using aircraft specific data such as  model  age and condition  market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models  and multiple valuation sources 
this process uses our assessment of the market for each trade in aircraft  which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft 
there are several possible markets to which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft 
these markets include  but are not limited to  the resale market  which could potentially include the cost of long term storage  the leasing market  with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customer s requirements  or the scrap market 
collateral valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft 
on a quarterly basis  we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market 
this quarterly collateral valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft 
based on the best market information available at the time  it is probable that we would be obligated to perform on trade in commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling million and million at december  and accounts payable and other liabilities included million and million at december  and  which represents the exposure related to these trade in commitments 
had the estimate of trade in value used to calculate our obligation related to probable trade in commitments been higher or lower than our actual assessment  using a measurement date of december   accounts payable and other liabilities would have decreased or increased by approximately million 
we continually update our assessment of the likelihood of our trade in aircraft purchase commitments and continue to monitor all these commitments for adverse developments 
impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re lease when events or circumstances indicate and no less than annually  we review the carrying value of all aircraft and equipment under operating lease and held for sale or re lease for potential impairment 
we evaluate assets under operating lease or held for re lease for impairment when the expected undiscounted cash flow over the remaining useful life is less than the carrying value 
we use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow 
a key assumption is the expected future lease rates 
we also include assumptions about lease terms  end of economic life value of the aircraft or equipment  periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow on lease  maintenance costs  remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset and estimated proceeds from future asset sales 
we state assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 

table of contents when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset  the amount of asset impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
had future lease rates on these assets been lower  we estimate that the asset impairment expense would have increased by approximately million during we are unable to predict the magnitude or likelihood of any future impairments 
used aircraft acquired by the commercial airplanes segment are included in inventories at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets 
to mitigate costs and enhance marketability  aircraft may be placed on operating lease 
while on operating lease  the assets are included in customer financing  however  the valuation continues to be based on the lower of cost or market 
the lower of cost or market assessment is performed quarterly using the process described in the used aircraft under trade in commitments section 
allowance for losses on receivables the allowance for losses on receivables valuation provision is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the consolidated statements of financial position 
the balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio 
the estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors  including historical loss experience  collateral values  results of individual credit reviews and the general state of the economy and airline industry 
factors considered in assessing collectibility include  but are not limited to  a customer s extended delinquency  requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy 
the adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables 
we review the adequacy of the allowance by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate ie the credit adjusted collateral exposure 
we determine the collateral value by calculating the median values obtained from third party equipment appraisers industry data 
the applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term 
credit ratings are determined for each customer in the portfolio 
those ratings are updated based on public information and information obtained directly from our customers 
in recognition of the uncertainty of the ultimate loss experience and relatively long duration of the portfolio  a range of reasonably possible outcomes of the portfolio s credit adjusted collateral exposure is calculated by varying the applicable default rate by approximately plus or minus 
the resulting range of the allowance necessary to cover credit adjusted collateral exposure as of december   was approximately million to million 
lease residual values equipment under operating leases is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight line method over the lease term or projected economic life of the asset 
at december   the projected residual value of total equipment under operating leases was billion 
estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases 
for example  a change in the estimated residual values of could result in a cumulative pre tax earnings impact of million as of december   to be recognized over the remaining term of the lease portfolio 

table of contents goodwill impairment due to various acquisitions  goodwill has historically constituted a significant portion of our long term assets 
we perform our goodwill impairment test annually  on april  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions  and are subject to review and approval by our senior management and board of directors 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
therefore  changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded 
at the date of our previous impairment test  a increase or decrease in the value of our common stock would have had no impact on the financial statements 
postretirement plans the liabilities and net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of asset return  and medical trend rate of growth for medical costs 
we use a discount rate that is based on a point in time estimate as of our september annual measurement date 
this rate is determined based on a review of long term  high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date and use of models that match projected benefit payments of our major us pension and other postretirement plans to coupons and maturities from high quality bonds 
see note in the following table  we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change in the discount rate 
as of september  in millions change in discount rate increase bps change in discount rate decrease bps pension plans dollars dollars projected benefit obligation pensions net periodic pension cost other postretirement benefit plans accumulated postretirement benefit obligation net periodic postretirement benefit cost net periodic pension costs include an underlying expected long term rate of return on pension fund assets 
this expected return on assets assumption is derived from an extensive study conducted by our trust investments group and its actuaries on a periodic basis 
the study includes a review of 
table of contents actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes with consideration given to the related investment strategy 
while the study gives appropriate consideration to recent trust performance and historical returns  the assumption represents a long term prospective return 
the expected return on plan assets determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the net periodic benefit income cost for the upcoming plan year 
pension income or expense is sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of asset return 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased pension income by approximately million 
net periodic pension cost also includes an amortization of unrecognized gains and losses and changes in liabilities due to plan amendments 
the amount of unrecognized gains and losses can be significant and can significantly increase or decrease future net periodic pension cost 
the funded status of pension plans is sensitive to the discount rate and actual returns on assets 
changes in the funded status may have significant immediate impacts on our consolidated statements of financial position as of a new measurement date 
at present  our consolidated statements of financial position includes a prepaid pension asset  which primarily represents losses that have not yet been recognized 
in the normal course of events  the loss will be recognized over a period of years and the prepaid pension asset will be correspondingly reduced 
however  under certain economic conditions  we could be required to recognize all or a substantial portion of the recognized loss in a single accounting period 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires recognition of a minimum liability equal to the excess if any of a pension plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo over its assets 
the abo is the actuarial present value of the plan s obligation for benefits earned to date but without credit for expected future salary increases 
when a plan has an unfunded abo  or required minimum liability  it is also required to recognize any prepaid pension asset if any in excess of unrecognized prior service cost 
because the company s prepaid pension asset is significant  it is possible that under certain circumstances such as poor actual return on pension assets or low discount rate  several or all of our pension plans could become underfunded and we would have to recognize an additional liability equal to the amount underfunded plus the prepaid pension asset 
such a recognition could result in a significant reduction of our equity in the form of a reduction in other comprehensive income 
although gaap expense and pension contributions are not directly related  the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash that we would contribute to the pension plans 
potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law erisa and discretionary contributions made to improve the plans funded status 
net periodic costs for other postretirement plans include an assumption of the medical cost trend 
to determine the medical trend we look at a combination of information including our future expected medical costs  recent medical costs over the past five years  and general expectations in the industry 
the assumed medical cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans 
in the following table  we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change in the discount rate 
as of september  in millions change in medical trend rate increase bps change in medical trend rate decrease bps other postretirement benefit plans accumulated postretirement benefit obligation net periodic postretirement benefit cost 
table of contents standards issued and not yet implemented in september  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on issue no

eitf provides guidance as to when a general partner  or the general partners as a group  control a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
eitf is effective as of june  for general partners of all new limited partnerships formed and for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are modified 
eitf is effective as of january  for all other limited partnerships 
our adoption of the provisions of eitf will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
this standard requires that certain abnormal costs be recognized as current period charges rather than as a portion of the inventory cost  and that fixed production overhead costs be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facility 
the provisions of this standard apply prospectively and are effective for inventory costs incurred after january  while we believe this standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements  the impact of adopting these new rules is dependent on events that could occur in future periods  and cannot be determined until the event occurs in future periods 
contingent items various legal proceedings  claims and investigations related to products  contracts and other matters are pending against us 
most significant legal proceedings are related to matters covered by our insurance 
major contingencies are discussed below 
government investigations we are subject to various us government investigations  including those related to procurement activities and the alleged possession and misuse of third party proprietary data  from which civil  criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted 
such proceedings involve  or could involve claims by the government for fines  penalties  compensatory and treble damages  restitution and or forfeitures 
under government regulations  a company  or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions  can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts  or lose its export privileges  based on the results of investigations 
we believe  based upon current information  that the outcome of these disputes and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  except as set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements 
other contingencies we are also a defendant in suits filed by lockheed  ico global communications  ltd 
and several of our employees 
see note 
table of contents we are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment  including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites discussed 
such requirements have resulted in our being involved in legal proceedings  claims and remediation obligations since the s 
we routinely assess  based on in depth studies  expert analyses and legal reviews  our contingencies  obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites  including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a settlement and of recoveries from insurance carriers 
our policy is to immediately accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites based on our best estimate within a range of potential exposure for investigation  cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred 
the costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connection with such activities have not had  and are not expected to have  a material adverse effect on us 
with respect to results of operations  related charges have averaged less than of historical annual revenues 
although not considered likely  should we be required to incur remediation charges at the high level of the range of potential exposure  the additional charges would be less than of historical annual revenues 
because of the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified contaminated sites and circumstances  the potential exists for environmental remediation costs to be materially different from the estimated costs accrued for identified contaminated sites 
however  based on all known facts and expert analyses  we believe it is not reasonably likely that identified environmental contingencies will result in additional costs that would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or to our operating results and cash flow trends 
we have entered into standby letters of credit agreements and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts 
contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately billion as of december  and approximately billion at december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally investments  fixed rate debt obligations  and customer financing assets and liabilities 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to interest rate changes 
additionally  boeing capital corporation bcc uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
based on the current holdings of investments  as well as related swaps  the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material for these instruments 
the investors in the fixed rate debt obligations that we issue  do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity 
therefore  exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt 
the principal source of bcc s market risk relates to interest rate changes 
this risk is managed by matching the profile of bcc s liabilities with the profile of assets 
in a state of perfect matching  assets would be funded by debt of an equivalent term and other attributes 
perfect matching is impractical and inefficient given the irregular and unexpected amortization of some assets compared to how capital markets function as a source of funding 
the ensuing exposure to mismatch risk is measured and managed with the use of interest rate derivatives 
we do not use interest rate derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 

table of contents every quarter bcc uses duration based measures and analysis to estimate the impact of changes in interest rates 
potential changes in the net fair value of assets  liabilities and derivatives are calculated based on the amount and timing of projected cash flows 
it is important to note that these measures and sensitivity analysis are estimates and tools that depend on the assumptions and parameters used in the related models 
these models must be complemented by the experience and judgment of management 
although the assets  liabilities and derivatives affected by a change in interest rates are not traded  based on an immediate  one time  basis point increase in market rates at december   bcc estimated that the tax adjusted net fair value of these items would have decreased by million compared to a decrease of million at december  foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business and operational financing activities 
foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   a unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have reduced our unrealized gains by million 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses  respectively  in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk relating principally to energy used in production 
we periodically use commodity derivatives  such as fixed price purchase commitments  to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes of commodities 
commodity price exposure related to unhedged contracts is not material
