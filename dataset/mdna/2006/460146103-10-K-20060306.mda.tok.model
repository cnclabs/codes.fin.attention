income taxes international paper uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred income taxes are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are revalued to reflect new tax rates in the periods rate changes are enacted 
international paper records its worldwide tax provision based on the respective tax rules and regulations for the jurisdictions in which it operates 
where the company believes that the deduction of an item is supportable for income tax purposes  the item is deducted in its income tax returns

these accruals are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in other liabilities 
changes to the reserves are only made when an identifiable event occurs that changes the probable outcome  such as a settlement with the relevant tax authority  the expiration of statutes of limitation for the subject tax year  a change in tax laws  or a recent court case that addresses the matter

table of contents asset retirement obligations in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  a liability and an asset are recorded equal to the present value of the estimated costs associated with the retirement of long lived assets where a legal or contractual obligation exists and the liability can be reasonably estimated

accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
refers to the fact that a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the obligation 
international paper adopted the provisions of this interpretation in the fourth quarter of with no material affect on its consolidated financial statements 
the company s principal conditional asset retirement obligations relate to the potential future closure or redesign of certain of its production facilities 
in connection with any such activity  it is possible that the company may be required to take steps to remove certain materials from the facilities  or to remediate in accordance with federal and state laws that govern the handling of certain hazardous or potentially hazardous materials 
applicable regulations and standards provide that the removal of certain materials would only be required if the facility were to be demolished or underwent major renovations 
at this time  any such obligations have an indeterminate settlement date  and the company believes that adequate information does not exist to apply an expected present value technique to estimate any such potential obligations 
accordingly  the company does not record a liability for such remediation until a decision is made that allows reasonable estimation of the timing of such remediation

exterior siding and roofing settlements three nationwide class action lawsuits against the company and masonite corp  a formerly wholly owned subsidiary of the company  relating to exterior siding and roofing products manufactured by masonite were settled in and masonite was sold to premdor inc in the liability for these settlements  as well as the corresponding insurance recoveries each as further described below  were retained by the company 
the first suit  entitled judy naef v 
masonite and international paper  was filed in december and settled on january  the hardboard settlement 
the plaintiffs alleged that hardboard siding manufactured by masonite failed prematurely  allowing moisture intrusion that in turn caused damage to the structure underneath the siding 
the class consisted of all us property owners having masonite hardboard siding installed on and incorporated into buildings between january   and january  for siding that was installed between january   and december   the deadline for filing claims expired january   and for siding installed between january   through january   claims must be made by january  the second suit  entitled cosby  et al 
v 
masonite corporation  et al  was filed in and settled on january  the omniwood settlement

the class consisted of all us property owners having omniwood siding installed on and incorporated into buildings from january   to january  claims relating to omniwood siding must be made by january  the third suit  entitled smith  et al v 
masonite corporation  et al  was filed in and settled on january  the woodruf settlement 
the plaintiffs alleged that woodruf roofing manufactured by masonite was defective and caused damage to the structure underneath the roofing 
the class consisted of all us property owners who had incorporated and installed woodruf roofing from january   to january  for roofing that was installed between january  
table of contents  and december   the deadline for filing claims expired january   and for roofing installed between january   and january   claims must be made by january  all of the settlements provide for monetary compensation to class members meeting the settlement requirements on a claims made basis  which requires a class member to individually submit proof of damage to  or caused by  masonite product  proof of square footage involved and proofs of various other matters 
all of the settlements also provide for payment of attorneys fees equaling in the case of the hardboard settlement and in the case of the omniwood and woodruf settlements of the settlement amounts paid to class members 
claims filing and evaluation for all of the settlements  once a claim is determined to be valid  the amount of the claim is determined by reference to a negotiated compensation formula designed to compensate the homeowner for product damage to the structure 
the compensation formula is based on the average cost per square foot for product replacement  including material and labor as calculated by industry standards  in the area in which the structure is located  adjusted for inflation  or the cost of appropriate refinishing as determined by industry standards in such area 
pursuant to the settlement agreements  these costs are determined by reference to mean s price data  as published by rs means company  and updated annually for inflation 
persons receiving compensation pursuant to this formula also agree to release the company and masonite from all other property damage claims relating to the product in question 
in connection with the products involved in the settlements described above  where there is damage  the process of degradation  once begun  continues until repairs are made 
the company estimates that approximately four million structures have installed products that are the subject of the hardboard settlement   structures have installed products that are the subject of the omniwood settlement and  structures have installed products that are the subject of the woodruf settlement 
masonite stopped selling the products involved in the hardboard settlement in may  the products involved in the woodruf settlement in may and the products involved in the omniwood settlement in september persons who are class members under the settlements who do not pursue remedies may have recourse to warranties  if any  in existence at the expiration of the respective terms established under the settlement agreements for making claims 
the warranty period generally extends for years following the installation of the product in question and  although the warranties vary from product to product  they generally provide for a payment of up to two times the purchase price 
claims payment data through december   net settlement payments totaled approximately billion million for the hardboard settlement  million for the omniwood settlement and million for the woodruf settlement  including million of non refundable attorneys advances

in addition  there was approximately million of costs associated with administrative and legal fees incurred but not paid prior to year end 
reserve for siding and roofing settlements at december   net reserves for the settlements discussed above totaled million  of which million is attributable to the hardboard settlement  million to the omniwood settlement and million to the woodruf settlement 
the following table presents an analysis of the net reserve activity related to the hardboard  omniwood and woodruf settlements for the years ended december   and in millions hard board omni wood woodruf total balance  december  payments insurance collections balance  december  payments insurance collections balance  december  payments reclassification balance  december  while  for tracking purposes  the company maintains three reserve accounts for each of the hardboard  omniwood and woodruf settlements  we evaluate the adequacy of the aggregate reserve due to their similar and related nature 
in making a determination as to adequacy of the aggregate reserve  we employ a third party consultant to conduct statistical studies of future costs utilizing recent claims experience data 
in  projections were prepared of the anticipated claims activity and payments through the end of the claims period for each of the settlements 
these projections are updated annually using recent claims activity and other factors typically considered in projecting future claims 
table of contents and costs 
if the projections were to indicate that aggregate payments though the end of the claims period would be materially over or under the aggregate forecasted payments  the aggregate reserve would be appropriately adjusted 
since  our actual claims experience has been in line with projected forecasts and therefore there have been no adjustments of the aggregate reserve balance for these settlements 
a number of factors could cause actual results to vary from our projections  including a higher than projected cost per claim due to higher construction  wood  energy and replacement costs  all of which affect the inflation factor for the means price data discussed above  and increased claims from geographic locations where previously there had been few or no claims 
in january  the company received over  hardboard claims compared to  claims received in december  and  claims received in january 
this significant increase in claim volume coincided with the january  deadline for filing claims in the hardboard settlement for siding installed in the s 
claims are processed by the independent claims administrator and only those claims which meet the requirements of the hardboard settlement are paid 
following the january deadline  the independent claims administrator could not immediately determine how many of the  claims would meet the requirements for payment as set forth in the hardboard settlement 
in addition to this significant volume increase  the company experienced a higher average cost per claim due  in part  to a increase in the means price data compared to prior years 
at the end of the third quarter  the company s third party consultant advised the company that payments relating to s hardboard siding would be largely concluded by the end of the third quarter payments through the end of the third quarter totaled million  which were approximately million more than projected for the year 
however  during the fourth quarter  the number of valid s hardboard claims and approved payments exceeded the third party consultant s projection by million 
as a result of these unforeseen factors  the company made aggregate payments of million in for hardboard settlement claims 
despite the higher than anticipated number of valid s hardboard claims and the slightly higher cost per claim  the company believes that  as of the end of  the aggregate reserve balance for the hardboard  omniwood and woodruf settlements is adequate 
however  if new claims filed for products involved in these settlements  or the average cost per claim  were to be higher than projected in  the company might increase its aggregate reserve to cover claims for these settlements

note derivatives and hedging activities international paper periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate  commodity and currency risks 
for hedges that meet the criteria under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  international paper  at inception  formally designates and documents the instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction 
because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged 
derivatives are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value  determined using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies  in other current or noncurrent assets or liabilities 
the earnings impact resulting from the change in fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations as the underlying exposure being hedged 
the financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures 
the ineffective portion of a financial instrument s change in fair value  if any  would be recognized currently in earnings together with the changes in fair value of any derivatives not designated as hedges 
interest rate risk interest rate swaps may be used to manage interest rate risks associated with international paper s debt 
some of these instruments qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 and others do not 
interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount at december   of approximately million and maturities ranging from one to years do not qualify as hedges under sfas no

commodity risk to minimize volatility in earnings due to large fluctuations in the price of commodities  international paper may use swap and option contracts to manage risks associated with market fluctuations in energy prices 
such cash flow hedges are accounted for by deferring the after tax quarterly change in fair value of the outstanding contracts in oci 
on the date a contract matures  the gain or loss is reclassified into cost of products sold concurrent with the recognition of the commodity purchased

foreign currency risk international paper s policy has been to hedge certain investments in non us operations through borrowings denominated in the same currency as the operation s functional currency  or by entering into cross currency and interest rate swaps or foreign exchange contracts 
these financial instruments are effective as hedges against fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these instruments  which are offset in whole or in part by translation gains and losses on the non us operation s net assets hedged  are recorded as translation adjustments in oci 
upon liquidation or sale of the foreign investments  the accumulated gains or losses from the revaluation of the hedging instruments  together with the translation gains and losses on the net assets  are included in earnings

note retirement plans us defined benefit plans international paper maintains pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all domestic employees hired prior to july  these employees generally are eligible to participate in the plans upon completion of one year of service and attainment of age employees hired after june   who are not eligible for this pension plan receive an additional company contribution to their savings plan see other plans on page 
the plans provide defined benefits based on years of credited service and either final average earnings salaried employees  hourly job rates or specified benefit rates hourly and union employees 
international paper makes contributions that are sufficient to fully fund its actuarially determined costs  generally equal to the minimum amounts required by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
international paper made no contributions to the qualified defined benefit plan in or  and does not expect to make any contributions in unless international paper changes its funding policy to make contributions above the minimum requirements 
the us congress is currently considering various proposals that would change the minimum funding requirements for qualified defined benefit plans in future

the increases in and us pension expense were due to increases in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses  reductions in the discount rate and a reduction in in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  net of a reduction in in the assumed rate of future compensation increase 
international paper evaluates its actuarial assumptions annually as of december the measurement date and considers changes in these long term factors based upon market conditions and the requirements of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
these assumptions are used to calculate benefit obligations as of december of the current year  and pension expense to be recorded in the following year 
weighted average assumptions used to determine net pension expense for  and were as follows discount rate expected long term return on plan assets rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of december  and  were as follows discount rate rate of compensation increase the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the plan s investment portfolio 
projected rates of return are developed through an asset liability study in which projected returns for each of the plan s asset classes are determined after analyzing historical experience and future expectations of returns and volatility of the various asset classes 
based on the target asset allocation for each asset class  the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio is developed considering the effects of active portfolio management and expenses paid from plan assets 
the discount rate assumption is determined based on a yield curve that incorporates approximately aa graded bonds 
the plan s projected cash flows are then matched to the yield curve to develop the discount rate 
to calculate pension expense for  the company will use an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  a discount rate of and an assumed rate of compensation increase of 
the company estimates that it will record net pension expense of approximately million for its us defined benefit plans in  with the increase from expense of million in principally reflecting a change in the mortality assumption to use the retirement protection act table rp in versus the group annuity mortality table gam used in  an increase in the amortization of unrecognized actuarial losses over a shorter average remaining service period  and a decrease in the assumed discount rate to in from in

at this date  the market value of the plan assets was less than the accumulated benefit obligation abo for this plan 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 the prepaid asset was reversed and an additional minimum liability of billion was established equal to the shortfall of the market value of plan assets below the abo plus the prepaid benefit cost 
this resulted in an after tax direct charge to accumulated other comprehensive income oci of billion  with no impact on earnings  earnings per share or cash 
this reduction to shareholders equity had no adverse affect on international paper s debt covenants 
strong actual returns on plan assets in the fourth quarter of increased the market value of plan assets by more than the increase in the abo  resulting in a reduction in the required additional minimum pension liability 
as a result  a credit to after tax oci was recognized in the amount of million at december  at december   the change in the mortality assumption increased the abo by more than plan assets requiring an after tax charge to oci of million

stock option program international paper accounts for stock options using the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
under this method  compensation expense is recorded over the related service period when the market price exceeds the option price at the measurement date  which is the grant date for international paper s options 
no compensation expense is recorded as options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of international paper stock on the grant date 
during each reporting period  fully diluted earnings per share is calculated by assuming that in the money options are exercised and the exercise proceeds are used to repurchase shares in the marketplace 
when options are actually exercised  option proceeds are credited to equity and issued shares are included in the computation of earnings per common share  with no effect on reported earnings 
equity is also increased by the tax benefit that international paper will receive in its tax return for income reported by the optionees in their individual tax returns 
under the program  officers and certain other employees may be granted options to purchase international paper common stock 
the option price is the market price of the stock on the close of business on the day prior to the date of grant 
options must be vested before they can be exercised 
upon exercise of an option  a replacement option may be granted under certain circumstances with an exercise price equal to the market price at the time of exercise and with a term extending to the expiration date of the original option

as part of this shift in focus away from stock options to performance based restricted stock  the company accelerated the vesting of all million unvested stock options to july  the company also considered the benefit to employees and the income statement impact in making its decision to accelerate the vesting of these options 
based on the market value of the company s common stock on july   the exercise prices of all such stock options were above the market value and  accordingly  the company recorded no expense as a result of this action
