in june of  this product will be sunset by fcg and all revenue and cost will cease in july revenue from full contact during was approximately  sales and marketing we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from existing clients and client referrals 
we market our services primarily through our vice presidents and account managers 
our vice presidents and account managers seek to develop strong relationships with senior level information management and other decision making personnel at leading healthcare and pharmaceutical organizations 
we maintain these relationships by striving to successfully complete assignments and exceed clients expectations 
our vice presidents and practice directors allocate a significant portion of their time to business development and related activities 
we also employ account managers and functional sales specialists who are dedicated to business development with potential and existing clients 
we are frequently engaged to provide multiple services throughout several phases of a client s it system lifecycle and related business processes  including strategy  planning  procurement and contracting  implementation  integration  and operations management 
as a result of this involvement  our personnel often develop an in depth understanding of our clients business systems and capabilities and develop strong relationships with personnel within the client organization 
these relationships provide us with significant opportunities to undertake additional assignments for each client 
in addition to generating assignments from existing clients  we attract new clients through our targeted marketing activities 
our marketing activities include email and direct marketing  public presentations  press and analyst relations  publishing of books  articles and white papers  and trade show participation 
we also maintain research reports and white papers on our website  along with other company and industry information 
our marketing staff works on product and services positioning and strategy which is built into our sales support tools  including presentations  brochures  published articles  sales kits  descriptions of our services  and case studies 
industry research and knowledge sharing our services and consultants are supported by internal and external research  training  and a centralized information system that provides real time access to current industry and technology information and project methodologies  experiences  models  and tools 
our principal research and practice support initiatives include emerging practices group  professional development programs  and knowledge  information  technology exchange kite 
emerging practices group 
the emerging practices group performs industry research and collects  packages  and distributes knowledge regarding emerging trends in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries  their implications for the industry  and the need for technology support 
examples of topics that the emerging practices group has researched are cpoe  disease management  pay for performance  rhios  patient safety  e prescribing  it and business process outsourcing  and hand held technology 
we also provide customized research for product and market strategies  evaluate the commercial potential for new products  and conduct internal and client workshops 
the emerging practices group also participates in research projects and publishes a monthly news summary that is sent to several thousand subscribers

we provide training and development opportunities to our employees through web enabled training and education  computer based training  distance learning  and external seminars 
we educate all new employees about our history  culture  and practices

knowledge  information  technology exchange kite 
our employees have access to our internal research and to current industry and technology information and project methodologies  experiences  models  and tools through kite 
kite currently houses approximately  documents that include industry information  service methodologies and tools  benchmarks and best practice information  and other documentation to support our services and consultants 
kite is updated on a continuous basis with information resulting from each engagement  and by the emerging practices group 
we believe that this resource allows our employees to utilize engagement specific information that improves the quality and content of services delivered to clients while reducing cost of our delivery 
competition the market for healthcare outsourcing  consulting  implementation and integration  and research services is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving  and highly fragmented 
we have competitors that provide some or all of the same services that we provide 
we compete for consulting services with large international multi industry firms such as accenture  ibm global services  computer sciences corporation  and deloitte consulting  and regional and specialty consulting firms 
in implementation and integration services  we compete with information system vendors such as cerner  epic systems  eclipsys  and meditech  service groups of computer equipment companies and specialty consulting firms  and systems integration companies such as accenture  infosys  cognizant  and ibm global services 
in outsourcing we compete with large international companies such as perot systems corporation  affiliated computer services acs  and computer sciences 
we also compete with offshore service companies that provide software development  it consulting  and other integration and maintenance services  such as wipro technologies  infosys  cognizant technology solutions corporation  and tata technologies limited 
in recent years  our clients internal information management departments have become a competitor by internally performing more it related services 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  human  and marketing resources than us 
as a result  such competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale  and support of their products and services than us 
in addition  as healthcare organizations become larger and more complex  our larger competitors may be better able to serve the needs of such organizations 
we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel or dedicate the financial resources necessary to serve these resulting organizations 
we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our healthcare and life sciences domain expertise and experience  our reputation  quality of our services  and our effective use of an onsite  offsite  and offshore business model to perform services for our clients that are becoming increasingly price sensitive 
large it companies have  in the past  offered consulting services at a substantial discount as an incentive to utilize their implementation services 
likewise  software and hardware vendors may provide discounted implementation services for their products 
in the future  these competitors may discount such services more frequently or offer such services at no charge 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete for price sensitive clients on the basis of our current pricing or cost structure  or that we will be able to continue to lower our prices or costs in order to compete effectively 
many of our competitors are also creating offshore delivery services that may significantly reduce their rates charged to clients 
furthermore  many of our competitors have long standing business relationships with key personnel at healthcare organizations  which could prevent or delay us from expanding our client base 
we believe that we have been able to compete successfully on the basis of the quality and range of our services  and the accumulated expertise of our consultants 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete with our current and future competitors 
further  competitive pressures may cause our revenues or operating margins to decline or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
limited protection of proprietary information and procedures our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to protect our proprietary information  including our proprietary methodologies  research  tools  software code  and other information 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights 
we request that our consultants and employees sign confidentiality agreements and generally limit access to and distribution of our research  methodologies and software codes 
the steps we take to protect our proprietary information may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation 
in addition  the laws of certain countries do not protect or enforce proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we believe that our systems and procedures and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties could assert infringement claims against us in the future  and such claims may result in protracted and costly litigation  regardless of the merits of such claims 
employees as of december   we had  employees  of whom were vice presidents with responsibility for service delivery  new business development  client relationships  staff development  and company leadership 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
we use a variety of techniques to identify and recruit qualified candidates to support our growth including full time recruiters  an internal employee referral program  advertisements  and professional search firms 
vendor relationships we have established numerous vendor relationships 
we believe the formation of these relationships enables us to increase our knowledge of key vendor solutions  obtain appropriate training  education  and certification on key technologies and solutions  and gain advantages from joint marketing approaches where appropriate 
in turn  we are able to more rapidly identify and deliver integrated solutions to our clients  based on leading technologies  applications  and solutions 
we have established non exclusive alliance agreements with software  hardware  and service vendors that market components and solutions to our current and prospective clients 
the vendor alliance agreements of which we are a part have provided us with sales leads  marketing assistance revenues  increased publicity  discounted software  specialized training programs  participation in beta software programs  and privileged information about vendors technical and marketing strategies

risk factors risks relating to our business before deciding to invest in us or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations 
if any of these risks are realized  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
many factors may cause our net revenues  operating results  and cash flows to fluctuate and possibly decline 
our net revenues  operating results  and cash flows may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these factors may include our ability to achieve and maintain profitability in each of our business segments  the loss of one or more significant clients in any of our business segments  including any failure to secure renewals for any of our large outsourcing contracts or any early termination of any significant contracts  our ability to recruit and retain a new chief executive officer  and the ability of our current management team to effectively manage our operations through a transition in management  our ability to realize our deferred tax assets through future pretax earnings  use of offsite and offshore resources on our engagements and adoption of a blended shore delivery model in the healthcare it industry  our ability to leverage and continue to manage through cost reductions made in the fourth quarter of  including reductions in the number of our vice presidents and reductions in our sales force as part of a change in our selling approach in health delivery  the roll off or completion of significant projects in any of our business segments  fluctuations in market demand for our services which affect associate hiring and utilization  delays or increased expenses in securing and completing client engagements  timing and collection of fees and payments  the financial performance and credit worthiness of our clients  timing of new client engagements in any of our business segments  increased competition and pricing pressures  budgeting and other capital expenditure decisions of our clients  our ability to anticipate changing customer demands and preferences  our ability to incorporate the use of variable labor staffing into our projects  the loss of key personnel and other employees  changes in our  and our competitors  business strategy  pricing  and billing policies  the timing of certain general and administrative expenses  costs associated with integrating acquired operations  costs associated with the disposition of certain assets  impairment of goodwill from our acquisitions  variability in the number of billable days in each quarter  the write off of client billings  return of fees for work deemed unsatisfactory by a client or claims or litigation resulting from the same  service level credits and penalties associated with our outsourcing engagements  entry into fixed price engagements and engagements where some fees are contingent upon the client realizing a certain return on investment for a project  availability of foreign net operating losses and other credits against our earnings  impact on our business and clients relating to force majeure events  including recent hurricanes in the southeast and potential pandemic or epidemic disease  international currency fluctuations  expenses related to the issuance of stock options to our employees  and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of our expenses  particularly personnel and related costs  depreciation  office rent  and occupancy costs 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be unexpectedly high or result in a decrease in our revenues during any given period 
in addition  we bill certain of our services on a fixed price basis  and any assignment delays or expenditures of time beyond that projected for the assignment could result in write offs of client receivables both unbilled and billed 
significant write offs could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our business also has significant collection risks 
if we are unable to collect our receivables in a timely manner  our business and financial condition could also suffer 
if these or any other variables or unknowns were to cause a shortfall in revenues or earnings or otherwise cause a failure to meet public market expectations  our business could be adversely affected 
finally  we reported a net loss for the year ended december  as a result  we cannot assure you that we will achieve or maintain positive earnings in the future 
if we are unable to achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis  the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected and our financial condition would suffer 
we are dependent on our outsourcing engagements for a significant part of our revenues 
net revenues from our outsourcing relationships  for the year ended december   represented approximately of our consolidated net revenues 
the substantial majority of these revenues are received from five large outsourcing accounts that signed long term agreements with us 
in june  we received a termination for convenience notice from the new york and presbyterian hospital  our largest client  and our outsourcing engagement with them terminated effective december  in addition  we entered into a mutual termination agreement with umass memorial health care on september  and all services under that agreement were completed as of december  we have recently received a one year extension of one of our existing major outsourcing contracts  university of pennsylvania health system uphs  and that contract is now set to expire in march during the current extension period  we intend to negotiate in good faith with uphs on pricing and service levels applicable to the one year extension  and until then  current pricing and service levels apply 
we currently have no assurances that the contract will be extended past the one year renewal period  and uphs still has the right to terminate the contract for convenience on days notice 
the loss of any of our remaining three large outsourcing relationships  including a failure to gain renewal of any of these contracts or a longer term renewal at uphs  could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
further  if we are unable to successfully close and implement the new outsourcing relationships that we are pursuing including the renewal of our existing outsourcing clients  both large and small  our business and results of operations will be adversely impacted 
we recognize revenue from certain service elements of our outsourcing agreements on a straight line basis over the life of the contract  rather than on a percentage of completion basis 
since we typically incur greater costs and expenses during the early phase of the service elements which now have straight line revenue recognition than we do in the later years of those elements  we believe our net income will be less during the early stages of our outsourcing engagements 
in addition  if we are unable to manage costs as planned in the later stages of an outsourcing engagement  our net income will likewise be negatively impacted 
in general  income from our outsourcing contracts will be less stable in the future  since it will be more susceptible to changes in the mix of newer versus older contracts  and to the impact of cost fluctuations from quarter to quarter without a compensating change in revenues 
if we fail to meet our public market expectations or otherwise experience a shortfall in our net income due to these fluctuations  our business could be adversely affected and the price of our stock may decline 
in many of our outsourcing engagements  the clients have fully outsourced their information technology staff and functions to us 
in all of our outsourcing relationships  we generally enter into detailed service level agreements  which establish performance levels and standards for our services 
if we fail to meet these performance levels or standards  our clients may receive monetary service level credits from us or  if we experience persistent failures  our clients may have a right to terminate the outsourcing contract for cause and have no obligation to pay us any termination fees 
our anticipated revenues and profitability from our outsourcing engagements could be significantly reduced if we are unable to satisfy our performance levels or standards  or if we are unable to improve our delivery costs as planned on such engagements 
additionally  our outsourcing contracts can be terminated at the convenience of our clients upon the payment of a termination fee 
in addition  many of our outsourcing agreements require that we invest significant amounts of time and resources in order to win the engagement  transition the client s information technology department to our management  and complete the initial transformation of our client s information technology functioning to provide improved service at a lower cost and meet agreed upon service levels 
often  we recover this investment through payments over the life of the outsourcing agreement 
if we are unable to achieve agreed upon service levels or otherwise breach the terms of our outsourcing agreements  the clients may have rights to terminate our agreements for cause and we may be unable to recover our investments 
in addition  our pricing for many of these agreements generally assume that we can reduce and manage costs so as to achieve desired margins and recoup our investments 
any failure by us to effectively reduce and manage costs and or recover these investments could reduce our outsourcing revenues  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  and price of our common stock 
our outsourcing engagements may also require that we hire part or all of a client s information technology personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain these individuals  and effectively hire additional personnel as needed to meet the obligations of our contract 
any failure by us to retain these individuals or otherwise satisfy our contractual obligations could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our outsourcing business and our reputation as an information technology services outsourcing provider 
finally  we continue to pursue the outsourcing of discrete information technology services for clients 
the amount of time and resources required to win client engagements for our outsourcing business is significant  and we may not win the number or type of client engagements that we anticipate 
if we fail to meet our objective to secure new outsourcing engagements  or fail to secure new outsourcing engagements on acceptable commercial terms  we will not experience the growth in this business that we have anticipated 
we have experienced a material weakness in our internal controls 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and our management may not be able to provide its report on the effectiveness of our internal controls as required by the sarbanes oxley act of management and our independent registered public accounting firm have identified a material weakness regarding our internal control over financial reporting 
the public company accounting oversight board s auditing standard no 
defines a material weakness as a significant deficiency  or combination of significant deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
as a result of the material weakness  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that  as of december   the end of the period covered by this report  our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the securities exchange act of is recorded  processed  summarized and reported  within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms 
our material weakness relates to our internal control over our financial reporting 
the material weakness is described in detail in item a 
controls and procedures 
as a result  we are not able to conclude that our internal controls over financial accounting and reporting were effective as of december   which resulted in the inability of our external auditors to deliver an unqualified report on our internal controls 
inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities 
we have taken and continue to take steps to correct the material weakness 
the efficacy of the steps we have taken to date and the steps we are still in the process of taking to improve the reliability of our financial statements is subject to continued management review supported by confirmation and testing by our internal auditors  as well as audit committee oversight 
we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will not in the future identify further material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that we have not discovered to date 
the length of time required to engage a client and to complete an assignment may be unpredictable and could negatively impact our net revenues and operating results 
the timing of securing our client engagements and service fulfillment is difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy 
prior engagement cycles are not necessarily an indication of the timing of future client engagements or revenues 
the length of time required to secure a new client engagement or complete an assignment often depends on factors outside our control  including existing information systems at the client site  changes or the anticipation of changes in the regulatory environment affecting healthcare and pharmaceutical organizations  changes in the management or ownership of the client  budgetary cycles and constraints  changes in the anticipated scope of engagements  availability of personnel and other resources  and consolidation in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries 
prior to client engagements  we typically spend a substantial amount of time and resources identifying strategic or business issues facing the client  defining engagement objectives  gathering information  preparing proposals  and negotiating contracts 
our failure to procure an engagement after spending such time and resources could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may also be required to hire new associates before securing a client engagement 
if clients defer committing to new assignments for any length of time or for any reason we could be required to maintain a significant number of under utilized associates which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition during any given period 
further  our outsourcing business has very long sales and contract lead times  requiring us to spend a substantial amount of time and resources in attempting to secure each outsourcing engagement 
we cannot predict whether the investment of time and resources will result in a new outsourcing engagement or  if the engagement is secured  that the engagement will be on terms favorable to us 
we may be negatively impacted if our investments in products and emerging service lines are unsuccessful 
we have invested in product development  including firstdoc and firstgateways tm 
these investments are in addition to continuing our investments in other emerging service lines and products and to date  the investments have not generated significant returns 
as a result  our financial results may continue to be adversely impacted by product investment 
if such product development activities or investment in our emerging service lines do not result in relevant offerings and sales  we will not achieve desired levels of return on these investments 
as a result  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to generate additional revenue from our existing clients  our business may be negatively affected 
our success depends  to a significant extent  on obtaining additional engagements from our existing clients 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from additional services provided to our existing clients 
the loss of a small number of clients  a reduction in the number of engagements with these clients  or the failure to secure renewals from any of our outsourcing clients may result in a material decline in revenues and cause us to fail to meet public market expectations of our financial performance and operating results 
if we fail to generate additional revenues from our existing clients  it may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if we fail to meet client expectations in the performance of our services  our business could suffer 
our services often involve assessing and or implementing complex information systems and software  which are critical to our clients operations 
our failure to meet client expectations in the performance of our services  including the quality  cost  and timeliness of our services  may damage our reputation in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain clients 
if a client is not satisfied with our services  we will generally spend additional human and other resources at our own expense to ensure client satisfaction 
such expenditures will typically result in a lower margin on such engagements and could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
further  in the course of providing our services  we will often recommend the use of software and hardware products 
these products may not perform as expected or contain defects 
if this occurs  our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to liability 
we attempt contractually to limit our exposure to potential liability claims  however  such limitations may not be effective 
a successful liability claim brought against us may adversely affect our reputation in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
although we maintain professional liability insurance  such insurance may not provide adequate coverage for successful claims against us 
our international operations create specialized risks that can negatively affect us 
we are subject to many risks as a result of the services we provide to our international clients or services we may provide through subcontractors or employees that are located outside of the us we have business operations and employees located in india  vietnam  and throughout europe 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including increasing and uncertain labor costs and high turnover rates  difficulties in creating market demand for our offshore services based on perceived quality issues and potential political risk  difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights  difficulties in creating international market demand for our other services  unfavorable pricing and price competition  difficulties and costs of tailoring our services to each individual country s healthcare and pharmaceutical market needs  currency fluctuations  recruiting and hiring employees  and other employment issues unique to international operations  including ability to secure work visas for foreign employees in the us  changes in availability of  and requirements for  the types of work visas we may seek for our foreign employees working in the us  restrictions on travel or other work conditions imposed by foreign governments  additional costs  including income tax equalization  associated with foreign employees coming to work in the us  longer payment cycles in some countries and difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable  terrorist attacks or armed hostilities  adverse tax consequences  increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts and offices  government regulations and restrictions  adverse changes in regulatory requirements  and economic or political instability 
we perform services in europe for our international pharmaceutical clients 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to be profitable in our european operations  which may materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and price for our common stock 
our acquisition of paragon solutions  inc now fcg software services in provided us a means to implement our global sourcing strategy to provide software development and other information technology services to our clients 
if we are unable to realize perceived cost benefits of such a strategy or if we are unable to receive high quality services from foreign employees or subcontractors  our business may be adversely impacted 
further  our international operations in vietnam and india subject our business to a variety of risks and uncertainties unique to operating businesses in these countries  including the risk factors discussed above 
any one or all of these factors may cause increased operating costs  lower than anticipated financial performance  and may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
if we do not compete effectively in the healthcare and pharmaceutical information services industries  our business will be negatively impacted 
the market for healthcare and pharmaceutical information technology consulting is very competitive 
we have competitors that provide some or all of the services we provide 
for example  in strategic consulting services  we compete with international  regional  and specialty consulting firms such as bearing point formerly kpmg consulting  deloitte consulting  ibm global services  wipro technologies  and accenture 
in integration and co management services  we compete with information system vendors such as epic systems  eclipsys  meditech  cerner corporation  and general electric healthcare  service groups of computer equipment companies  systems integration companies such as affiliated computer services acs  electronic data systems corporation  perot systems corporation  infosys  cognizant technology solutions corporation  and computer sciences corporation  clients internal information management departments  other consulting firms such as accenture  and computer sciences corporation s consulting division  and other healthcare and pharmaceutical consulting and outsourcing firms 
in e health and e commerce related services  we compete with the traditional competitors outlined above  as well as newer internet product and service companies 
we also compete with companies that provide software development  information technology consulting and outsourcing  and other integration and maintenance services  such as wipro technologies  infosys  cognizant technology solutions corporation  and tata technologies limited 
several of our competitors employ a global sourcing strategy to provide software development and other information technology services to their clients  while at the same time reducing their cost structure and improving the quality of services they provide 
if we are unable to realize the perceived cost benefits of our recently implemented global sourcing strategy or if we are unable to receive high quality services from foreign employees or subcontractors  our business may be adversely impacted and we may not be able to compete effectively 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  human  and marketing resources than us 
as a result  such competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale  and support of their products and services than we do 
in addition  as healthcare organizations become larger and more complex  our larger competitors may be better able to serve the needs of such organizations 
if we do not compete effectively with current and future competitors  we may be unable to secure new and renewed client engagements  or we may be required to reduce our rates in order to compete effectively 
this could result in a reduction in our revenues  resulting in lower earnings or operating losses  and otherwise materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may be unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees 
our business is labor intensive and requires highly skilled employees 
many of our associates possess extensive expertise in the healthcare  insurance  pharmaceutical  information technology  and consulting fields 
to serve a growing client base  we must continue to recruit and retain qualified personnel with expertise in each of these areas 
we must also seek certain employees who are willing to work on a variable or per diem basis 
competition for such personnel is intense and we compete for such personnel with management consulting firms  healthcare and pharmaceutical organizations  software firms  and other businesses 
many of these entities have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do  or can offer more attractive compensation packages to candidates  including salary  bonuses  stock  and stock options 
if we are unable to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to serve existing and new clients  our ability to expand our client base or services and to offer our services at competitive rates could be impaired and our business would suffer 
the loss of our key client service employees and executive officers could negatively affect us 
our performance depends on the continued service of our executive officers  senior managers  and key employees 
in particular  we depend on such persons to secure new clients and engagements and to manage our business and affairs 
the loss of such persons could result in the disruption of our business  longer or delayed sales cycles  and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have not entered into long term employment contracts with any of our employees and do not maintain key employee life insurance 
on november   luther j 
nussbaum resigned from his position of chairman of the board  chief executive officer  and member of our board of directors 
steven heck  our president  has been named as interim chief executive officer  effective on the same date 
in addition  douglas g 
bergeron  a current independent member of the board of directors  has been named chairman of the board 
the board of directors has initiated a search for a new chief executive officer 
if we are unable to recruit and retain a new chief executive officer  or if our current management team is unable to effectively manage and maintain our business through the transition in management  our business could be adversely impacted 
continued or increased employee turnover could negatively affect our business 
we have experienced employee turnover as a result of dependence on lateral hiring of associates  travel demands imposed on our associates  loss of employees to competitors and clients  and reductions in force as certain areas of our business have seen less demand 
continued or increased employee turnover could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  many of our associates develop strong business relationships with our clients 
we depend on these relationships to generate additional assignments and engagements 
the loss of a substantial number of associates could erode our client base and decrease our revenues  and could adversely impact our ability to meet contractual obligations to clients 
if we are unable to manage shifts in market demand or growth in our business  our business may be negatively impacted 
our business has historically grown  and though our overall revenues have remained flat for the past several years  we have experienced growth in certain areas of our business 
in response to shifts in market demand and in an effort to better align our business with our markets  we restructured our organization and hired persons with appropriate skills  including salespersons  and reduced our workforce in practice areas experiencing less demand 
we have also hired employees willing to work on a variable or per diem basis in order to better manage project costs and general and administrative expenses associated with underutilized resources 
these market conditions and restructuring efforts have placed new and increased demands on our management personnel 
they have also placed significant and increasing demands on our financial  technical and operational resources  and on our information systems 
if we are unable to manage growth effectively or if we experience business disruptions due to shifts in market demand  or growth or restructuring  our operating results will suffer 
to manage any future growth  we must extend our financial reporting and information management systems to our multiple and international office locations and traveling employees  and develop and implement new procedures and controls to accommodate new operations  services  and clients 
increasing operational and administrative demands may make it difficult for our senior managers to engage in business development activities and their other day to day responsibilities 
further  the addition of new employees and offices to offset any increasing demands may impair our ability to maintain our service delivery standards and corporate culture 
in addition  we have in the past changed  and may in the future change  our organizational structure and business strategy 
such changes may result in operational inefficiencies and delays in delivering our services 
such changes could also cause a disruption in our business and could cause a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries or the economy in general could negatively impact our revenues 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from clients in the healthcare industry 
as a result  our business  financial condition  and results of operations are influenced by conditions affecting this industry  particularly any trends towards consolidation among healthcare and pharmaceutical organizations 
such consolidation may reduce the number of existing and potential clients for our services 
in addition  the resulting organizations could have greater bargaining power  which could erode the current pricing structure for our services and decrease our revenues 
the reduction in the size of our target market or our failure to maintain our pricing goals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
finally  each of the markets we serve is highly dependent upon the health of the overall economy 
our clients in each of these markets have experienced significant cost increases and pressures in recent years 
our services are targeted at relieving these cost pressures  however  any continuation or acceleration of current market conditions could greatly impact our ability to secure or retain engagements  the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
a portion of our revenues has also come from companies in the pharmaceutical industry 
our revenues are  in part  linked to the pharmaceutical industry s research and development and technology expenditures 
should any of the following events occur in the pharmaceutical industry  our business could be negatively affected in a material way continued adverse changes to the industry s general economic environment  continued consolidation of companies  or a decrease in pharmaceutical companies research and development or technology expenditures 
a trend in the pharmaceutical industry is for companies to outsource either large information technology dependent projects or their information systems staff 
we benefit when pharmaceutical companies outsource to us  but may lose significant future business when pharmaceutical companies outsource to our competitors 
if this outsourcing trend slows down or stops  or if pharmaceutical companies direct their business away from us  our financial condition and results of operations could be impacted in a materially adverse way 
we could be negatively impacted if we fail to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire 
we have grown  in part  by acquiring complementary businesses that could enhance our capability to serve the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries 
all acquisitions involve risks that could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
these risks include distracting management from our business  losing key personnel and other employees  losing clients  costs  delays  and inefficiencies associated with integrating acquired operations and personnel  the impairment of acquired assets and goodwill  acquiring the contingent and other liabilities of the businesses we acquire  and not realizing the intended or expected benefits of the acquisitions 
in addition  acquired businesses may not enhance our services  provide us with increased client opportunities  or result in the growth that we anticipate 
furthermore  integrating acquired operations is a complex  time consuming  and expensive process 
combining acquired operations with us may result in lower overall operating margins  greater stock price volatility  and quarterly earnings fluctuations 
cultural incompatibilities  career uncertainties  and other factors associated with such acquisitions may also result in the loss of employees and clients 
failing to acquire and successfully integrate complementary practices  or failing to achieve the business synergies or other anticipated benefits  could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
if we fail to establish and maintain relationships with vendors of software and hardware products  it could have a negative effect on our ability to secure engagements 
we have a number of relationships with software and hardware vendors 
for example  our life sciences business is highly dependent upon a non exclusive relationship with emc documentum  a vendor of document management software applications with which we integrate our firstdoc solution 
we often are engaged by vendors or their customers to implement or integrate vendor products based on our relationship with a particular vendor 
in addition  our clients may request that we host or operate a vendor application as part of a hosting or outsourcing relationship  which may require the consent or cooperation of the vendor 
as a result  we believe that our relationships with vendors are important to our operations  including our sales  marketing  and support activities 
if we fail to maintain our relationships with these vendors  or fail to establish additional new relationships  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our relationships with vendors of software and hardware products could have a negative impact on our ability to secure consulting engagements 
our growing number of relationships with software and hardware vendors could result in clients perceiving that we are not independent from those software and hardware vendors 
our ability to secure assessment and other consulting engagements is often dependent  in part  on our being independent of software and hardware solutions that we may review  analyze  or recommend to clients 
if clients believe that we are not independent of those software and hardware vendors  clients may not engage us for certain consulting engagements relating to those vendors  which could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our business 
we may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
our success depends  in part  on not infringing patents  copyrights  and other intellectual property rights held by others 
we do not know whether patents held or patent applications filed by third parties may force us to alter our methods of business and operation or require us to obtain licenses from third parties 
if we attempt to obtain such licenses  we do not know whether we will be granted licenses or whether the terms of those licenses will be fair or acceptable to us 
third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future 
such claims may result in protracted and costly litigation  penalties  judgments  and fines that could adversely affect our business regardless of the merits of such claims 
if we fail to keep pace with regulatory and technological changes  our business could be materially adversely affected 
the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries are subject to regulatory and technological changes that may affect the procurement practices and operations of healthcare and pharmaceutical organizations 
during the past several years  the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries have been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and reform proposals 
these reforms could increase governmental involvement in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries  lower reimbursement rates  or otherwise change the operating environment of our clients 
also  certain reforms that create potential work for us could be delayed or cancelled 
healthcare and pharmaceutical organizations may react to these situations by curtailing or deferring investments  including those for our services 
in addition  if we are unable to maintain our skill and expertise in light of regulatory or technological changes  our services may not be marketable to our clients and we could lose existing clients or future engagements 
finally  government regulations  particularly hipaa  may require our clients to impose additional contractual responsibilities on us  which may make it more costly to perform certain of our engagements and subject us to increased risk in the performance of these engagements  including immediate termination of an engagement 
technological change in the network and application markets has created high demand for consulting  implementation  and integration services 
if the pace of technological change were to diminish  we could experience a decrease in demand for our services 
any material decrease in demand would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we may be unable to effectively protect our proprietary information and procedures 
we must protect our proprietary information  including our proprietary methodologies  research  tools  software code  and other information 
to do this  we rely on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property 
these steps may not protect our proprietary information 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect or enforce proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we are currently providing our services to clients in international markets and have business operations in europe  india and vietnam 
our proprietary information may not be protected to the same extent as provided under the laws of the united states  if at all 
the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the price of our common stock may be adversely affected by market volatility 
the trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly 
since our common stock began trading publicly in february  the reported sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market has been as high as and as low as per share 
this price may be influenced by many factors  including our performance and prospects  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock  investor perception of us and the industries in which we operate  changes in earnings estimates or buy sell recommendations by analysts  general financial and other market conditions  domestic and international economic conditions  and the other risks related to our business discussed above 
in addition  public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionately impacted by the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as a result  we may be unable to raise capital or use our stock to acquire businesses on attractive terms and investors may be unable to resell their shares of our common stock at or above their purchase price 
further  if research analysts stop covering our company or reduce their expectations of us  our stock price could decline or the liquidity of our common stock may be adversely impacted  which could create difficulty for investors to resell their shares of our common stock 
if our stock price is volatile  we may become subject to securities litigation  which is expensive and could result in a diversion of resources 
if our stock price experiences periods of volatility  our security holders may initiate securities class action litigation against us 
if we become involved in this type of litigation it could be very expensive and divert our management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
our charter documents  delaware law and stockholders rights plan will make it more difficult to acquire us and may discourage take over attempts and thus depress the market price of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock  to determine the powers  preferences  and rights and the qualifications  limitations  or restrictions granted to or imposed upon any unissued series of undesignated preferred stock and to fix the number of shares constituting any series and the designation of such series  without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the preferred stock could be issued with voting  liquidation  dividend  and other rights superior to the rights of our common stock 
furthermore  any preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to our common stock  and as a result  the issuance of any preferred stock could depress the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation eliminates the right of stockholders to act without a meeting and does not provide cumulative voting for the election of directors 
our certificate of incorporation also provides for a classified board of directors 
the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock and these other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management 
we are also subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could delay or prevent a change in control of us  impede a merger  consolidation  or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control 
any of these provisions  which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control  could adversely affect the market value of our common stock 
in  our board of directors adopted a rights agreement that is intended to protect our stockholders interests in the event we are confronted with coercive takeover tactics 
pursuant to the stockholders rights plan  we distributed rights to purchase up to  shares of our series a junior participating preferred stock 
under some circumstances  these rights become the rights to purchase shares of our common stock or securities of an acquiring entity at one half the market value 
the rights are not intended to prevent our takeover  rather they are designed to deal with the possibility of unilateral actions by hostile acquirers that could deprive our board of directors and stockholders of their ability to determine our destiny and obtain the highest price for our common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those set forth in item a of this report under the caption risks relating to our business  and other reports we file with the securities and exchange commission 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we provide services primarily to providers  payors  government agencies  pharmaceutical  biogenetic  and other healthcare organizations in north america  europe  and asia 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from fees for information technology outsourcing services and professional services 
we typically bill for our services on an hourly or fixed fee basis as specified by the agreement with a particular client 
for services billed on an hourly basis  in our consulting and systems integration businesses csi  fees are determined by multiplying the amount of time expended on each assignment by the project hourly rate for the staff members assigned to the engagement 
fixed fees  including outsourcing fees  are established on a per assignment or monthly basis and are based on several factors such as the size  scope  complexity and duration of an assignment  the number of our employees required to complete the assignment  and the volume of transactions or interactions 
revenues are generally recognized related to the level of services performed  the amount of cost incurred on the assignment versus the estimated total cost to complete the assignment  or on a straight line basis over the period of performance of service 
additionally  we have been licensing an increased amount of our software products  generally in conjunction with the customization and implementation of such software products 
revenues from our software licensing and maintenance were approximately of our net revenues in fiscal year  and we expect our software licensing revenues to continue to grow incrementally during our fiscal year 
we also expect our services revenues associated with the implementation of our software products to continue to become a more significant part of our overall services revenues 
provisions are made for estimated uncollectible amounts based on our historical experience 
we may obtain payment in advance of providing services 
these advances are recorded as customer advances and reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
out of pocket expenses billed and reimbursed by clients are included in total revenues  and then deducted to determine revenues before reimbursements net revenues 
for purposes of analysis  all percentages in this discussion are stated as a percentage of net revenues  since we believe that this is the more relevant measure of our business 
cost of services primarily consists of the salaries  bonuses  and related benefits of client serving staff  and subcontractor expenses 
selling expenses primarily consist of the salaries  benefits  travel  and other costs of our sales force  as well as marketing and market research expenses 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of the costs attributable to the support of our client serving professionals such as non billable travel  office space occupancy  information systems and infrastructure  salaries and expenses for executive management  financial accounting and administrative personnel  expenses for firm and business unit governance meetings  recruiting fees  professional development and training  and legal and other professional services 
as staff related costs are relatively fixed in the short term  variations in our revenues and operating results in our csi business can occur as a result of variations in billing margins and utilization rates of our billable associates 
our most significant expenses are our human resource and related salary and benefit expenses 
as of december   approximately  of our  employees are billable consultants and software developers 
another employees are part of our outsourcing business 
the salaries and benefits of such billable personnel staff and outsourcing related employees are recognized in our cost of services 
most non billable employee salaries and benefits are recognized as a component of either selling or general and administrative expenses 
approximately of our workforce  or employees  are classified as non billable 
our cost of services as a percentage of net revenues is directly related to several factors  including  but not limited to our staff utilization  which is the ratio of total billable hours to available hours in a given period  the amount and timing of cost incurred  our ability to control costs on our outsourcing projects  the billed rate on time and material contracts  and the estimated cost to complete our non outsourcing fixed price contracts 
in our outsourcing contracts  a significant portion of our revenues are fixed and allocated over the contract on a straight line basis  as we are required to provide a specified level of ongoing services 
also  certain revenues may fluctuate under the contracts based on the volume of transactions we process or other measurements of service provided 
if we incur higher costs to provide the required services or receive less revenue due to reduced transaction volumes or penalties associated with service level failures  our gross profit can be negatively impacted 
in our csi business  we manage staff utilization by monitoring assignment requirements and timetables  available and required skills  and available staff hours per week and per month 
differences in personnel utilization rates can result from variations in the amount of non billed time  which has historically consisted of training time  vacation time  time lost to illness and inclement weather  and unassigned time 
non billed time also includes time devoted to other necessary and productive activities such as sales support and interviewing prospective employees 
unassigned time results from differences in the timing of the completion of an existing assignment and the beginning of a new assignment 
in order to reduce and limit unassigned time  we actively manage personnel utilization by monitoring and projecting estimated engagement start and completion dates and matching staff availability with current and projected client requirements 
the number of people staffed on an assignment will vary according to the size  complexity  duration  and demands of the assignment 
assignment terminations  completions  inclement weather  and scheduling delays may result in periods in which staff members are not optimally utilized 
an unanticipated termination of a significant assignment or an overall lengthening of the sales cycle could result in a higher than expected number of unassigned staff members and could cause us to experience lower margins 
in addition  entry into new market areas and the hiring of staff in advance of client assignments have resulted and may continue to result in periods of lower staff utilization 
in response to competition and continued pricing and rate pressures  we have implemented a global sourcing strategy into our business operations  which includes the deployment of offshore resources as well as resources that perform services remote from the client site 
we also incorporate larger numbers of variable cost or per diem staff in some of our projects 
we expect these strategies to continue to reduce cost of services through a combination of lower cost attributable to offshore resources and higher leverage of resources that perform services offsite or on a variable cost basis 
to the extent we pass through reduced costs to our clients related to offshore resources  the global sourcing strategy may result in lower revenues on a per engagement basis 
however  we expect to offset this potential revenue impact with improved competitive positioning in our markets  which could result in an increased number of engagements to offset the potential revenue impact 
several of our competitors employ both global sourcing and variable staffing strategies to provide software development and other information technology services to their clients  while at the same time reducing their cost structure and improving the quality of services they provide 
if we are unable to realize the perceived cost benefits of our strategies or if we are unable to receive high quality services from foreign employees  variable staff employees  or subcontractors  our business may be adversely impacted and we may not be able to compete effectively 
restatement of previously reported audited annual consolidated financial information the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to certain restatement adjustments made to the previously reported consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and december  we have restated our historical consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and december   and the retained earnings as of the beginning of fiscal year the determination to restate these consolidated financial statements was made by our audit committee upon the recommendation of management as a result of the identification of miscalculations related to the accounting for state income taxes 
we have historically used the consolidated income and apportionment factors to estimate the state deferred tax assets and related contingency reserves that were recorded for uncertain tax positions  and did not update this analysis annually based on the filed tax positions in each state 
as a result  we did not accurately identify and record state tax net operating losses  resulting in excessive state tax contingency reserves accumulating on the balance sheet 
this process resulted in million of higher cumulative tax expense over the period from fiscal year through fiscal year in conjunction with the restatement  management and our independent registered public accounting firm have identified a material weakness in internal control related to our tax accounting described above 
as a result of this material weakness  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because we did not maintain effective controls over the determination and reporting of the provision for income taxes 
as a result  prior years are being restated to reverse the creation of these reserves  thus reducing tax expense in certain of those years 
the following is a summary of the impact of the restatement by year in thousands 
see item a and item of this report for additional information regarding the impact of these restatements on our controls and procedures and consolidated financial statements  respectively 
total overview of the year ended december  the following summarizes key aspects of our business and operating units overall  revenues increased in  primarily due to the addition of three outsourcing accounts two in health delivery and one in health plan 
however  we also had two large outsourcing contracts new york presbyterian and umass memorial terminate during the year and we have adjusted our revenue expectations for to account for the winding up of those engagements in december we have also adjusted our cost structure accordingly 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced and completed significant cost reduction initiatives to adjust our cost structure as mentioned above  and we expect that the cost reduction efforts will enable us to achieve operating profitability in the first quarter of as part of these cost reduction efforts  we reduced our sales force by approximately in health delivery and are implementing a more consultative sales model than we have used in the recent past 
our ability to achieve growth and future earnings is dependent upon our ability to successfully implement this revised sales model 
also in the fourth quarter of  our chief executive officer resigned at the request of our board of directors and as of the date of this report  we are continuing our search for a replacement 
we are currently operating with an interim management team  and a loss of any member of the current interim management team could have an adverse impact on our achieving operating objectives in we continue to implement our blended shore delivery model across all business units in an effort to capture market share and improve margins 
as a result  we had our highest ever number of chargeable hours during the fourth quarter of in our project business 
the majority of this increase was attributable to the software services and health plan businesses 
the health delivery sector represented approximately of our revenues in our primary focus in this sector is clinical implementations and outsourcing 
if the health delivery market more broadly accepts blended shore sourcing  we believe we are well positioned to expand market share  revenue  and margins 
in health delivery outsourcing  we expect this segment to represent a lesser percent of overall revenues due to the two contract terminations discussed above 
however  we also expect gross margin percentage to improve in  partially due to our contract at university hospitals in cleveland  where we extended the contract until march and as part of the extension  we assumed infrastructure services responsibility from a subcontractor that was providing services on the account on a zero margin pass through basis 
the wind down of the umass memorial contract in december is also expected to impact gross margin percentage positively 
our health delivery services segment revenues declined during due to lower prices on certain of the work we performed  and declining markets in a few of our service specialties 
this resulted in reduced gross margin in the segment 
we reduced headcount in this segment at the end of  which we expect will improve gross margin percentage in the segment at the beginning of our health plan business experienced losses for the whole of  but performed profitably in the second half and achieved growth during the year by focusing on blended shore implementations and outsourcing hosting services for regional health plans 
software services  which is part of our government and technology services segment  also performed well in and continues to experience a good pipeline of business for our offshore software development capabilities 
the life sciences and software products segments experienced losses in  however  we believe we have stabilized costs in those units and our firstdoc product suite remains a market leader in the life sciences and pharmaceutical space 
in life sciences  we have made efforts to tighten project controls and selling discipline to better manage our project margins 
meanwhile  in software products  we continued to invest in the development of firstgateways in  and that business has been awarded two contracts in the rhio market 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenues 
our net revenues increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  our total revenues increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  the increases in net revenues were in health delivery outsourcing  government and technology services  and health plan  offset by decreases in health delivery services and life sciences 
the health delivery outsourcing segment had the most significant increase  million  or  primarily due to million in revenues from two new outsourcing engagements  which began in the quarter ended september  the remaining increase in revenues in that segment is due to a number of smaller contracts executed over the past months 
government and technology services grew by million  or  primarily due to growth in fcg software services formerly named paragon solutions  inc  which provides offshore software development services to independent software vendors 
health plan grew by million  or due to the receipt of a significant outsourcing contract  and increased services revenue related to market acceptance of fcg s onshore offshore delivery model 
the most significant offsetting decrease was in health delivery services  which declined by million  or  due to several factors  including the wind down of some larger consulting projects  increased competition for projects from software vendors  and market based billing rate pressures and lower demand in our revenue cycle  meditech  and erp consulting practices 
during the fourth quarter of  we ceased performing both the revenue cycle and erp consulting service offerings for our clients 
additionally  revenues in our life sciences business declined by million  or due to our focus on selling and servicing firstdoc software clients and the completion of custom and non firstdoc project work 
in august  we began a five year it outsourcing agreement with one client  and a three year agreement with another client 
annual revenues from these two clients are expected to total approximately million 
in july  we announced the early termination for convenience by the new york and presbyterian hospital nyph of our approximately million per year outsourcing agreement  effective december  the contract was executed in november and was originally scheduled to expire in december 
also  in october  we announced the mutually agreed termination of our outsourcing agreement with umass memorial health care ummhc effective november   with certain transition services to be performed through december  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year of  we earned approximately  of termination fees from this contract 
in each of these cases  the client decided to in source the services we had been providing  either in whole or in part 
the expected net result of these recent developments in our outsourcing business will be a significant decrease in revenues as of the beginning of to a level in the range of approximately million per quarter  assuming no other changes in our outsourcing business 
we have recently received a one year extension of one of our existing major outsourcing contracts  university of pennsylvania health system uphs  and that contract is now set to expire in march we currently receive annual revenues of approximately million from this contract 
during the current extension period  we intend to negotiate in good faith with uphs on pricing and service levels applicable to the one year extension  and until then  current pricing and service levels apply 
we currently have no assurances that the contract will be extended past the one year renewal period  and uphs still has the right to terminate the contract for convenience on days notice 
if we are unable to execute a longer term renewal with uphs or if we are unable to enter into new outsourcing engagements  our health delivery outsourcing revenues would be adversely impacted 
revenues in our business units other than outsourcing are not expected to change significantly from their levels at the end of fiscal year  with some modest growth expected to continue in the health plan and government and technology services segments 
growth in health delivery services and outsourcing is highly dependent upon capturing market share through acceptance by the health delivery market of our blended shore delivery model 
overall  if we do not otherwise convert potential opportunities in our outsourcing pipeline  we expect our percentage mix of outsourcing revenues in to be less than in prior years  primarily due to the loss of revenues associated with nyph and ummhc 
cost of services 
cost of services before reimbursable expenses increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to million of additional costs in the health delivery outsourcing segment  of which million was associated with the two new contracts  and the remainder was due to costs related to other contracts executed over the past months and higher costs on the ummhc contract 
a greater portion of these costs relate to internal headcount than previously  as we have reduced our reliance on a significant infrastructure subcontractor 
cost of services grew modestly in the health plan and government and technology services businesses in order to serve the revenue growth in those segments 
cost of services declined in life sciences due to attrition and cost reductions we made to adjust for the revenue decline in that segment 
additionally  we incurred approximately million of severance costs in the fourth quarter of the year 
this was primarily in health delivery services  related to the layoff of staff who had been performing revenue cycle and erp consulting services for our clients  and in health delivery outsourcing  to reduce costs related to the loss of contracts which concluded in the fourth quarter of gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december   a decrease of from million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million reduction in health delivery services segment gross profit  declining to of net revenues for the year ended december  from of net revenues for the year ended december  this decrease was due to the million decline in revenues in health delivery services during fiscal year which was primarily attributable to market based pricing pressures  while cost of services had increased by million 
we expect these pricing pressures to be offset somewhat by our movement toward more blended shore service delivery 
approximately half of the increase in cost of services in health delivery services was due to severance incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year to reduce costs 
our overall gross profit percentage is expected to increase in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to the significant decline in the revenue mix of lower margin health delivery outsourcing revenues as discussed above  combined with cost reductions in health delivery services 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased slightly to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  selling expenses in the fourth quarter of included approximately  of severance 
selling expenses are expected to decline by approximately of revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to reductions in the size of the sales force 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  the increase was entirely due to non salary costs  as general and administrative salary costs declined by approximately million during the year 
the most significant increase was attributable to infrastructure costs of approximately million related to facilities and equipment needed to directly support our outsourcing business 
further  we incurred million million in the fourth quarter of severance costs for the year ended december  compared to approximately  for the year ended december  a significant share of the fourth quarter severance related to the departure of our ceo rather than to cost reductions 
we also incurred million of facility closure costs  primarily in the life sciences segment  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year finally  we experienced higher costs in a number of other areas including outside professional services such as audit  legal  and consulting costs  nonbillable travel  recruiting costs  and rent in our growing offshore shared service centers 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses are expected to decline slightly in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to cost reductions  however  increases in other costs such as additional infrastructure costs may offset part of the effect of those reductions 
interest income  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  increased to  for the year ended december   an increase of from  for the year ended december   due to higher interest rates earned on cash and investments partially offset by the slightly reduced level of cash and investments on which interest is earned 
interest income  net of interest expense as a percentage of net revenues increased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  other expenses  net 
other expense decreased to  for the year ended december   a decrease of from  for the year ended december   when we recorded an  impairment of our investment in a privately held software company 
current year expense primarily related to foreign currency transaction losses 
expense for premium on repurchase of stock 
in the first quarter of  we repurchased million shares of our common stock and certain stock options from a major stockholder at a premium to the then current market price see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the aggregate purchase price for the shares and the options represented a premium of approximately to the market price of our common stock on the date we repurchased such stock 
as a result  we recorded a pretax charge of approximately million  without any tax benefit  for such premium included in the purchase consideration 
income taxes 
we recorded an million tax provision for the year ended december  versus a  tax provision for the year ended december  the tax provision for the year ended december  primarily consisted of a million tax asset valuation allowance recorded during the second and fourth quarters of  partially offset by million of current year tax benefits against the pretax loss 
the valuation allowance was recorded as a result of the recent historical losses we have incurred  creating additional negative evidence as to the uncertainty of our ability to realize our deferred tax assets see critical accounting policies and estimates deferred income taxes 
the tax provision for the year ended december  of  consisted of an expense of million offset by a reduction in deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million due to management s belief that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize more of our deferred tax assets 
loss on discontinued operations 
the disposition of our coactive call center service line has been accounted for as a discontinued operation 
for the year ended december   we incurred  of costs related to the operation and wind down of the business 
these costs  net of a tax benefit  resulted in a net loss of  compared to a net loss from the operation and disposition of this discontinued operation of million for the year ended december  comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenues 
our net revenues decreased slightly to million for the year ended december   a decrease of less than from million for the year ended december  our total revenues increased slightly to million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  total and net revenues remained relatively unchanged as a result of revenue increases in our health delivery outsourcing and health delivery services business segments  offset by revenue decreases in the health plan and life sciences segments 
net revenues in our health delivery outsourcing segment increased million  or  due to new outsourcing clients and the beneficial impact of an additional week of revenue in our fiscal calendar compared to the prior year  which added approximately million of revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal year our health plan net revenues decreased million  or  due to the completion of several significant projects during late and early  without having new projects to replace them 
likewise  our life sciences segment net revenues decreased million  or  due to the windup of certain custom software development work which was completed in our fiscal year included a rd week and a th week in the fourth quarter  reflecting the normal synchronization between our fiscal year and calendar years which occurs once every five to six years 
as a result  our revenues and costs for the fourth quarter were somewhat higher than our then recent historical trends otherwise indicated especially in health delivery outsourcing  although much less than a full one thirteenth higher  since the extra week encompassed much of the december holiday period  which is typically slow for us 
cost of services 
cost of services before reimbursable expenses declined slightly to million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million for the year ended december  there were significant changes in our business segments that resulted in this million decrease 
the most significant change was a reduction in life sciences united states headcount commensurate with the related decline in revenues  and the transfer of some less costly offshore associates into life sciences in the third quarter of  generating a million  or  decrease in that segment s cost of services before reimbursable expenses 
additionally  headcount decreased in health plan driving a million  or  decrease in that segment s costs of services before reimbursable expenses  although not proportionate to the significant decline in revenues in that segment 
as an offset  health delivery outsourcing increased its cost of services before reimbursable expenses by million  or  due to the increase in revenues and the additional week in our fiscal year 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december   an increase of from million  or of net revenues  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in health delivery outsourcing gross margin of million and smaller increases in several other business units  offset by a decrease in health plan gross margin of million 
health delivery outsourcing increased its gross margin to of net revenues in from in by improving margins on existing contracts  partially through the increased utilization of offshore resources to reduce costs 
although life sciences gross margin declined slightly in absolute dollars  its gross margin percentage increased to in from in based on utilizing less expensive offshore resources within our shared service center 
meanwhile  health plan s gross margin declined to from due to an inability to cut costs in line with the major revenue reduction experienced in that segment 
selling expenses 
selling expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to reductions in our sales force 
selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   a decrease of from million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted from cost reductions in the latter part of  including the consolidation of the administrative operations of several of our acquired companies 
general and administrative expenses increased in the fourth quarter of in large part due to non labor costs  such as infrastructure costs related to facilities and equipment needed to directly support our growing outsourcing business 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  restructuring charges 
we did not incur any restructuring charges for the year ended december   compared to million of such costs incurred for the year ended december  restructuring charges for the year ended december  included approximately million of severance costs related to staff reductions and million for facility downsizing and fixed asset write downs 
interest income  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  decreased slightly to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to reduced invested cash levels resulting from the repurchase of approximately million of our common stock from a major stockholder in february interest income  net of interest expense as a percentage of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  other expenses  net 
other expenses increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   due primarily to the  impairment of our investment in a privately held software company 
expense for premium on repurchase of stock 
in the first quarter of  we repurchased million shares of our common stock and certain stock options from a major stockholder at a premium to the then current market price see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the aggregate purchase price for the shares and the options represented a premium of approximately to the market price of our common stock on the date we repurchased such stock 
as a result  we recorded a pretax charge of approximately million  without any tax benefit  for such premium included in the purchase consideration 
income taxes 
our provision for taxes for the year ended december  of  consisted of a tax expense of million offset by a reduction in deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million due to management s belief that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize more of our deferred tax assets see critical accounting policies and estimates deferred income taxes 
the million expense prior to the valuation allowance reversal reflects a tax rate of related to our million of pre tax income from continuing operations  excluding the million non deductible premium on the repurchase of stock described above 
our tax benefit rate for the year ended december  was  excluding the million valuation allowance taken in that year due to the uncertainty of realizing all of our tax assets 
the provision rate in fiscal year was higher than the benefit rate in due to the non deductibility of certain of our expenses 
loss on discontinued operations 
we incurred a loss on our discontinued call center operations of million  net of tax  in of this loss   million was from the operations of the business during the year  and million was from the impairment of assets  primarily goodwill  in the fourth quarter of the year 
this compared to a loss of  net of tax  in factors affecting quarterly results a substantial portion of our expenses  particularly depreciation  office rent  and occupancy costs  and  in the short run  personnel and related costs are relatively fixed 
our quarterly operating results may vary significantly in the future depending on a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these factors are detailed elsewhere in this report under item a  risks relating to our business and may include the reduction in size  delay in commencement  interruption  or termination of one or more significant engagements or assignments  fluctuations in consultant hiring and utilization  the use of offsite and offshore resources on our engagements  the ability to incorporate use of variable labor staffing into our projects  the loss of key personnel and other employees  the loss of one or more significant clients in any of our business segments  the unpredictability of engaging new clients and additional assignments from existing clients  increased competition and pricing pressures  timing and collection of fees and payments  write offs of client billings  service level credits and penalties associated with our outsourcing engagements  consolidation of  and subsequent reduction in  the number of healthcare providers  the number  timing  and contractual terms of significant client engagements  fluctuations in market demand for our services  consultant hiring  and utilization  delays or increased expenses incurred in connection with existing assignments  variations in the timing of expenses  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  changes in our business strategies  variability in the number of business days within a quarter  costs associated with the winding down and disposition of our call center services business  the timing of certain general and administrative expenses  the ability to generate sufficient income to realize our deferred tax assets  international currency fluctuations  and expenses related to the issuance of stock options to our employees 
due to the foregoing factors  quarterly revenues and operating results are not predictable with any significant degree of accuracy 
in particular  the timing between initial client contract and fulfillment of the criteria necessary for revenue recognition can be lengthy and unpredictable  and revenues in any given quarter can be materially adversely affected as a result of such unpredictability 
business practices of clients  such as deferring commitments on new assignments until after the end of fiscal periods  could require us to maintain a significant number of under utilized consultants  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we typically experience a lower number of billable days in certain quarters of the year  particularly the fourth quarter when many of our employees typically take vacation during the december holidays 
in fiscal year  we had an extra week in the fourth quarter due to our fiscal calendar  which more than offset this vacation impact on a one time basis 
variability in the number of billable days may also result from other factors such as vacation days  sick time  paid and unpaid leave  inclement weather  and holidays  all of which could produce variability in our revenues and costs 
in the event of any downturn in potential clients businesses or the economy in general  planned utilization of our services may be deferred or cancelled  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
based on the preceding factors  we may experience a shortfall in revenues or earnings from expected levels or otherwise fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or the market in general  which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we generated cash flow from continuing operations of million 
we used million to repurchase shares of our common stock from the previous owners of fcg infrastructure services  inc formerly codigent solutions group  inc further  we used approximately million of cash to purchase property and equipment  primarily information technology and related equipment  including infrastructure equipment for our data center and help desk 
at december   we had cash and investments available for sale of million compared to million at december  one of our new outsourcing accounts  which began in august  had a net negative impact on cash of over million for the year ended  primarily due to an agreed upon deferral of fees  transition costs  and capital expenditures  and will have an additional negative impact of approximately million in the first quarter of due to further agreed upon fee deferrals and transition and capital costs 
this use of cash was generally offset in fiscal year by the collection of million of long term receivables from our new york presbyterian hospital outsourcing account  half of which was collected at the end of the year due to the termination for convenience of the contract by the client 
on december   we laid off a number of employees 
of the million of severance and facility closure expenses included in the fourth quarter of  million was severance  of which million was paid during that quarter 
in early january  we paid the remaining million of severance 
in february  we signed an agreement with a landlord to return excess space to them 
as part of the agreement  we are required to make million of payments to them evenly over the last ten months of fiscal year in order to extinguish our obligation 
these payments will be charged against amounts which have been accrued in fiscal year and prior years for facility closure costs  and thus will affect cash flow in fiscal year without affecting pretax income 
our days sales outstanding dso of accounts receivable were at an all time low at the end of fiscal year this was due to the unusually large share of our revenue mix being in health delivery outsourcing  which has a very low dso historically 
we expect dso to increase by approximately five to ten days beginning in the first quarter of  primarily due to outsourcing becoming a smaller percentage of overall revenue after the winding down of two outsourcing accounts  and assuming no other changes in the collectibility of current accounts 
we do not currently expect any significant cash flow changes related to the other elements of the working capital cycle such as accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  however  we are susceptible to ongoing routine fluctuations in these areas 
our cash flow in fiscal year will be highly dependent on our ability to achieve profitability 
generally  we expect our pretax profitability in fiscal year will contribute positively to cash flow 
a significant amount of any future income over million is not expected to be subject to federal taxation or require any significant book tax provision in our income statement 
we had a revolving line of credit  under which we were allowed to borrow up to million at an interest rate of the prevailing prime rate with an expiration of may  there was no outstanding balance under the line of credit at december  or december  due to repeated loan covenant violations related to our quarterly losses  we elected to discontinue the line of credit subsequent to december  rather than accept new restrictive conditions to the credit line which were proposed by the bank 
as of december   the following table summarizes our contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total operating leases  net of subleases purchase obligations total management believes that our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
our cash and cash equivalents are available for capital expenditures which are projected at approximately million for  upfront setup costs and deferred fees on new contracts  strategic investments  mergers and acquisitions  and other potential large scale cash needs that may arise

critical accounting policies and estimates the foregoing discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  cost to complete client engagements  valuation of goodwill and long lived and intangible assets  accrued liabilities  income taxes  restructuring costs  idle facilities  litigation and disputes  and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from our estimates and we do not assume any obligation to update any forward looking information 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  accounts receivable  and unbilled receivables revenues are derived primarily from information technology outsourcing services  consulting  and systems integration 
revenues are recognized on a time and materials  level of effort  percentage of completion  or straight line basis 
before revenues are recognized  the following four criteria must be met a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  b delivery has occurred or services rendered  c the fee is fixed and determinable  and d collectability is reasonably assured 
we determine if the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured based on our judgments regarding the nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered 
arrangements vary in length from less than one year to seven years 
the longer term arrangements are generally level of effort or fixed price arrangements 
revenues from time and materials arrangements are generally recognized based upon contracted hourly billing rates as the work progresses 
revenues from level of effort arrangements are recognized based upon a fixed price for the level of resources provided 
revenues from fixed fee arrangements for consulting and systems integration work are generally recognized on a rate per hour or percentage of completion basis 
we maintain  for each of our fixed fee contracts  estimates of total revenue and cost over the contract term 
for purposes of periodic financial reporting on the fixed price consulting and system integration contracts  we accumulate total actual costs incurred to date under the contract 
the ratio of those actual costs to our then current estimate of total costs for the life of the contract is then applied to our then current estimate of total revenues for the life of the contract to determine the portion of total estimated revenues that should be recognized 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
revenues recognized on fixed price consulting and system integration contracts are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  do not complete our projects within the planned periods of time  or do not satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then profit may be significantly and negatively affected 
revisions in our contract estimates are reflected in the period in which the determination is made that facts and circumstances dictate a change of estimate 
favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenues recognized  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenues 
provisions for estimated losses on individual contracts are made in the period in which the loss first becomes known 
some contracts include incentives for achieving either schedule targets  cost targets  or other defined goals 
revenues from incentive type arrangements are recognized when it is probable they will be earned 
we account for certain of our outsourcing contracts using eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items  and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 
arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent on the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
in our outsourcing contracts  a significant portion of our revenues are fixed and allocated over the contract on a straight line basis  as we are required to provide a specified level of services subject to certain performance measurements 
also  certain revenues may fluctuate under the contracts based on the volume of transactions we process or other measurements of service provided 
if we incur higher costs to provide the required services or receive lower revenues due to reduced transaction volumes or penalties associated with service level failures  our gross profit can be negatively impacted 
on certain contracts  or elements of contracts  costs are incurred subsequent to the signing of the contract  but prior to the rendering of service and associated recognition of revenue 
where such costs are incurred and realization of those costs is either paid for upfront or guaranteed by the contract  those costs are deferred and later expensed over the period of recognition of the related revenue 
at december   we had deferred million of unamortized costs which are included in non current assets 
one of our recent contract awards includes approximately  of setup and transition costs not yet incurred  so our deferred costs are expected to increase in the first quarter of fiscal year as part of our on going operations to provide services to our customers  incidental expenses  which are generally reimbursable under the terms of the contracts  are billed to customers 
these expenses are recorded as both revenues and direct cost of services in accordance with the provisions of eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  and include expenses such as airfare  mileage  hotel stays  out of town meals  and telecommunication charges 
software license and maintenance revenues comprised approximately of our net revenues in fiscal year additionally  we realized substantial additional revenues from the implementation of our software 
we recognize software revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide related professional services  including consulting  training  and implementation services  as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
most of our software license fee revenues are from arrangements which include implementation services that are essential to the functionality of our software products  and are recognized using contract accounting  including the percentage of completion methodology  over the period of the implementation 
in those more limited cases where our software arrangements do not include services essential to the functionality of the product  license fee revenues are recognized when the software product has been shipped  provided a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is considered probable 
we do not generally offer rights of return or acceptance clauses to our customers 
in situations where we do provide rights of return or acceptance clauses  revenue is deferred until the clause expires 
typically  our software license fees are due within a twelve month period from the date of shipment 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  including payment terms greater than twelve months from shipment  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
in software arrangements that include rights to multiple software products  specified upgrades  maintenance or services  we allocate the total arrangement fee among the deliverables using the fair value of each of the deliverables determined using vendor specific objective evidence 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is determined using the price charged when that element is sold separately 
in software arrangements in which we have fair value of all undelivered elements but not of a delivered element  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element s and is recognized as revenue 
in software arrangements in which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements  revenue is deferred until fair value is determined or all elements have been delivered 
revenues from training and consulting services are recognized as services are provided to customers 
revenues from maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreements 
revenues for customer support and maintenance that are bundled with the initial license fee are deferred based on the fair value of the bundled support services and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  fair value is based on the renewal rate for continued support arrangements 
unbilled receivables of million represent revenues recognized for services performed that were not billed at the balance sheet date 
the majority of these amounts are billed in the subsequent month  however  certain unbillable amounts arising from contracts occur when revenues recognized exceed allowable billings in accordance with the contractual agreements 
such unbillable amounts most often become billable upon reaching certain project milestones stipulated per the contract  or in accordance with the percentage of completion methodology 
as of december   we had unbillable amounts of approximately million  which were generally expected to be billed within one year 
we had a long term receivable of million at december  related to a single major outsourcing contract with a term of seven years 
this receivable was originally scheduled to be billed and collected during fiscal years and through contractual billings in excess of the amounts to be earned as revenues  however  due to the early termination of the contract for convenience by the client  the payments were received in full on december  of the long term receivables of million at december   million was created in august through the deferral until of the first month of fees of a new outsourcing contract 
an additional amount of approximately  related to this contract will be deferred in january customer advances are comprised of payments from customers for which services have not yet been performed or prepayments against work in process 
these unearned revenues are deferred and recognized as future contract costs are incurred and as contract services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
this allowance is based on the amount and aging of our accounts receivable  creditworthiness of our clients  historical collection experience  current economic trends  and changes in client payment patterns 
if the financial condition of our clients was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
our bad debt losses have generally been moderate due to the size and quality of our customers  however  we have recently incurred some bad debt losses in our growing software services segment due to the lower credit quality of our clients in that segment  and have had to increase our bad debt reserves accordingly 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is a particularly difficult estimate to make  because if one of our larger clients unexpectedly became unable to pay us  our allowance would have to increase suddenly 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements which differ from our tax returns 
we use significant estimates in determining what portion of our deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized 
our net deferred tax assets had historically consisted primarily of the tax benefit related to restructuring costs for facility closures  supplemental executive retirement plan contributions  and other accrued liabilities such as accrued vacation pay  which are not deductible for tax purposes until paid 
during fiscal year  we generated additional deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards which were created by our pretax losses combined with the fact that we were outside the period it is allowable to carry back losses 
taking into account our then recent history of cumulative losses  we recorded a valuation allowance of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year together with a full valuation allowance of million we had already taken against the net operating loss carryforwards of companies we had previously acquired  we had a valuation allowance of million against a total deferred tax asset of million at december  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we re evaluated our requirement for a valuation allowance after having completed a full year in which we recorded taxable income in each quarter 
at that time  we determined that it was more likely than not we would realize an additional million of our deferred tax assets and recorded a tax benefit in this amount 
during the first quarter of  we incurred a pretax loss  however  based on management s expectation of pretax earnings for  no change in the valuation allowance was recorded 
during the first six months of  we incurred a pretax loss from continuing operations of million 
based on such performance  we increased our deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the second quarter of by million 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of after having incurred losses in each quarter of the fiscal year  we increased our valuation allowance by another million such that we now have a full valuation allowance against all of our tax assets 
this valuation allowance does not  in any way  limit our ability to use our deferred tax assets  primarily loss carryforwards  to offset taxable income in the future 
as well as not being subject to federal taxation other than the alternative minimum tax  a significant amount approximately million of any future pretax income will not require a significant tax provision in the income statement 
additionally  if at some point in the future  the realization of any of our deferred tax assets is considered more likely than not based on successive years of generating taxable income  we will reverse all or a portion of any existing valuation allowance at that time 
our valuation allowance for deferred income taxes has been a particularly volatile estimate over the past several years  as our level of income and loss has fluctuated  requiring us to reassess the likelihood of realization of our tax assets 
goodwill and intangible assets under sfas  we no longer amortize our goodwill and are required to complete an annual impairment testing which we perform during the fourth quarter of each year 
we believe that the accounting assumptions and estimates related to the annual goodwill impairment testing are critical because these can change from period to period 
we use various assumptions such as discount rates  and comparable company analysis in performing these valuations 
the impairment test requires us to forecast our future cash flows  which involves significant judgment 
accordingly  if our expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  our estimate of the fair value of our reporting units could change significantly resulting in a goodwill impairment charge  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we performed an impairment test on each of our components of goodwill as of the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that none of our goodwill was impaired 
as of december   we have million of goodwill and million of intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet see note o of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
recent accounting pronouncements see note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents ie  short term and long term cash investments  accounts receivable  unbilled receivables  and accounts payable 
only the cash and cash equivalents which totaled million at december  present us with market risk exposure resulting primarily from changes in interest rates 
based on this balance  a change of one percent in the interest rate would cause a change in interest income for the annual period of approximately  our objective in maintaining these investments is the flexibility obtained in having cash available for payment of accrued liabilities and acquisitions
