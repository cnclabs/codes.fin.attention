critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that require assumptions or judgments to be made based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates 
those policies have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than reported if there is a change to any of the estimates  assumptions or judgments made by management 
based on the potential impact to the financial statements of the valuation methods  estimates  assumptions and judgments used  management identified the determination of the reserve for credit losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights  the valuation of leased asset residuals and the valuation of pension and postretirement obligations to be the accounting estimates that are the most subjective and or judgmental 
reserve for credit losses a consequence of lending activities is that losses may be experienced 
the amount of such losses will vary from time to time depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by economic conditions  including rising interest rates  and the financial performance of borrowers 
the company maintains a reserve which consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses allowance and a reserve for unfunded commitments unfunded reserve 
the reserve provides for the risk of credit losses inherent in the credit extension process and is based on a range of loss estimates derived from a comprehensive quarterly evaluation  reflecting analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience  supplemented as necessary by credit judgment to address observed changes in trends  conditions  and other relevant environmental and economic factors 
the allowance and the unfunded reserve are both increased and decreased through the provisioning process 
the adequacy of the allowance and the unfunded reserve is based on a range of inherent loss estimates derived from a comprehensive quarterly analysis of historical loss experience  plus an amount for credit management judgment reflecting the evaluation of the impact of environmental factors on portfolio performance  plus an amount for imprecision of estimates 
there is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item  describes the methodologies used to develop the reserve 
the determination of the amount of the reserve is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and significant judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios and deliberation on economic factors and trends 
there is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
each quarter  senior level committees approve specific credit and reserve related activities 
also each quarter  the audit committee of the board of directors reviews and approves the reserve prior to final affirmation by the board of directors 
mortgage servicing rights valuation when mortgage loans are sold with servicing retained  a servicing asset is established and accounted for based on estimated fair values 
once mortgage servicing rights have been recorded  they must be periodically evaluated for impairment 
impairment occurs when the current estimated fair value of mortgage servicing rights is less than the book value 
the current estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which require management to make estimates and assumptions regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  loan repayment rates  costs to service and interest rates that reflect the risk involved 
the value of these assets is sensitive to changes in the estimates and assumptions made 
had the company assumed that interest rates would decrease and prepayment rates increase  then the value of the mortgage servicing rights could have been lower 
note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes further discussion on the accounting for these assets and a sensitivity analysis  is incorporated by reference in this item 
residual valuation of leased assets lease financing receivables include a residual value component  which represents the estimated value of leased assets upon lease expiration 
the determination of expected value at lease termination is derived from a variety of sources  including equipment valuation services  appraisals and publicly available market data on recent sales transactions on similar equipment 
the length of time until termination  the cyclical nature of equipment values and the limited marketplace for re sale for certain leased assets are important variables considered in making this determination 
the company updates its valuation analysis on an annual basis  or more often when events or circumstances warrant 
when it is determined that a residual value is higher than the expected fair market value at lease expiration  the difference is recorded as an asset impairment in the period in which the analysis was completed 
the company is unable to predict future events or conditions that could result in future asset impairments 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion on the accounting for these assets and is incorporated by reference in this item 
pension and postretirement plans the company s pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic cost are actuarially determined based on the following key assumptions discount rate  estimated future return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rate 
the determination of the pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic cost is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash out flows for benefit payments and cash in flows for maturities and returns on investments  mortality rates  future health care cost and other factors  and changes in any or all of the underlying estimates  factors or assumptions could have a material impact to the financial statements 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic cost 
the discount rate used to value the future benefit obligation as of each year end is the rate used to determine the periodic expense in the next year 
the discount rate of used for the december  valuations was determined based on match funding maturities and interest payments on corporate bonds available in the market place to projected cash flows for future benefit payments 
in determining the net periodic cost  the company lowered the discount rate to in from used in and used in  reflecting the decline in market interest rates during these periods 
the estimated return on plan assets of was based on historical trends and a building block approach taking into account the type of investments in the pension plan 
the health care cost trend rate for was and will decrease by annually until reaching the ultimate trend rate of in a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased the total pension and postretirement net periodic cost in by approximately million and the benefit obligations at december  by million 
a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased the total pension and postretirement net periodic cost in by approximately million and the benefit obligations at december  by million 
a change in the health care cost trend rate would have changed the net periodic postretirement cost by approximately million 
the estimated pension and postretirement net periodic cost for is million based on a discount rate of 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the total pension and postretirement net periodic cost by approximately million 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion on the accounting for these plans and is incorporated by reference in this item

net interest income net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis increased million or from the increase in net interest income was largely a result of higher income earned on the loan and investment securities portfolios 
the investment securities portfolio  which consists primarily of mortgage backed securities  experienced an increase in interest income due to higher yields on securities acquired and a reduction in prepayments 
interest income from loans increased from as a result of higher yields earned  which was consistent with increases in benchmark interest rates eg prime  and higher average balances 
the average balance of commercial and industrial loans increased from as a result of continued new loan growth while home equity loans increased during the year 
partially offsetting these increases in interest income was a rise in interest expense on interest bearing deposits and short term borrowings  as a result of increases in short term interest rates during the year

the increase in investment securities portfolio was partially offset by a decrease in interest income on loans 
interest income on loans decreased mainly due to the lower income earned on mortgage loans as a result of lower yields in compared to the decline in interest expense from interest bearing deposits was mainly due to lower average rates paid on savings and time deposits 
the net interest margin was in  a nine basis points increase from the improvement in the margin was attributable to the improvement in the average yield earned on the investment securities portfolio and a basis point decline in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits  primarily savings and time deposits which lowered the company s cost of funds

it is determined through detailed quarterly analytical reviews of the loan and commitment portfolios 
in  the company recorded a provision of million whereas  in  the company returned million to income from a release from the allowance

total assets under administration were billion  billion and billion adjusted for sale of corporate trust business in the first quarter of at december   and  respectively 
the increase in trust and asset management income in from is consistent with the increase in equity markets which led to an increase in the company s average market value of assets under management 
in addition  trust and asset management income increased due to higher advisory fees on money market assets 
mortgage banking income is comprised primarily of gains from sales of loans and net servicing income 
net servicing income is income earned for servicing loans less the amortization of mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates 
mortgage banking income increased in as compared to largely as a result of a decline in the amortization of servicing rights attributable to a decrease in prepayments 
mortgage loan production volume approximately billion was consistent with mortgage banking income declined in as compared to largely as a result of a decrease in mortgage loan production 
mortgage interest rates hit record lows in  which led to a record year for production 
the decreased production volume in combined with competitive sales margins and a change in the mix of production to more variable rate loans led to lower gains on sale of loans 
gains from the sale of loans declined million and other fees declined million in from however  the decline in re financings benefited the company as loan prepayments declined by resulting in an increase in net servicing income of 
fees  exchange and other service charges are primarily comprised of merchant service activity  fees from atms and other loan fees and service charges

total salaries and benefits declined in both and compared to the respective preceding year  however  components have varied each year 
the decrease in was primarily due to lower stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock units and lower base salaries as a result of a decline in the number of employees 
the average number of employees declined in both and compared to the respective preceding year 
offsetting the decline in base salaries in was an increase in retirement and other benefits due to increased expense for actuarial determined benefits as a result of changes in the discount rate 
total salaries and benefits declined in compared to due to decreases in salaries and commission expense  partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation expense

business segments the company s business segments are defined as retail banking  commercial banking  investment services group and treasury and other corporate 
the company s internal management accounting process measures the performance of the business segments based on the management structure of the company 
this process  which is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution  uses various techniques to assign balance sheet and income statement amounts to the business segments  including allocations of interest income  expense overhead  the provision and capital 
this process is dynamic and requires certain allocations based on judgment and subjective factors 
unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management accounting that is equivalent to us generally accepted accounting principles 
previously reported results have been reclassified to conform to the current organizational reporting structure 
the company evaluates several performance measures of the business segments  the most important of which are net income after capital charge niacc and risk adjusted return on capital raroc 
niacc is economic net income less a charge for the cost of allocated capital 
the cost of allocated capital is determined by multiplying management s estimate of a shareholder s minimum required rate of return on the cost of capital invested currently by the segment s allocated equity 
the company assumes a cost of capital that is equal to a risk free rate plus a risk premium 
raroc is the ratio of economic net income to risk adjusted equity 
equity is allocated to each business segment based on an assessment of its inherent risk 
the net interest income of the business segments reflects the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics and reflects the allocation of net interest income related to the company s overall asset and liability management activities on a proportionate basis 
the basis for the allocation of net interest income is a function of management decisions and assumptions that are subject to change based on changes in current interest rate and market conditions 
funds transfer pricing also serves to transfer interest rate risk to the treasury segment 
however  the other business segments have some latitude to retain certain interest rate exposures related to customer pricing decisions within guidelines 
the provision recorded in the retail banking  commercial banking and investment services group segments represents actual net charge offs of these segments 
the provision charged to the treasury and other corporate segment represents residual changes in the level of the reserve 
the business segments are charged an economic provision which is a statistically derived estimate of average annual expected credit losses over an economic cycle 
on a consolidated basis  the company considers niacc a measure of shareholder value creation 
for the year ended december   consolidated niacc was million  compared to million in  a result of improved financial performance and more efficient use of capital 
financial results for each of the segments are presented in table and note of the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item

reductions in operating risk and the further refinement of credit risk factors resulted in a lower charge for capital 
the increase in provision over was primarily the result of a leveraged lease charge off in relation to the bankruptcy of a major airline carrier 
the improvement in the segment s financial measures for compared with was primarily due to an increase in non interest income and a decrease in capital charge  partially offset by a decrease in net interest income 
the increase in non interest income was a result of a gain on the sale of assets at the end of a leveraged lease transaction  a leasing partnership investment distribution and increased insurance income 
this was offset by a decrease in net interest income due to a decrease in the earnings credit from funds transfer pricing on the segment s deposit account balances  reflective of lower interest rates 
total non interest expense declined in from because of decreases in salaries and lower allocated expenses from support units within the company 
the charge for capital decreased because of the refinement of credit risk factors

in addition  during  million was reclassified to other liabilities from the allowance relating to the unfunded reserve

the process used to determine the unfunded reserve is consistent with the process for determining the allowance as adjusted for estimated funding probabilities or loan equivalency factors 
the unfunded reserve at december  was million compared with million at december  market risk market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
the company is exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting its business activities 
financial products that expose the company to market risk include investment securities  loans  deposits  debt and derivative financial instruments 
the company s market risk management process involves measuring  monitoring  controlling and managing risks that can significantly impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in this management process  market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance and shareholder value  while limiting the volatility of each 
the activities associated with these market risks are categorized into trading and other than trading 
the company s trading activities include foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts that expose the company to a minor degree of foreign currency risk 
these transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers and at times for the company s own account 
the company s other than trading activities include normal business transactions that expose the company s balance sheet profile to varying degrees of market risk 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
a key element in the process of managing market risk involves oversight by senior management and the board of directors as to the level of such risk assumed by the company in its balance sheet 
the board of directors reviews and approves risk management policies  including risk limits and guidelines and delegates oversight functions to the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco  consisting of senior business and finance officers  monitors the company s market risk exposure and  as market conditions dictate  modifies balance sheet positions 
the alco may also direct the use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk the company s balance sheet is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from the company s normal business activities of making loans  taking deposits and purchasing securities 
many other factors also affect the company s exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences and historical pricing relationships 
the earnings of the company and the bank are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve system 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve system influence  to a significant extent  the overall growth of loans  investments and deposits  the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities  and interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are generally not predictable 
a key element in the company s ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of a net interest income nii simulation model 
this model is used to estimate the amount that nii will change over a one year time horizon under various interest rate scenarios 
these estimates are based on assumptions on the behavior of loan and deposit pricing  prepayment speeds on mortgage based assets  and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments 
the model s analytics include the effects of embedded options 
while such assumptions are inherently uncertain  management believes that these assumptions are reasonable 
as a result  the nii simulation model attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the balance sheet and provide a sophisticated estimate rather than a precise prediction of nii s exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company continues to be asset sensitive and  as a result  net interest income will generally increase from higher interest rates 
interest rate risk was reduced in by effectively matching asset and liability durations in response to a more stable interest rate outlook 
table presents  as of december   and  the estimate of the change in nii from a gradual basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  moving in parallel fashion for the entire yield curve  over the next month period relative to the measured base case scenario for nii 
market risk exposure to interest rate changes table december  interest rate change in basis points interest rate change in basis points interest rate change in basis points dollars in thousands estimated exposure as a percent of net interest income estimated exposure to net interest income    to enhance and complement the results from the nii simulation model  the company also monitors interest rate risk utilizing measures such as sensitivity of market value of equity  value at risk  and the exposure to basis risk and non parallel yield curve shifts 
there are inherent limitations to these measures  however  used along with the nii simulation model  the company obtains better overall insight for managing its exposure to changes in interest rates 
in managing interest rate risk  the company uses several approaches to modify its risk position 
approaches that are used to shift balance sheet mix or alter the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities include changing product pricing strategies  modifying investment securities portfolio characteristics  or using financial derivative instruments 
the use of financial derivatives  as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is incorporated by reference in this item  has generally been limited over the past several years 
liquidity management liquidity is managed in an effort to ensure that the company has continuous access to sufficient  reasonably priced funding 
funding requirements are impacted by loan refinancings and originations  liability settlements and issuances and off balance sheet funding commitments 
the company considers and complies with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitors its liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity 
based on periodic liquidity assessments  the company may alter its assets  liabilities and off balance sheet positions 
the alco monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process  combined with the company s ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements  provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk 
in an effort to ensure that its liquidity needs are met  the company actively manages its assets and liabilities 
the primary sources of liquidity are available for sale investment securities  interest bearing deposits and cash flows from loans and investments  as well as the ability to sell certain assets 
with respect to liabilities  liquidity is generated through growth in deposits  repos and other funding 
during  the company continued to use liquidity to repurchase stock see capital management and reduce debt where possible 
in  a total of million in federal home loan bank advances matured 
in addition  excess liquidity was deployed into longer term assets 
off balance sheet arrangements  commitments and aggregate contractual obligations the company does not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements

the company issues commercial paper in various denominations with maturities of generally days or less 
repos are financing transactions  under which securities are pledged as collateral for borrowings 
historically  these transactions were generally entered into with governmental entities  which have provided a stable source of funds via repos 
during  the company entered into several repo transactions with private parties for terms greater than one year 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank of seattle the fhlb  which provides an additional source for short and long term funding 
borrowings from the fhlb were million  at rates ranging from to  and million  at rates ranging from to  at the end of and  respectively 
additionally  the bank maintains a billion senior and subordinated bank note program 
under this facility  the bank may issue additional notes provided that the aggregate amount outstanding does not exceed billion 
subordinated notes outstanding under this bank note program totaled million bearing a fixed interest rate of at the end of and the largest purchase obligation included in the above table is an outsourcing agreement for technology services 
total payments over the remaining term through of this contract will be approximately million 
other contracts included in purchase obligations consist of service agreements for the company s asset management system  atm system and cash management system 
capital management the company and the bank are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures 
these measures were established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy 
at december  and  the company and the bank were well capitalized under this regulatory framework
