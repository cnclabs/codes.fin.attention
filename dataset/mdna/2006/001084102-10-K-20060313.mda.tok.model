in some cases these statements are identifiable through the use of words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  plan  project  target  can  could  may  should  will  would and similar expressions 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements we make are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various assumptions  risks  and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  those set forth below and in the other documents that we file with the sec 
there also are other factors that we may not describe  generally because we currently do not perceive them to be material  that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as required by law 
our financial results depend entirely upon the agricultural industry  and factors that adversely affect the agricultural industry generally will adversely affect us 
our success depends heavily on the vitality of the agricultural industry 
historically  the agricultural industry  including the agricultural equipment business  has been cyclical and subject to a variety of economic factors  governmental regulations and legislation  and weather conditions 
sales of agricultural equipment generally are related to the health of the agricultural industry  which is affected by farm income  debt levels and land values  all of which reflect levels of commodity prices  acreage planted  crop yields  demand  government policies and government subsidies 
sales also are influenced by economic conditions  interest rate and exchange rate levels  and the availability of retail financing 
trends in the industry  such as farm consolidations  may affect the agricultural equipment market 
in addition  weather conditions  such as heat waves or droughts  and pervasive livestock diseases can affect farmers buying decisions 
downturns in the agricultural industry due to these or other factors are likely to result in decreases in demand for agricultural equipment  which would adversely affect our sales  growth  results of operations and financial condition 
during previous downturns in the farm sector  we experienced significant and prolonged declines in sales and profitability  and we expect our business to remain subject to similar market fluctuations in the future 
the agricultural equipment industry is highly seasonal  and seasonal fluctuations significantly impact results of operations and cash flows 
the agricultural equipment business is highly seasonal  which causes our quarterly results and our available cash flow to fluctuate during the year 
december is also typically a large month for retail sales because of our customers tax planning considerations  the increase in availability of funds from completed harvests and the timing of dealer incentives 
in addition  farmers purchase agricultural equipment in the spring and fall in conjunction with the major planting and harvesting seasons 
our net sales and income from operations have historically been the lowest in the first quarter and have increased in subsequent quarters as dealers increase inventory in anticipation of increased retail sales in the third and fourth quarters 

table of contents our success depends on the introduction of new products  which requires substantial expenditures 
our long term results depend upon our ability to introduce and market new products successfully 
the success of our new products will depend on a number of factors  including customer acceptance  the efficiency of our suppliers in providing component parts  the economy  competition  and the strength of our dealer networks 
as both we and our competitors continuously introduce new products or refine versions of existing products  we cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share our new products will achieve 
any manufacturing delays or problems with our new product launches could adversely affect our operating results 
we have experienced delays in the introduction of new products in the past  and we cannot assure you that we will not experience delays in the future 
in addition  introducing new products could result in a decrease in revenues from our existing products 
consistent with our strategy of offering new products and product refinements  we expect to continue to use a substantial amount of capital for further product development and refinement 
we may need more capital for product development and refinement than is available to us  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face significant competition and  if we are unable to compete successfully against other agricultural equipment manufacturers  we would lose customers and our net sales and profitability would decline 
the agricultural equipment business is highly competitive  particularly in north america  europe and latin america 
we compete with several large national and international companies that  like us  offer a full line of agricultural equipment 
we also compete with numerous short line and specialty manufacturers and suppliers of farm equipment products 
our two key competitors  deere company and cnh global nv  are substantially larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources 
in addition  in some markets  we compete with smaller regional competitors with significant market share in a single country or group of countries 
our competitors may substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing  including discounting  of products that compete with our products 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other agricultural equipment manufacturers  we could lose customers and our net sales and profitability may decline 
there also can be no assurances that consumers will continue to regard our agricultural equipment favorably  and we may be unable to develop new products that appeal to consumers or unable to continue to compete successfully in the agricultural equipment business 
in addition  competitive pressures in the agricultural equipment business may affect the market prices of new and used equipment  which  in turn  may adversely affect our sales margins and results of operations 
rationalization of manufacturing facilities may cause production capacity constraints and inventory fluctuations 
the rationalization of our manufacturing facilities has at times resulted in  and similar rationalizations in the future may result in  temporary constraints upon our ability to produce the quantity of products necessary to fill orders and thereby complete sales in a timely manner 
a prolonged delay in our ability to fill orders on a timely basis could affect customer demand for our products and increase the size of our product inventories  causing future reductions in our manufacturing schedules and adversely affecting our results of operations 
moreover  our continuous development and production of new products will often involve the retooling of existing manufacturing facilities 
this retooling may limit our production capacity at certain times in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we depend on suppliers for raw materials  components and parts for our products  and any failure by our suppliers to provide products as needed  or by us to promptly address supplier issues  will adversely impact our ability to timely and efficiently manufacture and sell products 
we also are subject to raw material price fluctuations  which can adversely affect our manufacturing costs 
our products include components and parts manufactured by others 
as a result  our ability to timely and efficiently manufacture existing products  to introduce new products and to shift manufacturing of products from one facility to another depends on the quality of these components and parts and the timeliness of their delivery to our facilities 
at any particular time  we depend on many different suppliers  and the failure by one or more of our suppliers to perform as needed will result in fewer products being manufactured  shipped and sold 
if the quality of the components or parts provided by our suppliers is less than required and we do not recognize that failure prior to the shipment of our products  we will incur higher warranty costs 
the timely supply of component parts for our products also depends on our ability to manage our relationships with suppliers  to identify and replace suppliers that fail to meet our schedules or quality standards  and to monitor the flow of components and accurately project our needs 
a significant increase in the price of any component or raw material could adversely affect our profitability 
we cannot avoid exposure to global price fluctuations  such as occurred in with the costs of steel and related products  and our profitability depends on  among other things  our ability to raise equipment and parts prices sufficiently enough to recover any such material or component cost increases 
a majority of our sales and manufacturing take place outside the united states  and  as a result  we are exposed to risks related to foreign laws  taxes  economic conditions  labor supply and relations  political conditions and governmental policies 
these risks may delay or reduce our realization of value from our international operations 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately billion or of our net sales from sales outside the united states 
the primary foreign countries in which we do business are germany  france  brazil  the united kingdom and finland 
in addition  we have significant manufacturing operations in france  germany  brazil  finland and denmark 
our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by the laws  taxes  economic conditions  labor supply and relations  political conditions and governmental policies of the foreign countries in which we conduct business 
some of our international operations also are subject to various risks that are not present in domestic operations  including restrictions on dividends and the repatriation of funds 
foreign developing markets may present special risks  such as unavailability of financing  inflation  slow economic growth and price controls 
domestic and foreign political developments and government regulations and policies directly affect the international agricultural industry  which affects the demand for agricultural equipment 
if demand for agricultural equipment declines  our sales  growth  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
the application  modification or adoption of laws  regulations  trade agreements or policies adversely affecting the agricultural industry  including the imposition of import and export duties and quotas  expropriation and potentially burdensome taxation  could have an adverse effect on our business 
the ability of our international customers to operate their businesses and the health of the agricultural industry  in general  are affected by domestic and foreign government programs that provide economic support to farmers 
as a result  farm income levels and the ability of farmers to obtain advantageous financing and other protections would be reduced to the extent that any such programs are curtailed or eliminated 
any such reductions would likely result in a decrease in demand for agricultural equipment 
for example  a decrease or elimination of current price protections for commodities or of subsidy payments for farmers in the european union  the united states  brazil or elsewhere in south america could negatively impact the operations of farmers in those regions  and  as a result  our sales may decline if these farmers delay  reduce or cancel purchases of our products 

table of contents currency exchange rate and interest rate changes can adversely affect the pricing and profitability of our products 
we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies 
our production costs  profit margins and competitive position are affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we manufacture or purchase goods relative to the strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold 
in addition  we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues and to risks associated with translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into united states dollars 
similarly  changes in interest rates affect our results of operations by increasing or decreasing borrowing costs and finance income 
our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the euro  brazilian real and the canadian dollar in relation to the united states dollar 
where naturally offsetting currency positions do not occur  we attempt to manage these risks by economically hedging some  but not all  of our exposures through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
as with all hedging instruments  there are risks associated with the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts  interest rate swap agreements and other risk management contracts 
while the use of such hedging instruments provides us with protection from certain fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates  we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange and interest rates 
in addition  any default by the counterparties to these transactions could adversely affect us 
despite our use of economic hedging transactions  currency exchange rate or interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow or financial condition 
we are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations  and our compliance with  or our failure to comply with  existing or future laws and regulations could delay production of our products or otherwise adversely affect our business 
we are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate 
these regulations govern  among other things  emissions into the air  discharges into water  the use  handling and disposal of hazardous substances  waste disposal and the remediation of soil and groundwater contamination 
our costs of complying with these or any other current or future environmental regulations may be significant 
for example  the european union and the united states have adopted more stringent environmental regulations regarding emissions into the air 
as a result  we will likely incur increased capital expenses to modify our products to comply with these regulations 
further  we may experience production delays if we or our suppliers are unable to design and manufacture components for our products that comply with environmental standards established by regulators 
for example  our sisudiesel engine division and our engine suppliers are subject to air quality standards  and production at our facilities could be impaired if sisudiesel and these suppliers are unable to timely respond to any changes in environmental laws and regulations affecting engine emissions 
compliance with environmental and safety regulations has added  and will continue to add  to the cost of our products and increase the capital intensive nature of our business 
we may be adversely impacted by costs  liabilities or claims with respect to our operations under existing laws or those that may be adopted in the future 
if we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations  we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our labor force is heavily unionized  and our contractual and legal obligations under collective bargaining agreements and labor laws subject us to the risks of work interruption or stoppage and could cause our costs to be higher 
most of our employees  most notably at our manufacturing facilities  are represented by collective bargaining agreements and union contracts with terms that expire on varying dates 
several of our collective bargaining agreements and union contracts are of limited duration and  therefore  must be re negotiated frequently 
as a result  we could incur significant administrative expenses associated with union representation of our employees 
furthermore  we are at greater risk of work interruptions or stoppages than non unionized companies  and any work interruption or stoppage could significantly impact the volume of goods we 
table of contents have available for sale 
in addition  collective bargaining agreements  union contracts and labor laws may impair our ability to reduce our labor costs by streamlining existing manufacturing facilities and in restructuring our business because of limitations on personnel and salary changes and similar restrictions 
we have significant pension obligations with respect to our employees and our available cash flow may be adversely affected in the event that payments became due under any pension plans that are unfunded or underfunded 
a portion of our active and retired employees participate in defined benefit pension plans under which we are obligated to provide prescribed levels of benefits regardless of the value of the underlying assets  if any  of the applicable pension plan 
if our obligations under a plan are unfunded or underfunded  we will have to use cash flow from operations and other sources to pay our obligations either as they become due or over some shorter funding period 
as of december   we had approximately million in unfunded or underfunded obligations related to our pension and other postretirement health care benefits 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness  and  as a result  we are subject to certain restrictive covenants and payment obligations that may adversely affect our ability to operate and expand our business 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of december   we had total long term indebtedness  including current portions of long term indebtedness  of approximately million  stockholders equity of approximately  million and a ratio of long term indebtedness to equity of approximately to we also had short term obligations of million  capital lease obligations of million  unconditional purchase or other long term obligations of million  and amounts funded under an accounts receivable securitization facility of million 
in addition  we had guaranteed indebtedness owed to third parties of approximately million  primarily related to dealer and end user financing of equipment 
our substantial indebtedness could have important adverse consequences 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  restrict us from introducing new products or pursuing business opportunities  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have relatively less indebtedness  limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds  pay cash dividends or engage in or enter into certain transactions  and prevent us from selling additional receivables to our commercial paper conduit 
the european facility agreement provides that the agent  rabobank  has the right to terminate the securitization facilities if our senior unsecured debt rating moves below b by standard poor s or b by moody s investor services 
based on our current ratings  a downgrade of two levels by standard poors and moody s would need to occur

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a leading manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts throughout the world 
we sell a full range of agricultural equipment  including tractors  combines  hay tools  sprayers  forage equipment and implements and a line of diesel engines 
our products are widely recognized in the agricultural equipment industry and are marketed under a number of well known brand names  including agco  challenger  fendt  gleaner  hesston  massey ferguson  new idea  rogator  spra coupe  sunflower  terra gator  valtra  and white tm planters 
we distribute most of our products through a combination of approximately  independent dealers  distributors  associates and licensees 
in addition  we provide retail financing in the united states  canada  brazil  germany  france  the united kingdom  australia and ireland through our finance joint ventures with rabobank 
results of operations we sell our equipment and replacement parts to our independent dealers  distributors and other customers 
a large majority of our sales are to independent dealers and distributors that sell our products to the end user 
to the extent practicable  we attempt to sell products to our dealers and distributors on a level basis throughout the year to reduce the effect of seasonal demands on our manufacturing operations and to minimize our investment in inventory 
however  retail sales by dealers to farmers are highly seasonal and are linked to the planting and harvesting seasons 
in certain markets  particularly in north america  there is often a time lag  which varies based on the timing and level of retail demand  between our sale of the equipment to the dealer and the dealer s sale to a retail customer

these declines were partially offset by improved margins in the europe africa middle east region  which were positively impacted by improved productivity  new product introductions  expense control measures and pricing changes 
productivity improvements were achieved through purchasing and material cost initiatives  outsourcing initiatives  such as the outsourcing of combine manufacturing in europe  and enhanced production processes  resulting in material flow and assembly improvements 
margins in north america were impacted by the weak united states dollar on products imported from our european and brazilian facilities and higher warranty costs

the restructuring and other infrequent expenses in primarily related to the rationalization of our randers  denmark combine manufacturing operations announced in july during the second quarter of  we completed auctions of remaining machinery and equipment at the randers facility and recorded a gain associated with such actions 
the gain was offset by restructuring expenses associated with the randers rationalization  consisting primarily of employee retention payments and other facility closure costs 
we also recorded restructuring expenses during associated with severance costs  retention payments  asset write downs and contract termination costs related to the rationalization of our finnish tractor manufacturing  parts distribution and sales operations 
the restructuring expenses in primarily related to charges incurred resulting from the randers rationalization  as well as costs associated with various rationalization initiatives in europe and the united states  offset by gains on the sale of property  plant and equipment related to our coventry  england facility closure  as well as a revision to a previously established provision  which resulted in the reduction in the estimated costs associated with our pension plan in the united kingdom

statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we assessed the likelihood that our deferred tax assets would be recovered from estimated future taxable income and available income tax planning strategies and determined that an adjustment to the valuation allowance was appropriate 
the effective tax rate excluding the non cash deferred income tax charge was for compared to during in both years  our effective tax rate was negatively impacted by incurring losses in tax jurisdictions where we recorded no tax benefit 
the most significant impact related to losses incurred in the united states in and denmark in in  we incurred losses in the united states  in part  due to costs associated with the second quarter redemption of our senior notes  as discussed above  as well as lower operating margins as previously described 
in  we incurred losses in denmark primarily due to the rationalization of our combine manufacturing operations in randers  denmark

gross margins improved in primarily due to increased production and improved productivity 
in particular  improved productivity and supply chain performance in our beauvais  france manufacturing operations contributed to higher margins 
these positive factors were offset by lower margins in north america due to the impact of the weak united states dollar on products exported from our european and brazilian facilities

valtra european sales office rationalizations during the second quarter of  we announced a change in our distribution of our valtra and fendt products in scandinavia by entering into a distribution agreement with a third party distributor to distribute valtra and fendt equipment in sweden and valtra equipment in norway and denmark 
as a result of this agreement and the decision to close other valtra european sales offices  we initiated the restructuring and closure of our valtra sales offices located in the united kingdom  spain  denmark and norway  resulting in the termination of approximately employees 
the danish and norwegian sales operations were transferred to the third party scandinavian equipment distributor in october  which included the transfer of certain employees  assets and lease and supplier contracts

these rationalizations are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
randers  denmark rationalization in july  we announced and initiated a plan to restructure our european combine manufacturing operations located in randers  denmark 
the restructuring plan will reduce the cost and complexity of the randers manufacturing operation by simplifying the model range and eliminating the facility s component manufacturing operations 
component manufacturing operations ceased in february we now outsource manufacturing of the majority of parts and components to suppliers and have retained critical key assembly operations at the randers facility 
by retaining only the facility assembly operations  we reduced the randers workforce by employees and permanently eliminated of the square footage utilized 
our plans also included a rationalization of the combine model range assembled in randers  retaining the production of the high specification  high value combines 
we estimate that the restructuring plan will generate annual savings of approximately million to million by  with achieved savings in of approximately million 
these savings will primarily impact cost of goods sold 
total cash restructuring costs were approximately million 
during  we recorded an million write down of property  plant and equipment  as well as million of severance costs  employee retention payments and facility closure costs 
we also recorded approximately million of inventory write downs during  reflected in costs of goods sold  related to inventory that was identified as obsolete as a result of the restructuring plan 
during  we recorded an additional million of restructuring costs related to the rationalization  primarily related to employee retention payments and other facility closure costs 
during the second quarter of  we completed auctions of remaining machinery and equipment and recorded a gain of approximately million associated with such actions 
the gain was reflected in restructuring and other infrequent expenses within our consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   all of the employees had been terminated 
the components of the restructuring expenses incurred during and are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
coventry rationalization during  we announced and initiated a restructuring plan related to the closure of our tractor manufacturing facility in coventry  england and the relocation of existing production at coventry to our beauvais  france and canoas  brazil manufacturing facilities  resulting in the termination of  employees 
the closure of this facility was consistent with our strategy to reduce excess manufacturing capacity 
in  we completed the transfer of production to our beauvais facility  although we experienced cost inefficiencies and production delays primarily due to supplier delivery issues 
those issues were largely corrected in we estimate that we have reduced manufacturing overhead costs as a result of the coventry rationalization project by approximately million when adjusted for changes in production volume from year to year 
approximately million of restructuring and other infrequent expenses were recorded associated with this rationalization during  primarily related to employee retention payments 
during  we recorded a gain of million on the sale of our coventry  england facility  as well as gains totaling approximately million related to the sale of machinery and equipment at the coventry facility and certain coventry closure reserve reductions 
during  we also recorded a million reversal of a previously established 
table of contents provision related to our pension plan in the united kingdom 
the components of the restructuring expenses incurred related to the coventry rationalization are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in october  we applied to the high court in london  england  for clarification of a provision in our uk pension plan that governs the value of pension payments payable to an employee who is over years old and who retires from service in certain circumstances prior to his normal retirement date 
the primary matter before the high court was whether pension payments to such employees  including those who take early retirement and those terminated due to the closure of our coventry facility  should be reduced to compensate for the fact that the pension payments begin prior to a normal retirement age of in july  a uk court of appeal ruled that employees terminated as a result of the closure of the coventry facility do not qualify for full pensions  but ruled that other employees might qualify 
as a result of the ruling in that case  certain employees who took early retirement in prior years under voluntary retirement arrangements would be entitled to additional payments  and therefore we recorded a charge in the second quarter of  included in restructuring and other infrequent expenses  of approximately million or approximately million to reflect our estimate of the additional pension liability associated with previous early retirement programs 
subsequently  as full details of the court of appeal judgment were published  we received more detailed legal advice regarding the specific circumstances in which the past voluntary retirements would be subject to the court s ruling 
based on this advice  we completed a detailed review of past terminations during the fourth quarter of  and concluded that the number of former employees who are considered to be eligible to receive enhanced pensions under the court s ruling was lower than our initial estimate 
we therefore recorded a reversal of the established provision of approximately million or approximately million during the fourth quarter of  which was included in restructuring and other infrequent expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
dekalb rationalization in march  we announced the closure of our challenger track tractor facility located in dekalb  illinois and the relocation of production to our facility in jackson  minnesota 
production at the dekalb facility ceased in may and was relocated and resumed in the minnesota facility in june the dekalb plant assembled challenger track tractors in the range of to horsepower 
after a review of cost reduction alternatives  it was determined that current and future production levels at that time were not sufficient to support a stand alone track tractor site 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we recorded approximately million of restructuring and other infrequent expenses during  which included the termination of approximately employees 
we estimate that we have reduced costs by approximately million as a result of the closure 
we sold the dekalb facility real estate during the fourth quarter of for approximately million before associated selling costs  and recorded a net loss on the sale of the facilities of approximately million 
the loss was reflected in restructuring and other infrequent expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
the components of the restructuring expenses incurred during are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
 and functional rationalizations in addition  during through  we initiated several rationalization plans and recorded restructuring and other infrequent expenses which in aggregate totaled approximately million during  and the expenses primarily related to severance costs and certain lease termination and other exit costs associated with the rationalization of our european engineering and marketing personnel  the rationalization of certain components of our german manufacturing facilities located in kempten and marktoberdorf  germany  the rationalization of our european combine engineering operations and the closure and consolidation of our valtra united states and canadian sales organizations 
these rationalizations were completed to improve our ongoing cost structure and to reduce cost of goods sold  as well as engineering and sg a expenses 
these expenses are discussed more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in the preparation of these financial statements  we make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements are detailed in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our application of the policies discussed below involves significant levels of judgments  estimates and complexity 
allowance for doubtful accounts we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by actively monitoring the financial condition of our customers to determine the potential for any nonpayment of trade receivables 
in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  we also consider other economic factors  such as aging trends 
we believe that our process of specific review of customers combined with overall analytical review provides an effective evaluation of ultimate collectibility of trade receivables 
our loss experience was approximately of net sales in discount and sales incentive allowances allowances for discounts and sales incentives are made at the time of sale based on retail sales incentive programs available to the dealer or retail customer 
the cost of these programs depends on various factors including the timing of the retail sale and the programs in place at that time 
these retail sales incentives may also be revised between the time we record the sale and the time the retail sale occurs 
we monitor these factors and revise our provisions when necessary 
at december   we had recorded an allowance for discounts and sales incentives of approximately million 
if we were to allow an additional of sales incentives and discounts at the time of retail sale  our reserve would increase by approximately million as of december  conversely  if we were to decrease our sales incentives and discounts by at the time of retail sale  our reserve would decrease by approximately million as of december  inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
determination of cost includes estimates for surplus and obsolete inventory based on estimates of future sales and production 
changes in demand and product design can impact these estimates 
we periodically evaluate and update our assumptions when assessing the adequacy of inventory adjustments 
deferred income taxes we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we estimate it is more likely than not that the tax assets will not be realized 
we base these estimates on projections of future income  including tax planning strategies  in certain tax jurisdictions 
changes in industry conditions and the competitive environment may impact the accuracy of our projections 
sfas no 
requires the establishment of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we periodically assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from estimated future taxable income and available tax planning strategies and determine if adjustments to the valuation allowance are appropriate 
as a result of these assessments  there are certain tax jurisdictions where we do not benefit further losses 
we have not benefited losses generated in the united states in  and or with respect to the losses incurred in denmark in during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a non cash deferred income tax charge of million related to increasing the valuation allowance against our united states deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we assessed the likelihood that our united states deferred tax assets would be recovered from future taxable income and determined that an adjustment to the valuation allowance was appropriate 
at december  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  
table of contents respectively  including million and million  respectively  related to net operating loss carryforwards 
at december  and  we had recorded total valuation allowances as an offset to the gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively  primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards in argentina  brazil  denmark  and the united states 
realization of the remaining deferred tax assets as of december  depends on generating sufficient taxable income in future periods  net of reversing deferred tax liabilities 
we believe it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
warranty and additional service actions we make provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties at the time products are sold 
we base these estimates on historical experience of the nature  frequency and average cost of warranty claims 
in addition  the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved  and policies related to additional service actions  are taken into consideration 
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors  changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income 
our estimate of warranty obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis 
experience has shown that initial data for any product series line can be volatile  therefore  our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data is available 
as actual experience becomes available  it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties 
insurance reserves we provide insurance reserves for our estimates of losses due to claims for worker s compensation  product liability and other liabilities for which we are self insured 
we base these estimates on the ultimate settlement amount of claims  which often have long periods of resolution 
we closely monitor the claims to maintain adequate reserves 
pensions we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees principally in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  finland  norway  france  australia and argentina 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 
nature of estimates required the measurement of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries as provided by management 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
assumptions and approach used the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates we base the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our us pension plans on the moody s investor service aa bond yield as of december of each year 
for our non us plans  we base the discount rate on comparable indices within each of those countries  such as the year iboxx aa corporate bond yield in the united kingdom 
the indices used in the united states  the united kingdom and 
table of contents other countries were chosen to match our expected plan obligations and related expected cash flows 
the measurement date with respect to our uk pension plan is september of each year 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the expected return on plan assets assumptions reflects asset allocations  investment strategy  historical experience and the views of investment managers 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such periods 
our us and us pension plans represent approximately of our consolidated projected benefit obligation as of december  if the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our us plans was decreased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately million at december   and our pension expense would increase by a nominal amount 
if the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our us plans was increased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately million  and our pension expense would decrease by a nominal amount 
if the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our uk plan was decreased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately million at december   and our pension expense would increase by approximately million 
if the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our uk plan was increased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately million at december   and our pension expense would decrease by approximately million 
unrecognized actuarial losses related to our pension plans were million as of december  as compared to million as of december  the increase in unrecognized losses between years primarily reflects declining discount rates worldwide  partially offset by gains as a result of better than expected asset returns and favorable currency translation 
the unrecognized actuarial losses will be impacted in future periods by actual asset returns  discount rate changes  currency exchange rate fluctuations  actual demographic experience and certain other factors 
these losses will be amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under most of our defined benefit pension plans 
for some plans  the population covered is predominantly inactive participants  and losses related to those plans will be amortized over the average remaining lifetimes of those participants while covered by the respective plan 
as of december   the average amortization period was years for our us pension plans  and years for our us pension plans 
we expect our amortization of net actuarial losses to increase approximately million in as compared to  primarily due to the decrease in discount rates

table of contents the weighted average asset allocation of our non us pension benefit plans at december  and are as follows asset category equity securities fixed income securities other investments total all tax qualified pension fund investments in the united states are held in the agco corporation master pension trust 
our global pension fund strategy is to diversify investments across broad categories of equity and fixed income securities with appropriate use of alternative investment categories to minimize risk and volatility 
our us target allocation of retirement fund investments is large cap domestic equity securities  international equity securities  domestic fixed income securities  and invested in other investments 
we have noted that over very long periods  this mix of investments would achieve an average return in excess of 
in arriving at the choice of an expected return assumption of for our us based plans  we have tempered this historical indicator with lower expectations for returns on equity investments in the future  as well as considered administrative costs of the plans 
to date  we have not invested pension funds in our own stock  and we have no intention of doing so in the future 
our non us target allocation of retirement fund investments is equity securities  fixed income securities and percent invested in other investments 
the majority of our non us pension fund investments are related to our pension plan in the united kingdom 
we have noted that over very long periods  this target mix of investments would achieve an average return in excess of 
in arriving at the choice of an expected return assumption of for our uk pension plan  we have tempered this historical indicator with a slightly lower expectation of future returns on equity investments 
as of december   we had approximately million in unfunded or underfunded obligations related to our pension plans  due primarily to our pension plans in the united states and the united kingdom 
in  we contributed approximately million towards those obligations  and we expect to fund at least approximately million in future funding is dependent upon compliance with local laws and regulations and changes to those laws and regulations in the future  as well as the generation of operating cash flows in the future 
we currently have an agreement in place with the trustees of the uk defined benefit plan  which obligates us to fund approximately to million per year or approximately to million towards that obligation for the next years 
the funding arrangement is based upon the current underfunded status and could change in the future as discount rates  local laws and regulations and other factors change 
other postretirement benefits retiree health care and life insurance we provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for certain employees principally in the united states 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for other postretirement benefits 
nature of estimates required 
the measurement of our obligations  costs and liabilities associated with other postretirement benefits  such as retiree health care and life insurance  requires that we make use of estimates of the present value of the projected future payments to all participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as health care cost increases  salary increases and demographic experience  which may have an effect on the amount and timing of future payments 

table of contents assumptions and approach used 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors health care cost trends inflation discount rates expected return on plan assets salary growth mortality rates retirement rates our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook  efficiencies and other cost mitigating actions including further employee cost sharing  administrative improvements and other efficiencies and an assessment of likely long term trends 
we base the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our us postretirement benefit plans on the moody s investor service aa bond yield as of december of each year 
the index used was chosen to match our expected plan obligations and related expected cash flows 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience

if the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation for our us postretirement benefit plans was increased by basis points  our projected benefit obligation would have decreased by approximately million  and our pension expense would decrease by a nominal amount 
unrecognized actuarial losses related to our us postretirement benefit plans were million as of december  compared to million as of december  the decrease in losses primarily reflects the impact of the federal medicare subsidy under the medicare modernization act of  as well as changes made to some of our retiree welfare programs during and  but was partially offset by the reduction in the discount rate 
the unrecognized actuarial losses will be impacted in future periods by discount rate changes  actual demographic experience  actual health care inflation and certain other factors 
these losses will be amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits  or the average remaining lifetime of inactive participants  covered under the postretirement benefit plans 
as of december   the average amortization period was years for our us postretirement benefit plans 
we expect our amortization of net actuarial losses to decrease approximately million in as compared to  primarily due to the federal subsidy benefits and changes made to the postretirement programs 
for measuring the expected postretirement benefit obligation at december   a health care cost trend rate was assumed for  decreasing per year to and remaining at that level thereafter 
changing the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point each year and holding all other assumptions constant would have the following effect to service and interest cost for and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  in millions one one percentage percentage point point increase decrease effect on service and interest cost effect on accumulated benefit obligation 
table of contents litigation we are party to various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business 
we closely monitor these claims and lawsuits and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether or not they may  when resolved  have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 establishes a method of testing goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
our initial assessment and our annual assessments involve determining an estimate of the fair value of our reporting units in order to evaluate whether an impairment of the current carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets exists 
fair values are derived based on an evaluation of past and expected future performance of our reporting units 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment eg  a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and our executive management team regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
in addition  we combine and aggregate two or more components of an operating segment as a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics 
our reportable segments reported under the guidance of sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  are not our reporting units  with the exception of our asia pacific geographical segment 
we utilized a combination of valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow approach  a market multiple approach and a comparable transaction approach when making our initial and subsequent annual and interim assessments 
as stated above  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if indications of impairment exist 
the results of our analyses conducted as of october   and indicated that no reduction in the carrying amount of goodwill was required 
due to the level of judgment  complexity and period of time over which many of these items are resolved  actual results could differ from those estimated at the time of preparation of the financial statements 
adjustments to these estimates would impact our financial position and future results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our financing requirements are subject to variations due to seasonal changes in inventory and receivable levels 
internally generated funds are supplemented when necessary from external sources  primarily our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facilities 
our current financing and funding sources  with balances outstanding as of december   are our million principal amount convertible senior subordinated notes due  million or approximately million principal amount senior subordinated notes due  approximately million of accounts receivable securitization facilities  a million multi currency revolving credit facility  a million term loan facility and a million or approximately million term loan facility 
on december   we sold million of convertible senior subordinated notes due under a private placement offering 
the notes were unsecured obligations and were convertible into shares of our common stock upon satisfaction of certain conditions  as discussed below 
interest is payable on the notes at per annum  payable semi annually in arrears in cash on june and december of each year 
the notes were convertible into shares of our common stock at an effective price of per share  subject to adjustment 
on june   we exchanged the notes for new notes which provide for i the settlement upon conversion in cash up to the principal amount of the converted new notes with any excess conversion value settled in shares of our common stock  and ii the conversion rate to be increased under certain circumstances if the new notes are converted in connection with certain change of control transactions occurring prior to december   but otherwise are substantially the same as the old notes 
holders may 
table of contents convert the notes only under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter  if the closing sales price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business day period after a five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of that period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate  if the notes have been called for redemption  or upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions 
beginning january   we may redeem any of the notes at a redemption price of of their principal amount  plus accrued interest 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes at a repurchase price of of their principal amount  plus accrued interest  on december     and the impact of the exchange completed in june  as discussed above  will be to reduce the diluted weighted average shares outstanding in future periods 
the initial reduction in the diluted shares was approximately million shares but will vary in the future based on our stock price  once the market price trigger or other specified conversion circumstances have been met 
although we do not currently have in place a financial facility with which to pay the cash amount due upon maturity or conversion of the new notes  our financial position currently is sufficiently strong enough that we would expect to have ready access to a bank loan facility or the broader debt and equity markets to the extent needed 
typically  convertible securities are not converted prior to expiration unless called for redemption  which we would not do if sufficient funds were not available to us 
as a result  we do not expect the new notes to be converted in the foreseeable future 
on january   we entered into a new credit facility that provides for a million multi currency revolving credit facility  a million united states dollar denominated term loan and a million euro denominated term loan 
the maturity date of the revolving credit facility was automatically extended from march to december due to the redemption of our senior notes on june  we were required to prepay approximately million of the united states dollar denominated term loan and million of the euro denominated term loan as a result of excess proceeds received from our common stock public offering in april we are required to make quarterly payments towards the united states dollar denominated term loan and euro denominated term loan of million and million  respectively or an amortization of one percent per annum until the maturity date of each term loan 
the maturity date for the term loans was automatically extended from march to june due to the redemption of our senior notes on june  the revolving credit and term loan facilities are secured by a majority of our us  canadian  finnish and us based assets and a pledge of a portion of the stock of our domestic and material foreign subsidiaries 
interest accrues on amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility  at our option  at either libor plus a margin ranging between and based upon our senior debt ratio or the higher of the administrative agent s base lending rate or one half of one percent over the federal funds rate plus a margin ranging between and based on our senior debt ratio 
interest accrues on amounts outstanding under the term loans at libor plus 
the credit facility contains covenants restricting  among other things  the incurrence of indebtedness and the making of certain payments  including dividends 
we also must fulfill financial covenants including  among others  a total debt to ebitda ratio  a senior debt to ebitda ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the facility 
as of december   we had total borrowings of million under the credit facility  which included million under the united states dollar denominated term loan facility and million approximately million under the euro denominated term loan facility 
as of december   we had availability to borrow million under the revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had total borrowings of million under the credit facility  which included million under the united states dollar denominated term loan facility and million approximately million under the euro denominated term loan facility 
as of december   we had availability to borrow million under the revolving credit facility 
on march   we amended the term loan agreements to  among other reasons  lower the borrowing rate by basis points from libor plus to libor plus 
on april   we sold  shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the net proceeds to repay a million 
table of contents interim bridge loan facility that we used in part to acquire valtra  to repay borrowings under our credit facility and to pay offering related fees and expenses 
on april   we sold million of senior subordinated notes due and received proceeds of approximately million  after offering related fees and expenses 
the senior subordinated notes are unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to any existing or future senior indebtedness 
interest is payable on the notes semi annually on april and october of each year  beginning october  beginning april   we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  initially at of their principal amount  plus accrued interest  declining to of their principal amount  plus accrued interest  at any time on or after april  in addition  before april   we may redeem the notes  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued interest and a make whole premium 
before april   we also may redeem up to of the notes at of their principal amount using the proceeds from sales of certain kinds of capital stock 
the notes include covenants restricting the incurrence of indebtedness and the making of certain restricted payments  including dividends 
we used the net proceeds received from the issuance of the senior subordinated notes  as well as available cash  to redeem our million principal amount of senior subordinated notes on may  we redeemed our million senior notes on june  at a price of approximately million  which represented a premium of over the senior notes face amount 
the premium of approximately million was reflected in interest expense  net during the second quarter of in connection with the redemption  we also wrote off the remaining balance of deferred debt issuance costs of approximately million 
the funding sources for the redemption was a combination of cash generated from the transfer of wholesale interest bearing receivables to our united states and canadian retail finance joint ventures  agco finance llc and agco finance canada  ltd 
as discussed further below  revolving credit facility borrowings and available cash on hand 
under our securitization facilities  we sell accounts receivable in the united states  canada and europe on a revolving basis to commercial paper conduits either on a direct basis or through a wholly owned special purpose entity 
the united states and canadian securitization facilities expire in april and the european facility expires in june  but each is subject to annual renewal 
as of december   the aggregate amount of these facilities was million 
the outstanding funded balance of million as of december  has the effect of reducing accounts receivable and short term liabilities by the same amount 
our risk of loss under the securitization facilities is limited to a portion of the unfunded balance of receivables sold  which is approximately of the funded amount 
we maintain reserves for doubtful accounts associated with this risk 
if the facilities were terminated  we would not be required to repurchase previously sold receivables but would be prevented from selling additional receivables to the commercial paper conduit 
the european facility agreement provides that the agent  rabobank  has the right to terminate the securitization facilities if our senior unsecured debt rating moves below b by standard poor s or b by moody s investor services 
based on our current ratings  a downgrade of two levels by standard poor s or two levels by moody s would need to occur 
we are currently in discussions with the conduit purchaser to eliminate the requirement to maintain certain debt rating levels from standard and poor s and moody s investors service from the agreement and to extend the european facility through june these facilities allow us to sell accounts receivables through financing conduits which obtain funding from commercial paper markets 
future funding under securitization facilities depends upon the adequacy of receivables  a sufficient demand for the underlying commercial paper and the maintenance of certain covenants concerning the quality of the receivables and our financial condition 
in the event commercial paper demand is not adequate  our securitization facilities provide for liquidity backing from various financial institutions  including rabobank 
these liquidity commitments would provide us with interim funding to allow us to find alternative sources of working capital financing  if necessary 
in may  we completed an agreement to permit transferring  on an ongoing basis  the majority of our wholesale interest bearing receivables in north america to our united states and canadian retail finance 
table of contents joint ventures  agco finance llc and agco finance canada  ltd 
we have a ownership interest in these joint ventures 
the transfer of the wholesale interest bearing receivables is without recourse to agco and we will continue to service the receivables 
the initial transfer of wholesale interest bearing receivables resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  which were used to redeem our million senior notes 
as of december   the balance of interest bearing receivables transferred to agco finance llc and agco finance canada  ltd 
under this agreement was approximately million 
our business is subject to substantial cyclical variations  which generally are difficult to forecast 
our results of operations may also vary from time to time resulting from costs associated with rationalization plans and acquisitions 
as a result  we have had to request relief from our lenders on occasion with respect to financial covenant compliance 
while we do not currently anticipate asking for any relief  it is possible that we would require relief in the future 
based upon our historical working relationship with our lenders  we currently do not anticipate any difficulty in obtaining that relief 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million during  compared to million during the operating cash flows during reflects approximately million of interest bearing receivables that were transferred to agco finance llc and agco finance canada ltd  our retail finance joint ventures in north america  as discussed above 
excluding this impact  operating cash flows in was lower than due to lower net income and increases in working capital 
our working capital requirements are seasonal  with investments in working capital typically building in the first half of the year and then reducing in the second half of the year 
we had million in working capital at december   as compared with  million at december  accounts receivable and inventories  combined  at december  were million lower than at december  production levels were significantly lower than the prior year during the fourth quarter of as a result of our initiative to reduce inventory levels by the end of the year 
in addition  cash on hand at december  was lower compared to december  as cash was used to fund inventory needs  as well as the repayment of our million senior notes  as discussed above 
production levels for are expected to be to below to reflect the decline in industry demand and our inventory reduction goals 
the timing of production has been reduced in the first half of  which is expected to reduce our seasonal increase in working capital during capital expenditures for were million compared to million during capital expenditures during were used to support the development and enhancement of new and existing products  as well as to expand our engine manufacturing facility 
in february  we made a million investment in our retail finance joint venture with rabobank in brazil  as more fully described in related parties below 
our debt to capitalization ratio  which is total long term debt divided by the sum of total long term debt and stockholders equity  was at december  compared to at december  the decrease is due to lower debt levels in  primarily due to the redemption of our million senior notes in june from time to time  we review and will continue to review acquisition and joint venture opportunities  as well as changes in the capital markets 
if we were to consummate a significant acquisition or elect to take advantage of favorable opportunities in the capital markets  we may supplement availability or revise the terms under our credit facilities or complete public or private offerings of equity or debt securities 
we believe that available borrowings under the revolving credit facility  funding under the accounts receivable securitization facilities  available cash and internally generated funds will be sufficient to support our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future

outlook our operations are subject to the cyclical nature of the agricultural industry 
sales of our equipment have been and are expected to continue to be affected by changes in net cash farm income  farm land values  weather conditions  the demand for agricultural commodities  farm industry related legislation and general economic conditions 
worldwide industry conditions for retail sales of agricultural equipment are expected to be modestly below levels 
in north america  record farm income from the previous two years should support demand at relatively high levels in however  higher fuel and fertilizer input costs and lower crop prices are expected to negatively impact farm income and equipment demand compared to in europe  equipment demand is expected to continue to decline in resulting from lower commodity prices  higher input costs and concerns over subsidy reforms 
in south america  equipment demand is expected to remain at low levels due to the impact of the strong brazilian real  high farm debt levels and drought conditions in argentina 
based on this market outlook  net sales for the full year of are expected to be slightly below resulting from lower industry demand  planned dealer inventory reductions and currency translation  partially offset by pricing increases and market share improvements 
operating margins are targeted to improve in due to the achievement of further cost reduction and productivity initiatives 
results will also be impacted by lower interest costs due to lower debt levels 
we also are targeting improvements in working capital utilization in by lowering seasonal increases in dealer and company inventories throughout through the leveling of production and dealer deliveries compared to foreign currency risk management we have significant manufacturing operations in france  germany  brazil  finland and denmark  and we purchase a portion of our tractors  combines and components from third party foreign suppliers  primarily in various european countries and in japan

see note to our consolidated financial statements for net sales by customer location 
our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the euro  brazilian real and the canadian dollar in relation to the united states dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect our results of operations 
we attempt to manage our transactional foreign exchange exposure by economically hedging foreign currency cash flow forecasts and commitments arising from the settlement of receivables and payables and from future purchases and sales 
where naturally offsetting currency positions do not occur  we hedge certain  but not all  of our exposures through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
our hedging policy prohibits foreign currency forward contracts for speculative trading purposes 
our translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries into united states dollars is not hedged 
our most significant translation exposures are the euro  the british pound and the brazilian real in

when practical  this translation impact is reduced by financing local operations with local borrowings 
all derivatives are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into  we designate the derivative as either a fair value hedge of a recognized liability  a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction  a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation  or a non designated derivative instrument 
we have engaged in the past and currently engage in derivatives that are non designated derivative instruments 
changes in fair value of non designated derivative contracts are reported in current earnings 
the following is a summary of foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge currency exposures

interest rates we manage interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt and may in the future utilize interest rate swap contracts 
we have fixed rate debt from our senior subordinated notes and our convertible senior subordinated notes

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists
