any factor described in this report could by itself  or together with one or more factors  have a negative effect on our business  results of operations and or financial condition 
there may be factors not described in this report that could also cause results to differ from our expectations 
our operating results may be affected if actual insured losses differ from our loss reserves 
significant periods of time often elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss by the insured and payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported losses and the related loss adjustment expense 
the process of estimating loss reserves is a difficult and complex exercise involving many variables and subjective judgments 
as part of the reserving process  we review historical data and consider the impact of various factors such as trends in claim frequency and severity  changes in operations  emerging economic and social trends  inflation  and changes in the regulatory and litigation environments 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate  but not necessarily accurate  basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  and actual results are likely to differ from original estimates 
our loss reserves also may be affected by court decisions that expand liability on our policies after they have been issued and priced 
in addition  a significant jury award  or series of awards  against one or more of our insureds could require us to pay large sums of money in excess of our reserved amounts 
our policy to aggressively litigate claims against our insureds may increase the risk that we may be required to make such payments 
to the extent loss reserves prove to be inadequate in the future  we would need to increase our loss reserves and incur a charge to earnings in the period the reserves are increased  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation and the price of our common stock 
if we are unable to maintain a favorable financial strength rating  it may be more difficult for us to write new business or renew our existing business 
independent rating agencies assess and rate the claims paying ability of insurers based upon criteria established by the agencies 
periodically the rating agencies evaluate us to confirm that we continue to meet the criteria of previously assigned ratings 
the financial strength ratings assigned by rating agencies to insurance companies represent independent opinions of financial strength and ability to meet policyholder obligations and are not directed toward the protection of investors 
ratings by rating agencies are not ratings of securities or recommendations to buy  hold or sell any security 
our principal operating subsidiaries hold favorable financial strength ratings with am best  standard poor s  fitch and other rating agencies 
financial strength ratings are used by agents and customers as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers 
if our financial position deteriorates  we may not maintain our favorable financial strength ratings from the rating agencies 
a downgrade or withdrawal of any such rating could limit or prevent us from writing desirable business 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive environment 
the property and casualty insurance business is highly competitive 
we compete with large national property and casualty insurance companies  locally based specialty companies  self insured entities and alternative risk transfer arrangements such as captive insurers and risk retention groups whose activities are directed to limited markets 
competitors include companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do  as well as mutual companies and similar companies not owned by shareholders whose return on equity objectives may be lower than ours 
competition in the property and casualty insurance business is based on many factors  including premiums charged and other terms and conditions of coverage  services provided  financial ratings assigned by independent rating agencies  claims services  reputation  perceived financial strength and the experience of the insurance company in the line of insurance to be written 
increased competition could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain business at current premium levels and reduce the profits that would otherwise arise from operations 
our revenues may fluctuate with insurance market conditions 
we derive a significant portion of our insurance premium revenue from medical malpractice risks 
between and  premium rates increased significantly which has improved our operating results 
we believe competition has increased in the medical malpractice industry with the recent increases in premium rates 
should our competitors become less disciplined in their pricing  or more permissive in their terms  we may lose customers who base their purchasing decisions primarily on price because our policy is to charge adequate premiums on risks that meet our underwriting standards 
we cannot predict whether  when or how market conditions will change  or the manner in which  or the extent to which any such changes may adversely impact the results of our operations 
our revenues may fluctuate with interest rates and investment results 
we generally rely on the positive performance of our investment portfolio to offset insurance losses and to contribute to our profitability 
as our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of interest earning assets  prevailing economic conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  may significantly affect our operating results 
changes in interest rates also can affect the value of our interest earning assets  which are principally comprised of fixed and adjustable rate investment securities 
generally  the values of fixed rate investment securities fluctuate inversely with changes in interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our stockholders equity  income and or cash flows 
our total investments at december  were billion  of which billion was invested in fixed maturities 
unrealized pre tax net investment losses on investments in fixed maturities were million at december  at december   we held equity investments having a fair value of million in an available for sale portfolio and held additional equity securities having a fair value of million in a trading portfolio 
the fair value of these securities fluctuates depending upon company specific and general market conditions 
any decline in the fair value of available for sale securities that we determine to be other than temporary will reduce our net income 
any changes in the fair values of trading securities  whether gains or losses  will be included in net income in the period changed 
changes in healthcare could have a material impact on our operations 
we derive substantially all of our medical professional liability insurance premiums from physicians and other individual healthcare providers  physician groups and smaller healthcare facilities 
significant attention has been focused on reforming the healthcare industry at both the federal and state levels which could result in changes to how health care providers insure their medical malpractice risks 
a broad range of healthcare reform measures has been suggested  and public discussion of such measures will likely continue in the future 
proposals have included  among others  spending limits  price controls  limiting increases in insurance premiums  limiting 
table of contents the liability of doctors and hospitals for tort claims  imposing liability on institutions rather than physicians  and restructuring the healthcare insurance system 
we cannot predict which  if any  reform proposals will be adopted  when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 
the adoption of certain of these proposals could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to regulatory and legislative efforts  there have been significant market driven changes in the healthcare environment 
in recent years  a number of factors related to the emergence of managed care have negatively impacted or threatened to impact the medical practice and economic independence of medical professionals 
medical professionals have found it more difficult to conduct a traditional fee for service practice and many have been driven to join or contractually affiliate with larger organizations 
such change and consolidation may result in the elimination of  or a significant decrease in  the role of the physician in the medical malpractice insurance purchasing decision 
it could also result in greater emphasis on the role of professional managers  who may seek to purchase insurance on a price competitive basis  and who may favor insurance companies that are larger and more highly rated than we are 
in addition  such change and consolidation could reduce our medical malpractice premiums as groups of insurance purchasers generally retain more risk or self insure 
the movement from traditional fee for service practice to the managed care environment may also result in an increase in the liability profile of our insureds 
the majority of our insured physicians practice in primary care specialties such as internal medicine  family practice  general practice and pediatrics 
in the managed care environment  these primary care physicians are being required to take on the role of gatekeeper and restrain the use of specialty care by controlling access to specialists and by performing certain procedures that would customarily be performed by specialists in a fee for service setting 
these practice changes may result in an increase in the claims frequency and severity experienced by primary care physicians and by us as their insurance carrier 
we are a holding company and are dependent on dividends and other payments from our operating subsidiaries  which are subject to dividend restrictions 
we are a holding company whose principal source of funds is cash dividends and other permitted payments from operating subsidiaries 
if our subsidiaries are unable to make payments to us  or are able to pay only limited amounts  we may be unable to make payments on our indebtedness 
the payment of dividends by these operating subsidiaries is subject to restrictions set forth in the insurance laws and regulations of their respective states of domicile  as discussed under item  insurance regulatory matters on page 
table of contents regulatory requirements could have a material impact on our operations 
our insurance businesses are subject to extensive regulation by state insurance authorities in each state in which they operate 
regulation is intended for the benefit of policyholders rather than shareholders 
in addition to the amount of dividends and other payments that can be made to a holding company by insurance subsidiaries  these regulatory authorities have broad administrative and supervisory power relating to licensing requirements  trade practices  capital and surplus requirements  investment practices  and rates charged to insurance customers 
these regulations may impede or impose burdensome conditions on rate increases or other actions that we may want to take to enhance our operating results 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in the course of complying with regulatory requirements 
most states also regulate insurance holding companies like us in a variety of matters such as acquisitions  changes of control and the terms of affiliated transactions 
future legislative or regulatory changes may also adversely affect our business operations 
the unpredictability of court decisions could have a material impact on our operations 
the financial position of our insurance subsidiaries may also be affected by court decisions that expand insurance coverage beyond the intention of the insurer at the time it originally issued an insurance policy 
in addition  a significant jury award  or series of awards  against one or more of our insureds could require us to pay large sums of money in excess of our reserve amounts 
the passage of tort reform or other legislation  and the subsequent review of such laws by the courts could have a material impact on our operations 
tort reforms generally restrict the ability of a plaintiff to recover damages by  among other limitations  eliminating certain claims that may be heard in a court  limiting the amount or types of damages  changing statutes of limitation or the period of time to make a claim  and limiting venue or court selection 
a number of states in which we do business have enacted  or are considering  tort reform legislation 
proposed federal tort reform legislation has failed to win congressional approval to date 
while the effects of tort reform would appear to be beneficial to our business generally  there can be no assurance that such reforms will be effective or ultimately upheld by the courts in the various states 
further  if tort reforms are effective  the business of providing professional liability insurance may become more attractive  thereby causing an increase in competition for us 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the benefits of tort reform will not be accompanied by legislation or regulatory actions that may be detrimental to our business 
for example  various states have established or are evaluating their intention to establish state sponsored malpractice insurance for their resident physicians that may eliminate targeted physicians from the private insurance market 
furthermore  insurance regulatory authorities may require premium rate limitations and expanded coverage requirements as well as other requirements in anticipation of the expected benefits of tort reform which may or may not be actually realized 
our geographic concentration ties our performance to the economic  regulatory and demographic conditions of the mid atlantic  midwest and southeast states 
our revenues and profitability are subject to prevailing economic  regulatory  demographic and other conditions in the states in which we write insurance 
we currently write professional liability insurance in states and the district of columbia  with approximately of gross premiums written in alabama  florida  indiana  michigan and ohio in because our business currently is concentrated in a limited number of markets  adverse developments that are 
table of contents limited to a geographic area in which we do business may have a disproportionately greater affect on us than they would have if we did business in markets outside that particular geographic area 
our business could be adversely affected by the loss of independent agents 
we depend in part on the services of independent agents and brokers in the marketing of our insurance products 
we face competition from other insurance companies for the services and allegiance of independent agents and brokers 
these agents and brokers may choose to direct business to competing insurance companies or may direct less desirable risks to us 
if market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable  we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for significant amounts of risk underwritten by our insurance company subsidiaries 
market conditions beyond our control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance  which may affect the level of our business and profitability 
we may be unable to maintain current reinsurance coverage or to obtain other reinsurance coverage in adequate amounts and at favorable rates 
if we are unable to renew our expiring coverage or to obtain new reinsurance coverage  either our net exposure to risk would increase or  if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net risk exposures  we would have to reduce the amount of our underwritten risk 
we cannot guarantee that our reinsurers will pay in a timely fashion  if at all  and  as a result  we could experience losses 
we transfer some of our risks to reinsurance companies in exchange for part of the premium we receive in connection with the risk 
although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred  it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders 
if reinsurers fail to pay us or fail to pay on a timely basis  our financial results would be adversely affected 
at december   we had reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately million 
the guaranty fund assessments that we are required to pay to state guaranty associations may increase and results of operations and financial condition could suffer as a result 
each state in which we operate has separate insurance guaranty fund laws requiring admitted property and casualty insurance companies doing business within their respective jurisdictions to be members of their guaranty associations 
these associations are organized to pay covered claims as defined and limited by the various guaranty association statutes under insurance policies issued by insolvent insurance companies 
most guaranty association laws enable the associations to make assessments against member insurers to obtain funds to pay covered claims after a member insurer becomes insolvent 
these associations levy assessments up to prescribed limits on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the covered lines of business in that state 
maximum assessments permitted by law in any one year generally vary between and of annual premiums written by a member in that state 
some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through surcharges on policyholders or through full or partial premium tax offsets  while other states permit recovery of assessments through the rate filing process 
property and casualty guaranty fund assessments incurred by us totaled  and  for and  respectively 
our policy is to accrue the insurance insolvencies when notified of assessments 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the liabilities of an insolvent insurer or develop a meaningful range of the insolvent insurer s liabilities because of inadequate financial data with respect to the estate of the insolvent company as supplied by the guaranty funds 

table of contents our business could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key employees 
we are heavily dependent upon our senior management and the loss of services of our senior executives could adversely affect our business 
our success has been  and will continue to be  dependent on our ability to retain the services of existing key employees and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of the services of key employees or senior managers  or the inability to identify  hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future  could adversely affect the quality and profitability of our business operations 
our board of directors is in the process of considering succession planning relating to our chief executive officer 
dr 
crowe  our current chairman and chief executive officer  has indicated to the board that he has no immediate plans for retirement 
provisions in our charter documents  delaware law and state insurance law may impede attempts to replace or remove management or impede a takeover  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a non negotiated merger or other business combination 
additionally  the board of directors may issue preferred stock  which could be used as an anti takeover device  without a further vote of our stockholders 
we currently have no preferred stock outstanding  and no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock 
however  because the rights and preferences of any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors in its sole discretion  the rights and preferences of any such preferred stock may be superior to those of our common stock and thus may adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock 
the voting structure of common stock and other provisions of our certificate of incorporation are intended to encourage a person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with  and to obtain the approval of  the board of directors in connection with a transaction 
however  certain of these provisions may discourage our future acquisition  including an acquisition in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
as a result  stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so 
in addition  state insurance laws provide that no person or entity may directly or indirectly acquire control of an insurance company unless that person or entity has received approval from the insurance regulator 
an acquisition of control of our insurance operating subsidiaries generally would be presumed if any person or entity acquires in alabama or more of its outstanding common stock  unless the applicable insurance regulator determines otherwise 
these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by stockholders 
if a change in management or a change of control is delayed or prevented  the market price of our common stock could decline

table of contents glossary of selected insurance and related financial terms in an effort to help our investors and other interested parties better understand our report  we are providing a glossary of selected insurance terms 
these definitions are taken from recognized industry sources such as a 
m 
best and the insurance information institute 
this list is intended to be informative and explanatory  but we do not represent that it is a comprehensive glossary 
accident year the accounting period in which an insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
admitted company  admitted basis an insurance company licensed and authorized to do business in a particular state 
an admitted company doing business in a state is said to operate on an admitted basis and is subject to all state insurance laws and regulations pertaining to its operations 
see non admitted company adverse selection the tendency of those exposed to a higher risk to seek more insurance coverage than those at a lower risk 
insurers react either by charging higher premiums or not insuring at all  as in the case of floods 
adverse selection can be seen as concentrating risk instead of spreading it 
agent an individual or firm that represents an insurer under a contractual or employment agreement for the purpose of selling insurance 
there are two types of agents independent agents  who represent one or more insurance companies but are not employed by those companies and are paid on commission  and exclusive or captive agents  who by contract are required to represent or favor only one insurance company and are either salaried or work on commission 
insurance companies that use employee or captive agents are called direct writers 
agents are compensated by the insurance company whose products they sell 
by definition  with respect to a given insurer  an agent is not a broker see brokers alternative markets mechanisms used to fund self insurance 
this includes captives  which are insurers owned by one or more non insurers to provide owners with coverage 
risk retention groups  formed by members of similar professions or businesses to obtain liability insurance  are also a form of self insurance 
assets  admitted  non admitted property owned  in this case by an insurance company  including stocks  bonds  and real estate 
because insurance accounting is concerned with solvency and the ability to pay claims  insurance regulators require a conservative valuation of assets  prohibiting insurance companies from listing assets on their balance sheets whose values are uncertain  such as furniture  fixtures  debit balances  and accounts receivable that are more than days past due these are non admitted assets 
admitted assets are those assets that can be easily sold in the event of liquidation or borrowed against  and receivables for which payment can be reasonably anticipated

laws governing surplus lines vary by state 
excess coverage  excess limits an insurance policy that provides coverage limits above another policy with similar coverage terms  or above a self insured amount 
extended reporting endorsement also known as a tail policy or tail premium 
tail coverage provides protection for future claims filed after a claims made policy has lapsed

tail coverage may also be granted if the insured becomes disabled  dies or permanently retired from the covered occupation ie  the practice of medicine in medical liability policies 
facultative reinsurance a generic term describing reinsurance where the reinsurer assumes all or a portion of a single risk 
each risk is separately evaluated and each contract is separately negotiated by the reinsurer 
frequency number of times a loss occurs per unit of risk or exposure

see casualty insurance  professional liability insurance  medical professional liability insurance limits maximum amount of insurance that can be paid for a covered loss 
long tail  short tail the long period of time between collecting the premium for insuring a risk and the ultimate payment of losses 
this allows insurance companies to invest the premiums until losses are paid  thus producing a higher level of invested assets and investment income as compared to other lines of property and casualty business 
medical professional liability is considered a long tail line of insurance 
personal lines is primarily considered a short tail line of insurance due to shorter time periods between insuring the risk and the ultimate payment of claims 
as a result  there is less time to invest premiums collected  which makes it necessary to achieve an underwriting profit in order to generate a satisfactory return on equity

non admitted company  basis insurers licensed in some states  but not others 
states where an insurer is not licensed call that insurer non admitted 
non admitted companies sell coverage that is unavailable from licensed insurers within a state and are generally exempt from most state laws and regulations related to rates and coverages 
policyholders of such companies generally do not have the same degree of consumer protection and financial recourse as policyholders of admitted companies 
non admitted companies are said to operate on a non admitted basis 
occurrence policy  coverage insurance that pays claims arising out of incidents that occur during the policy term  even if they are filed many years later

rating agencies these agencies assess insurers financial strength and viability to meet claims obligations 
some of the factors considered include company earnings  capital adequacy  operating leverage  liquidity  investment performance  reinsurance programs  and management ability  integrity and experience 
a high financial rating is not the same as a high consumer satisfaction rating 
reinsurance insurance bought by insurance companies 
in a reinsurance contract the reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company  the ceding company  against all or a portion of the insurance or reinsurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more policies 
reinsurers may have their own reinsurers  called retrocessionaires 
reinsurers don t pay policyholder claims 
instead  they reimburse insurers for claims paid 
reinsured layer  retained layer the retained layer is the cumulative portion of each loss  on a per claim basis  which is less than an insurer s reinsurance retention for a given coverage year 
likewise  the reinsured layer is the cumulative portion of each loss that exceeds the reinsurance retention 
see reinsurance  retention reserves a company s best estimate of what it will pay  at some point in the future  for claims for which it is currently responsible

risk based capital rbc a regulatory measure of the amount of capital required for an insurance company  based upon the volume and inherent riskiness of the insurance sold  the composition of its investment portfolio and other financial risk factors 
higher risk types of insurance  liability as opposed to property business  generally necessitate higher levels of capital 
the naic s rbc model law stipulates four levels of regulatory action with the degree of regulatory intervention increasing as the level of surplus falls below a minimum amount as determined under the model law 
see naic risk management management of the varied risks to which a business firm or association might be subject 
it includes analyzing all exposures to gauge the likelihood of loss and choosing options to better manage or minimize loss 
these options typically include reducing and eliminating the risk with safety measures  buying insurance  and self insurance 
self insurance the concept of assuming a financial risk oneself  instead of paying an insurance company to take it on 
every policyholder is a self insurer in terms of paying a deductible and co payments 
larger policyholders often self insure frequent or predictable losses to avoid insurance overhead expenses

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto accompanying this report 
throughout the discussion  references to proassurance  we  us and our refers to proassurance corporation and its subsidiaries 
the discussion contains certain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
as discussed under forward looking statements and risk factors  our actual financial condition and operating results could differ significantly from these forward looking statements 
in late we reached an agreement to sell our personal lines operations 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements report our personal lines operations  which were formerly reported as a separate operating segment  as a component of discontinued operations in all periods presented 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operations will not be materially affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions 
management considers the following accounting policies to be critical because they involve significant judgment by management and the effect of those judgments could result in a material effect on our financial statements 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve for losses or reserve our reserve for losses represents our estimate of the future amounts necessary to pay claims and expenses associated with the settlement and investigation of claims 
these estimates consist of case reserves and bulk reserves 
the estimates take into consideration our past loss experience  available industry data and projections as to future claims frequency  severity  inflationary trends and settlement patterns 
external actuaries review our reserve for losses each year 
we consider the views of the external actuaries as well as other factors  such as known  anticipated or estimated changes in frequency and severity of claims and loss retention levels and premium rates  in establishing the amount of our reserve for losses 
estimating casualty insurance reserves  and particularly liability reserves  is a complex process 
these claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often five years or more  and estimating loss costs for these claims requires multiple judgments involving many uncertainties 
our reserve estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
the assumptions used in establishing our reserve for losses are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reserve for losses  even a small percentage adjustment to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
reinsurance our receivable from reinsurers on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents our estimate of the amount of our reserve for losses that will be recoverable from our reinsurers 
our estimate is based upon our estimates of the ultimate losses that we expect to incur and the portion of those losses that we expect to be allocable to reinsurers based upon the terms of our reinsurance agreements 
we also estimate premiums ceded under reinsurance agreements wherein the premium due to the reinsurer  subject to certain maximums and minimums  is based on losses reimbursed under the agreement 
our estimates of the amounts receivable from and payable to reinsurers are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
given the uncertainty of the ultimate amounts of our losses  these estimates may vary significantly from the eventual outcome 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reinsurance balances  even a small adjustment 
table of contents to these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
we evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at its inception to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting guidance 
at december  all ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transferring contracts 
our assessment of the collectibility of the recorded amounts receivable from reinsurers considers both the payment history of the reinsurer and publicly available financial and rating agency data 
at december  we believe all of our recorded reinsurance receivables to be collectible 
investments we consider our fixed maturity securities as available for sale and our equity securities as either available for sale or trading portfolio securities 
both available for sale and trading portfolio securities are carried at fair value 
changes in the market value unrealized gains and losses of available for sale securities  whether positive or negative  are included  net of the related tax effect  in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  and are excluded from current period net income 
positive and negative changes in the market value of trading portfolio securities are included in current period net income as a component of net realized investment gains losses 
we evaluate the securities in our available for sale investment portfolio on at least a quarterly basis for declines in market value below cost for the purpose of determining whether these declines represent other than temporary declines 
some of the factors we consider in the evaluation of our investments are the extent to which the market value of the security is less than its cost basis  the length of time for which the market value of the security has been less than its cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the security s issuer  taking into consideration the economic prospects of the issuer s industry and geographical region  to the extent that information is publicly available  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
a decline in the fair value of an available for sale security below cost that we judge to be other than temporary is realized as a loss in the current period income statement and reduces the cost basis of the security 
in subsequent periods  we base any measurement of gain or loss or decline in value upon the adjusted cost basis of the security 
deferred policy acquisition costs policy acquisition costs  primarily commissions  premium taxes and underwriting salaries  vary directly with  and are primarily related to  the acquisition of new and renewal premiums 
such costs are capitalized and charged to expense as the related premium revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred policy acquisition costs based on our estimates of the profitability of the underlying business and any amounts estimated to be unrecoverable are charged to expense in the current period 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets we make an annual assessment as to whether the value of our goodwill assets is impaired 
we completed such assessments in and and concluded that the value of our goodwill assets related to continuing operations of approximately million was not impaired 
we use both market based valuation models and a capital asset pricing model to estimate the fair value 
these models require the use of numerous assumptions regarding market perceptions of value as related to our consolidated and reporting unit historical and projected operating results and those of other economically similar entities 
changes to these assumptions could significantly lower our estimates of fair value and result in a 
table of contents determination that goodwill has suffered impairment in value 
any determined impairment would be reflected as an expense in the period identified 
overview we are an insurance holding company and our operating results are almost entirely derived from the operations of our insurance subsidiaries 
our core operating subsidiaries are the medical assurance company  inc  pronational insurance company  ncric  inc and red mountain casualty insurance company  inc  all principally write professional liability insurance 
we also write a limited amount of medical professional liability insurance through woodbrook casualty insurance  inc formerly medical assurance of west virginia  inc 
corporate strategy our goal is to build upon our position as a leading writer of professional liability insurance and expand principally within the mid atlantic  midwest and southeast  while maintaining our commitment to disciplined underwriting and aggressive claims management 
according to am best  based on data  we are the fourth largest active medical liability insurance writer in the nation  and we believe we are the largest medical liability writer in our collective states of operation 
we believe that our strong reputation in our regional markets  combined with our financial strength  strong customer service and proven ability to manage claims  should enable us to profitably expand our position in select states 
we have successfully acquired and integrated companies and books of business in the past and believe our financial size and strength make us an attractive acquirer 
we continually evaluate these opportunities to leverage our core underwriting and claims expertise 
we emphasize disciplined underwriting and do not manage our business to achieve a certain level of premium growth or market share 
we apply our local knowledge to individual risk selection and determine the appropriate price based on our assessment of the specific characteristics of each risk 
in addition to prudent risk selection  we seek to control our underwriting results through effective claims management 
we investigate each claim and have fostered a strong culture of aggressively defending claims that we believe have no merit 
we manage claims at the local level  tailoring claims handling to the legal climate of each state  which we believe differentiates us from national writers 
through our regional underwriting and claims office structure  we are able to gain a strong understanding of local market conditions and efficiently adapt our underwriting and claims strategies to regional conditions 
our regional presence also allows us to maintain active relationships with our customers and be more responsive to their needs 
we believe these factors allow us to compete on a basis other than just price 
we also believe that our presence in local markets allows us to monitor and understand changes in the liability climate and thus develop better business strategies in a more timely manner than our competitors 
we have sustained our financial stability during difficult market conditions through responsible pricing and loss reserving practices 
we are committed to maintaining prudent operating and financial leverage and conservatively investing our assets 
we recognize the importance that our customers and producers place on the strong ratings of our principal insurance subsidiaries and we intend to manage our business to protect our financial security 
we measure performance in a number of ways  but particularly focus on our combined ratio and investment returns  both of which directly affect our return on equity roe 
we target a long term average roe of to 
we believe that a focus on rate adequacy  selective underwriting and effective claims management is required if we are to achieve our roe targets 
we closely monitor premium revenues  losses and loss adjustment costs  and acquisition  underwriting and insurance expenses 
our investment portfolio is managed in order to meet the liquidity and profitability needs of each insurance company as well as to maximize after tax investment returns on a consolidated basis 
we engage in activities that generate other income  however  such activities  principally fee generating and agency services  do not constitute a significant source of revenues or profits 

table of contents growth opportunities and outlook we expect our future growth will be supported by controlled expansion in states where we are already writing business and into additional states within  or adjacent to  our existing business footprint 
we also look to expand through the acquisition of other companies or books of business  however  such expansion is opportunistic and cannot be predicted 
we believe we are viewed as a market leader because of our financial strength and stability  and our ability to deliver excellent service at the local level 
there have been several highly publicized insolvencies in our industry in recent years  and regulators have taken action against former competitors because of financial concerns 
thus  we believe our balance sheet strength and financial stability will continue to be a differentiating factor in the market 
we have seen an increase in competition during the year by both existing professional liability insurers as well as new entrants  primarily in the form of risk retention groups and other risk pooling mechanisms 
while most existing competitors appear to be maintaining pricing and underwriting discipline  we are seeing an increase in competition  especially on price 
the new entrants are typically more aggressive in seeking new business and are generally more willing to compete on price 
as a result of these market forces  profitable growth in the coming year will be challenging 
nevertheless we will continue to price our products at levels that we believe meet our return objectives and we will continue to disregard business that does not 
we achieved average gross price increases of approximately  and  on renewal business weighted by premium volume in  and  respectively 
in we expect professional liability pricing to increase at a slower pace 
the price increases implemented over the last several years have brought our pricing to a level that we believe is adequate to meet our return objectives 
we plan to maintain this pricing level by using future rate increases to counteract loss cost inflation 
recent significant events on august  proassurance acquired all of the outstanding common stock of ncric corporation ncric in a stock for stock merger 
ncric s primary business is a single property and casualty insurance company that provides medical professional liability insurance in the district of columbia  delaware  maryland  virginia and west virginia 
the primary purpose for the transaction was to expand marketing opportunities for our professional liability insurance products 
as part of the ncric merger  we also acquired consicare  a subsidiary which provides administrative and financial services to physician practices 
consicare s business focus is not consistent with our strategy as a specialty insurance company  and we therefore sold consicare for million on december  the operating results of consicare are presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a component of discontinued operations 
there was no gain or loss on the sale because our carrying value for consicare approximated the sale price less sale expenses  adjusted for the tax effects of the sale 
the following chart summarizes the ncric acquisition in millions fair value of million proassurance common shares issued other acquisition costs aggregate purchase price fair value of net assets acquired excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired  recognized as goodwill on january  we sold our personal lines operations the meemic companies  effective january  the transaction is worth million to us before transaction expenses 
motors insurance corporation motors  a subsidiary of gmac insurance holdings  inc  paid approximately million in cash for meemic insurance company and its internal agency  and we retained approximately million of the meemic companies pre sale capital 
sale proceeds will support the capital 
table of contents requirements of our professional liability insurance subsidiaries and other general corporate purposes 
following the sale  our total assets will decline by million million assets sold less proceeds of million and our liabilities will decline by million 
our stockholders equity will increase by the gain recognized on the transaction  which we expect to be approximately million after consideration of sale expenses and the tax effects of the sale 
because these operations have been sold  the assets  liabilities and operating results of the meemic companies are reported as a component of discontinued operations in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
previously  we reported our personal lines operations and our professional liability operations as separate reportable segments  net investment income of the parent holding company and interest expense on long term debt corporate income were not allocated to either segment 
this reporting structure was reflected in prior filings 
our continuing operations now represent a single reportable segment and combine corporate income with the results of the professional liability segment 
additional information regarding the previously described transactions is provided in note acquisition of ncric and note  discontinued operations of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
on december   we reached a definitive agreement with physicians insurance company of wisconsin  inc pic wisconsin whereby we agreed to acquire pic wisconsin in an all stock merger transaction having an estimated value of million 
pic wisconsin is a wisconsin domiciled stock insurance company  its shares are not registered under the securities exchange act of there is no gaap financial data available for pic wisconsin 
audited december  statutory reports for pic wisconsin present cash and invested assets of million  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of million  capital and surplus of million and earned premiums of million 
the transaction is subject to approval by pic wisconsin shareholders and required regulatory approvals 
we filed a registration statement and a proxy statement prospectus with the securities and exchange commission sec on february  which is not yet effective 
for more information regarding the proposed merger refer to the registration statement  sec file number liquidity and capital resources and financial condition the following discussions of changes in our financial condition and operating results exclude amounts that are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements  as discussed under the caption recent significant events and in note of our consolidated financial statements 
proassurance corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
because the parent holding company has no other business operations  dividends from its operating subsidiaries represent a significant source of funds for its obligations  including debt service 
the ability of those insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limitation by state insurance regulations 
see our discussions under regulation of dividends from our operating subsidiaries in part i  and in note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding dividend limitations 
within our operating subsidiaries our primary need for liquidity is to pay losses and operating expenses in the ordinary course of business 
our operating activities provided positive cash flow of million for the year ended december   which is comparable to cash provided by operations of million for the year ended december  our december  operating cash flow includes million generated by ncric operating activities from the august purchase date forward 
the primary sources of our operating cash flows are net investment income and the excess of premiums collected over net losses paid and operating costs 
timing delays exist between the collection of premiums and the payment of losses 
a general measure of this timing delay is the ratio of paid to incurred losses  which is computed by dividing paid losses for the period by incurred losses 
our paid to incurred loss ratios for the years ended december  and are and  respectively 

table of contents the cash flows of the personal lines segment have historically not been used to support our professional liability operations 
it is not expected that the sale of the personal lines segment will have a detrimental effect on the liquidity of our continuing operations 
we believe that rate adequacy is critical to our long term liquidity 
we continually review rates and submit requests for rate increases to state insurance departments as we consider necessary to maintain rate adequacy 
we are unable to predict whether we will continue to receive approval for our rate filings 
in most jurisdictions we are required to receive approval of these rate increases before we can factor them into the pricing of our products 
we manage our investment portfolio to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations  taking into consideration the timing of cash flows from our investments as well as the expected cash flows to be generated by our operations 
at our insurance subsidiaries the primary outflow of cash is related to the payment of claims and expenses 
the payment of individual claims cannot be predicted with certainty  therefore  we rely upon the history of paid claims in determining the expected future claims payments 
to the extent that we have an unanticipated shortfall in cash we may either liquidate securities held in our investment portfolio or borrow funds under previously established borrowing arrangements 
however  given the significant cash flows being generated by our operations and the relatively short duration of our investment portfolio we do not foresee any such shortfall 
cash and invested assets increased million over the prior year 
the increase is attributable to the aforementioned operating cash flow as well as the addition of ncric  which held cash and investments of million at december  the fair value of our investment portfolio decreased million as a result of the rising rate environment in we transfer most of the cash generated from operations into our investment portfolio 
we held cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  and million at december  at december  our investment in fixed maturity securities is billion  representing of our total investments 
substantially all of our fixed maturities are either united states government agency obligations or investment grade securities as determined by national rating agencies 
the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio have a dollar weighted average rating of aa at december  our investment policy implements an asset allocation that uses length to maturity as one method of managing our long term rate of return 
the weighted average effective duration of our fixed maturity securities at december  is years 
changes in market interest rate levels generally affect our net income to the extent that reinvestment yields are different than the original yields on maturing securities 
additionally  changes in market interest rates also affect the fair value of our fixed maturity securities 
bond interest rates have increased since december  and as a result average bond market values have decreased 
on a pre tax basis  net unrealized gains losses related to our available for sale fixed maturity securities decreased from a net unrealized gain of million at december  to a net unrealized loss of million at december  at december   available for sale and trading portfolio equity investments total million  representing approximately of our total investments  and approximately of our capital 
these holdings decreased from million at december  our investment in short term securities at december  is million as compared to million at december  approximately million of this increase is attributable to ncric 
we have elected to hold more funds in short term securities during in order to increase our investment flexibility in a rising rate environment 
as our investment managers identify investment opportunities that are consistent with our longer range investment strategy we plan to move funds from short term securities to longer term fixed maturity securities 
for a more detailed discussion of the effect of changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents our long term debt at december  is comprised of the following due rate in thousands convertible debentures june  fixed  subordinated debentures april may  libor adjusted  subordinated debentures december  libor adjusted  assumed in ncric transaction we may redeem the convertible debentures on or after july  with notice 
holders may require us to repurchase their debentures on june of   and also  holders may convert their debentures if the market value of our common stock exceeds the product of the conversion price currently multiplied by for of the trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter 
upon conversion  holders will receive shares of common stock for each  principal amount of debentures surrendered for conversion 
we have the right to deliver  in lieu of common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
the and subordinated debentures may be redeemed at our option in december and april  respectively 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our long term debt 
as a result of the acquisition of ncric  we assumed the risk of loss for a judgment entered against ncric on february  by a district of columbia superior court in favor of columbia hospital for women medical center  inc chw in the amount of million the chw judgment 
by order of september   the trial court denied all post trial relief sought by ncric and ncric has appealed the judgment 
ncric posted a million appellate bond and associated letter of credit to secure payment of the chw judgment plus interest and costs  in the event the judgment is ultimately affirmed and paid 
in accordance with sfas  we established a liability of million for this judgment and included the liability as a component of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the allocation of the ncric purchase price 
losses losses are the largest component of expense for our operations 
as discussed in critical accounting policies  net losses in any period reflect our estimate of net losses related to the premiums earned in that period as well as any changes to our estimates of the reserve established for net losses of prior periods 
the estimation of medical professional liability losses is inherently difficult 
injuries may not be discovered until years after an incident  or the claimant may delay pursuing the recovery of damages 
ultimate loss costs  even for similar events  vary significantly depending upon many factors  including but not limited to the nature of the injury and the personal situation of the claimant or the claimants family  the judicial climate where the insured event occurred  general economic conditions and the trend of health care costs 
medical liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often five years or more 
the combination of changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss cost estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of judgment  and such estimates require periodic revision 
in establishing our reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses management considers a variety of factors including historical paid and incurred loss development trends  the effect of inflation on medical care  general economic trends and the legal environment 
given the number of factors considered it is neither practical nor meaningful to isolate a particular assumption or parameter of the process and calculate the impact of changing that single item 
we perform an in depth review of our loss reserve on a semi annual basis 
however  management is continually reviewing and updating the data 
table of contents underlying the estimation of our loss reserve and we make adjustments that we believe the emerging data indicate 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in the then current operations 
as a result of the variety of factors that must be considered by management there is a significant risk that actual incurred losses will develop differently from these estimates 
we use a variety of actuarial methodologies in performing these analyses 
among the methods that we have used are paid development method reported development method bornhuetter ferguson method average paid value method average reported value method backward recursive method generally  methods such as the bornheutter ferguson method are used on more recent accident years where we have less data on which to base our analysis 
as business seasons and we have an increased amount of data for a given accident year we begin to give more confidence to the development and average methods as these methods typically rely more heavily on our own historical data 
each of these methods treats our assumptions differently  and thus provides a different perspective on the particular business under review 
the various actuarial methods discussed above are applied in a consistent manner from period to period 
in addition  we perform statistical reviews of claim data such as claim counts  average settlement costs and severity trends 
in performing these analyses we partition our business by type  coverage type  geography  layer of coverage and accident year 
this procedure is intended to balance the use of the most representative data for each partition  capturing its unique patterns of development and trends 
for each partition  the results of the various methods  along with the supplementary statistical data regarding such factors as the current economic environment  are used to develop a point estimate based upon management s judgment and past experience 
the process of selecting the point estimate from the set of possible outcomes produced by the various actuarial methods is based upon the judgment of management and is not driven by formulaic determination 
for each partition of our business we select a point estimate with due regard for the age  characteristics and volatility of the partition of the business  the volume of data available for review and past experience with respect to the accuracy of estimates for business of a similar type 
this series of selected point estimates is then combined to produce an overall point estimate for ultimate losses 
the company has modeled implied reserve ranges around its single point reserve estimates for its professional liability business assuming different confidence levels 
the ranges have been developed by aggregating the expected volatility of losses across partitions of our business to obtain a consolidated distribution of potential reserve outcomes 
the aggregation of this data takes into consideration the correlation among the company s geographic and specialty mix of business 
the result of the correlation approach to aggregation is that the ranges are narrower than the sum of the ranges determined for each partition 
the company has used this modeled statistical distribution to calculate an and confidence interval for the potential outcome of our reserves 
the high and low end points of the ranges are as follows low end point carried reserves high end point confidence level billion billion billion confidence level billion billion billion the development of a reserve range models the uncertainty of the claim environment as well as the limited predictive power of past loss data 
these uncertainties and limitations are not specific to the company 
the ranges represent an estimate of the range of possible outcomes and should not be confused with a range of best estimates 
any change in our estimate of reserves would be reflected in then current operations 
due to the size of our reserve for losses  even a small percentage adjustment to 
table of contents these estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
the following table  known as the loss reserve development table  presents information over the preceding ten years regarding the payment of our losses as well as changes to the development of our estimates of losses during that time period 
years prior to relate only to the reserves of medical assurance 
in years and thereafter the table reflects the reserves of proassurance  formed in in order to merge medical assurance and professionals group 
ncric reserves are included only in the year since ncric was acquired in that year 
the table does not include the loss reserves of personal lines operations  which are reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations 
the table includes losses on both a direct and an assumed basis and is net of reinsurance recoverables 
the gross liability for losses before reinsurance  as shown on the balance sheet  and the reconciliation of that gross liability to amounts net of reinsurance are reflected below the table 
we do not discount our reserves to present value 
information presented in the table is cumulative and  accordingly  each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior years 
the table presents the development of our balance sheet reserves  it does not present accident year or policy year development data 
conditions and trends that have affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on this table 
the following may be helpful in understanding the loss reserve development table the line entitled reserve for losses  undiscounted and net of reinsurance recoverables reflects the company s reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense  less the receivables from reinsurers  each as showing in the company s consolidated financial statements at the end of each year the balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled cumulative net paid  as of reflects the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of each succeeding year with respect to the previously recorded balance sheet reserves 
the section entitled re estimated net liability as of reflects the re estimated amount of the liability previously recorded as balance sheet reserves that includes the cumulative amounts paid and an estimate of additional liability based upon claims experience as of the end of each succeeding year the net re estimated liability 
the line entitled net cumulative redundancy deficiency reflects the difference between the previously recorded balance sheet reserve for each applicable year and the net re estimated liability relating thereto as of the end of the most recent fiscal year

table of contents in each year reflected in the table  we have utilized the actuarial methodologies discussed previously to estimate reserves 
these techniques are applied to the data in a consistent manner and the resulting projections are evaluated by management to establish the estimate of reserves 
factors that have contributed to the variation in loss development include the following our volume of business and the corresponding data in the late s and early s  while substantial  was not of a sufficient size to fully support the actuarial projection process without the use of industry based data 
substantially all of our business was derived from medical professional liability insurance written in alabama until we began to geographically expand our business in the mid to late s 
we utilized a rigorous and disciplined approach to investigating  managing and defending claims 
this philosophy generally produced results in alabama that were better than industry averages in terms of loss payments and the proportion of claims closed without indemnity payment 
ultimately  actual results proved better than the industry data  creating redundancies 
our reserves established in the late s and early s were strongly influenced by the dramatically increased frequency and severity that we  and the industry as a whole  experienced during the mid s 
some of these trends moderated  and in some cases  reversed  by the late s or early s 
however  the ability to recognize the improved environment was delayed due to the extended time required for claims resolution 
when these negative trends moderated  the reserves we established during those periods proved to be redundant 
the professional liability legal environment deteriorated once again in the late s 
beginning in  we recognized adverse trends in claim severity causing increased estimates of certain loss liabilities 
as a result  favorable development of prior year loss reserves slowed in and reversed in and we have addressed these trends through increased rates  stricter underwriting and modifications to claims handling procedures 
during and we recognized favorable development related to our previously established reserves  primarily to reflect reductions in our estimates of claim severity 

table of contents at december  our reserve for losses  net of the receivable from reinsurers  is billion  an increase of million over net reserves at december   which includes ncric net reserves acquired in august of million 
our receivable from reinsurers at december  is million  of which million is attributable to ncric 
our reserve for losses continues to grow given the generally long tailed nature of professional liability lines of business 
several years can pass between the initial recognition of a claim and the ultimate settlement of that claim 
this  coupled with the growth in the number of policies we issue has resulted in an increase in loss reserve

our insurance subsidiaries had consolidated reserves for losses on a gaap basis that exceeded those on a statutory basis by approximately million  which is principally due to the portion of gaap reserves that are reflected for statutory accounting purposes as unearned premiums 
these unearned premiums are applicable to extended reporting endorsements tail coverage issued without a premium charge upon death  disability  or retirement of an insured 
reinsurance we use reinsurance to provide capacity to write large limits of liability  to reduce losses of a catastrophic nature and to stabilize underwriting results in those years in which such losses occur 
the purchase of reinsurance does not relieve us from the ultimate risk on our policies  but it does provide reimbursement from the reinsurer for certain losses paid by us 
we reinsure professional liability risks under treaties pursuant to which the reinsurer agrees to assume all or a portion of all risks that we insure above our individual risk retention of million per claim  up to the maximum individual limit offered currently million 
historically  per claim retention levels have varied between the first  and the first million depending on the coverage year and the state in which business was written 
periodically  we provide insurance to policyholders above the maximum limits of our primary reinsurance treaties 
in those situations  we reinsure the excess risk above the limits of our reinsurance treaties on a facultative basis  whereby the reinsurer agrees to insure a particular risk up to a designated limit 
our risk retention level is dependent upon numerous factors including our risk appetite and the capital we have to support it  the price and availability of reinsurance  volume of business  level of 
table of contents experience and our analysis of the potential underwriting results within each state 
our reinsurance treaties renewed with minimal change in terms or conditions from the prior year 
the effective transfer of risk is dependent on the credit worthiness of the reinsurer 
we purchase reinsurance from a number of companies to mitigate concentrations of credit risk 
our reinsurance broker assists us in the analysis of the credit quality of our reinsurers 
we base our reinsurance buying decisions on an evaluation of the then current financial strength  rating and stability of prospective reinsurers 
however  the financial strength of our reinsurers  and their corresponding ability to pay us  may change in the future due to forces or events we cannot control or anticipate 
we have not experienced any significant difficulties in collecting amounts due from reinsurers due to the financial condition of the reinsurer 
should future events lead us to believe that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations to us  adjustments to the amounts recoverable would be reflected in the results of current operations

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  selected consolidated financial data for each period is summarized in the table below 
year ended december increase decrease in thousands revenues gross premiums written net premiums written premiums earned premiums ceded net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains losses other income total revenues expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses reinsurance recoveries net losses and loss adjustment expenses underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses interest expense total expenses income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income net loss ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio operating ratio return on equity the increases in our annualized roe and our operating results for the year are primarily attributable to our success in reducing our net loss ratio 
in addition  we held more invested assets while market interest rates were increasing  which generated additional investment income 

table of contents effect of acquisition of ncric we acquired ncric on august  and our results for the year ended december  include ncric results since the date of acquisition only 
in the following tables  in order to facilitate an understanding of the effect of ncric  we have segregated results attributable to ncric in a separate line item titled ncric 
the designation pra  prior refers to proassurance s results excluding ncric 
unless otherwise indicated  our discussions of variances between operating periods are presented exclusive of the amounts attributed to ncric operations 
premiums premiums written changed in as a result of competition  selective underwriting  the reduced need for rate increases and the acquisition of ncric 
this acquisition is consistent with our stated strategy to grow premiums both organically and through selective acquisitions 
gross premiums written year ended december increase decrease in thousands pra  prior ncric   n a continuing operations premiums written vary from period to period for a number of reasons 
some of the more common differences result from changes to premium rates  changes in the coverages chosen by our insureds  the volume of new business written during the period  the loss of business to competitors or due to our own underwriting decisions  and the percentage of our policies that renew  which may also affect the level of tail premiums written 
changes in the markets in which we operate  such as the entry or exit of a competitor in a given market and changes in the rate structures of our competitors  also affect written premiums from period to period 
the effect of any of these changes also varies by the proportion of policies written or renewed during each period in the various geographical regions and classes of business in which we operate 
approximately million of the decrease in premiums written  excluding ncric  represents a decrease in physician premiums for non tail coverages  which is our principal insurance product  comprising of our total written premiums 
in  rates on our renewed policies averaged higher than the expiring premiums 
however  the beneficial effect of the rate increases and new business was offset by the effect of policies that did not renew 
in addition  some insureds chose to take lower limits of coverage  and in some cases we decided to move away from volatile jurisdictions where rates are higher toward stable states where rates may be lower 
our retention rate averaged in  as compared to in  but increased price competition in several states reduced the volume of new business that we were able to write 
we remain committed to an adequate rate structure and have forgone business that we believed could not be written at profitable rates 
tail policies are offered to insureds that are discontinuing their claims made coverage with us  and the amount of tail premium written in any annual period can and does vary widely 
tail premiums represented approximately of total written premiums in and approximately of total written premiums in tail premiums declined by approximately million in as compared to while we offer tail coverage to departing insureds as an obligation under our policy provisions  our preference is to sell less rather than more of this coverage since it represents a long term liability with increased pricing risk 
hospital premiums  which comprise of our premiums written in and  declined by approximately million as compared to such business is highly price sensitive 
as in all our lines  we choose not to compete primarily on price because our focus is on maintaining adequate margins on the policies we sell 
thus  our hospital premiums fluctuate based on competitive forces largely beyond our control 

table of contents premiums earned year ended december increase decrease in thousands pra  prior ncric   n a continuing operations because premiums are generally earned pro rata over the entire policy period after the policy is written  fluctuations in premiums earned tend to lag those of premiums written 
policies generally carry a term of one year 
professional liability tail policies are earned in the period written because the policies are non cancelable and insure only incidents that occurred in prior periods 
the increase in earned premiums reflects on a pro rata basis the changes in written premiums that occurred during both and late  reduced by lower tail premiums written in as discussed in the section on premiums written 
premiums ceded year ended december increase decrease in thousands pra  prior ncric   n a continuing operations premiums ceded represent the portion of earned premiums that we must ultimately pay to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
we reduced ceded premiums by million in to reflect changes in our estimates of the amount of reinsurance premiums due for certain prior accident years  based on the provisions of the reinsurance contracts and our estimates of the reinsured losses for those prior accident years 
we also reduced ceded premiums in by approximately million due to the commutation of certain reinsurance contracts 
after consideration of the effect of these adjustments  there is little change in ceded premiums as compared to losses and loss adjustment expenses the estimation of medical professional liability losses is inherently difficult 
injuries may not be discovered until years after an incident  or the claimant may delay pursuing the recovery of damages 
ultimate loss costs  even for similar events  vary significantly depending upon many factors  including but not limited to the nature of the injury and the personal situation of the claimant or the claimant s family  the judicial climate where the insured event occurred  general economic conditions and the trend of health care costs 
medical liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often five years or more 
the combination of changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss cost estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of judgment  and such estimates require periodic revision 
calendar year losses may be divided into three components i actuarial evaluation of incurred losses for the current accident year  ii actuarial re evaluation of incurred losses for prior accident years  and iii actuarial re evaluation of the reserve for the death  disability and retirement provision ddr in our claims made policies 
accident year refers to the accounting period in which the insured event becomes a liability of the insurer 
for occurrence policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event takes place  for claims made policies the insured event becomes a liability when the event is first reported to the insurer 
we believe that measuring losses on an accident year basis is the most indicative measure of the underlying profitability of the premiums earned in that period since it associates policy premiums earned with our estimate of the losses incurred related to those policy premiums 
calendar year results include 
table of contents the operating results for the current accident year and  as discussed in critical accounting policies  any changes in estimates related to prior accident years 
the following tables summarize net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 
net losses net loss ratios year ended december year ended december increase increase decrease decrease in thousands calendar year pra  prior ncric   n a continuing operations current accident year pra  prior ncric   n a continuing operations prior accident year pra  prior net losses as specified divided by net premiums earned 
current accident year net loss ratios are lower in as compared to due to several factors 
we have focused for several years on developing and maintaining adequate rates 
as rate adequacy has improved  loss ratios have decreased 
also  our expected loss ratios vary based upon geographic location  coverage type and coverage limits 
in as compared to  changes in the mix of insured risks reduced overall expected loss ratios 
during we recognized favorable development of million related to our previously established reserves  primarily to reflect reductions in our estimates of claim severity 
the most significant reduction was seen in the accident year  however  favorable development was also seen in accident years and prior 
assumptions used in establishing our reserve are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in current operations 
due to the size of our reserve  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made 

table of contents gross losses and reinsurance recoveries the effect of adjustments made to reinsured losses is mitigated by the corresponding adjustment that is made to insurance recoveries 
thus  in any given year  we may make significant adjustments to gross losses that have a less significant effect on our net losses 
the following table reflects our losses on both a gross and a net basis 
gross and net losses year ended december increase decrease in thousands gross losses pra  prior ncric consolidated reinsurance recoveries pra  prior ncric consolidated net losses pra  prior ncric consolidated when discussing losses that are reinsured and losses that are retained  it is common to refer to layers of loss 
the retained layer is the cumulative portion of each loss  on a per claim basis  which is less than our reinsurance retention for a given coverage year 
likewise  the reinsured layer is the cumulative portion of each loss that exceeds the reinsurance retention 
our actuarial analysis of our reserve indicated that our claims severity had continued to increase as expected in our retained layers  but not to the degree anticipated in our original reserve estimates 
this was also true in our reinsured layers  but the variance between our original estimates and the actuarial estimate was smaller 
accordingly  we reduced our estimates of prior accident year gross losses by million and reduced the prior accident year reinsurance recoveries by million  for a net adjustment to prior year losses of million 
our actuarial analysis of our reserve indicated that our claims severity had continued to increase as expected in risk retained by proassurance 
however  in risks ceded to our reinsurers actual loss experience proved to be lower than we originally anticipated and for which we established our reserve 
accordingly  we reduced our estimates of prior accident year gross losses by approximately million and reduced the corresponding reinsurance recoveries by million  for a net adjustment to prior year losses of million 
the decrease to reinsurance recoveries for prior accident years more than offset reinsurance recoveries for current accident years resulting in a non traditional relationship between gross losses and recoveries for the year ended december  
table of contents net investment income and net realized investment gains losses net investment income is primarily derived from the interest income earned by our fixed maturity securities and includes interest income from short term and cash equivalent investments  dividend income from equity securities  earnings from limited partnerships  increases in the cash surrender value of business owned executive life insurance contracts  and rental income earned by our commercial real estate holdings 
investment fees and expenses and real estate expenses are deducted from investment income 
net investment income year ended december increase decrease in thousands pra  prior ncric   n a continuing operations the increase in net investment income is principally due to higher average invested funds during the positive cash flow generated by our insurance operations significantly increased our average invested funds 
rising market interest rates also contributed to the improvement in net investment income 
rates began to increase in mid  allowing new and maturing funds to be invested at higher rates 
our average income yield  on a consolidated basis  excluding ncric  was for as compared to for our average tax equivalent income yield on a consolidated basis  excluding ncric  was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  we increased the proportion of the portfolio that is invested in tax exempt securities because of the higher after tax yields available on these securities  therefore  our average after tax equivalent income yield improved more than our average income yield 
the components of net realized investment gains losses are shown in the following table 
year ended december in thousands net gains losses from sales other than temporary impairment losses trading portfolio gains losses net realized investment gains losses 
table of contents underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses are comprised of variable costs  such as commissions and premium taxes that are directly related to premiums earned  and fixed costs that have an indirect relationship to premium volume  such as salaries  benefits  and facility expenses 
our underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses reflect higher compensation and benefit costs offset by a decrease in variable costs due to lower premium volume 
the slight upward shift of the expense ratio as compared to is principally due to the increase in compensation costs 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses expense ratio year ended december year ended december increase increase decrease decrease in thousands pra  prior ncric   n a n a continuing operations guaranty fund assessments were approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to approximately  for the year ended december  interest expense interest expense increased in as compared to primarily because the average amount of debt outstanding was higher in and because interest rates increased in in the early part of  our only outstanding debt was our convertible debentures 
in april and may of we issued our subordinated debentures of million  we added the debentures of million in august as a part of the ncric transaction 
our convertible debentures have a fixed interest rate  our subordinated debentures have variable rates 
taxes our effective tax rate for each period is significantly lower than the statutory rate because a considerable portion of our net investment income is tax exempt 
the effect of tax exempt income on our effective tax rate is shown in the table below year ended december statutory rate tax exempt income resolution of tax contingencies other effective tax rate 
table of contents recent accounting pronouncements and guidance on december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment  hereafter referred to as sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which superseded apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
the provisions of sfas r require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas r also requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
we plan to adopt sfas r on january   the required effective date  using the modified prospective method permitted by the statement and will value future grants of stock options using the black scholes valuation method 
under the modified prospective method stock based compensation is recognized under the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date of sfas r and for the non vested portion of share based payments granted prior to the adoption of sfas r 
under sfas r compensation for non vested share based payments granted prior to adoption shall continue to be calculated as disclosed under sfas  except that the effect of forfeitures is required to be estimated rather than considered as forfeitures occur 
as permitted by sfas  we currently value employee stock based payments using apb s intrinsic value method 
accordingly  we generally recognize no compensation cost related to such payments but do provide pro forma disclosure of the effect on net income and earnings per share of applying the fair value provisions of sfas to such payments granted 
had our sfas pro forma disclosures been prepared in accordance with the provisions of sfas r the effect would have been different  however  the effect that sfas r would have had on prior periods is not readily determinable 
sfas r provides more extensive guidance than does sfas with regard to factors that should be considered in valuing share based payments 
under sfas  we utilized a single set of valuation assumptions for all employees 
under sfas r  entities are required to aggregate individual awards into relatively homogeneous groups with respect to exercise and post vesting employment termination behaviors 
in order to appropriately reflect differing exercise and post vesting employee termination behaviors  we anticipate aggregating prospective awards into groups consisting of senior executives  likely to exercise shortly after vesting  other senior executives and other employees 
additionally  under sfas r  fully vested awards granted to directors and awards that vest upon retirement granted to employees who are eligible for retirement will be expensed on the date of grant 
under sfas  we calculated compensation expense for pro forma disclosure without consideration of expected forfeitures 
unlike sfas  which permitted companies to reflect forfeitures as they occurred  sfas r requires companies to estimate forfeitures in determining the amount of compensation cost to recognize each period 
as a result  we will develop estimates of forfeitures during the requisite service periods and revise previous sfas calculations for known and expected forfeitures related to grants prior to the adoption of sfas r 
our own history with regard to the expected terms of employee stock awards is not sufficient to allow such assumptions to be developed statistically for most employee groups 
accordingly  for such groups  through december   we will apply the simplified method consistent with the guidance of sec staff accounting bulletin  ie  expected term vesting term original contractual term 
we are in the process of finalizing these assumptions  however  the selection of all assumptions is not complete 
presently  we estimate that the recognition of compensation cost  net of tax effects  for the non vested portion of share based payments granted prior to the adoption of sfas r will approximate million  net of related tax effects  during fiscal the further effect of adoption of sfas r on future operating results will depend on the levels of share based payments granted in the future  the groups of employees to whom the awards are granted  the number of awards granted to employees who are eligible for retirement  the terms of any future awards  as well as the final methods and assumptions used to determine the fair value of those share based payments 
the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  in may as a replacement of apb  accounting changes  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas applies to voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the 
table of contents requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  proassurance expects to adopt sfas on its effective date 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  selected consolidated financial data for each period is summarized in the table below 
year ended december increase decrease in thousands revenues gross premiums written net premiums written premiums earned premiums ceded net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains losses other income total revenues expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses reinsurance recoveries net losses and loss adjustment expenses underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses loss on early extinguishment of debt interest expense total expenses income from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income net loss ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio operating ratio return on equity 
table of contents premiums written premiums exhibited strong growth in  however  the growth was at a slower pace than in primarily because we implemented smaller rate increases in as compared to our rates are based on our expected losses for the coverages provided  the cumulative effect of the rate increases we obtained in the past several years allowed us to pursue lower rate increases in some states in on average  renewals during the year ended december  were at rates that are approximately higher than expiring rates 
rate increases on renewals  on average  were at rates that were higher than expiring rates 
new business written in was largely offset by business that did not renew  including business that we selectively chose not to renew 
virtually all of the growth that we experienced in was related to physician coverages 
this growth included an increase of approximately million related to physician tail policies 
premiums written for this coverage can vary significantly from year to year 
earned premiums are earned pro rata over the entire policy period generally one year after the policy is written 
thus the increase in earned premiums reflects on a pro rata basis the changes in written premiums that occurred during both and ceded premiums ceded represent the portion of earned premiums that we must ultimately pay to our reinsurers for their assumption of a portion of our losses 
in both and  we reduced our estimates of prior year gross losses 
as a result of the features of our reinsurance contracts  we also reduced our estimates of ultimate ceded premiums 
the reduction was million in and million in premiums ceded were also reduced by million in due to the commutation of certain reinsurance contracts 
also  insureds have purchased policies with coverage limits below our reinsurance attachment point 
we do not cede these premiums  and as a result  premiums ceded declined 
losses and loss adjustment expenses the following table summarizes net losses and net loss ratios for the years ended december  and by separating losses between the current accident year and all prior accident years 
the net loss ratios shown are calculated by dividing the applicable net losses by calendar year net premiums earned 
net losses net loss ratios year ended december year ended december increase increase decrease decrease in thousands calendar year current accident year prior accident year net losses as specified divided by net premiums earned 
during  we continued to see an increase in loss severity  which increased loss costs 
current accident year net loss ratios are lower in than in primarily because loss costs increased at a slower pace than premium rates 
loss ratios have also improved because we converted our occurrence policies to claims made coverage 
generally  loss ratios associated with claims made coverage are initially lower than those associated with occurrence coverage 

table of contents we decreased our estimate of prior year net losses by million in and  in the amount represents of net reserves 
these adjustments were in response to actuarial evaluations of loss reserves performed during the period 
no change was made to our estimates of the reserves required for death  disability and retirement during or gross losses and reinsurance recoveries the following table reflects our losses on both a gross and a net basis 
gross and net losses year ended december increase decrease in thousands gross losses reinsurance recoveries net losses in  as was also the case in  our actuarial analysis of our reserves indicated that our claims severity had continued to increase as expected in our retained layers 
however  we did not experience the high level of losses in our reinsured layers that we originally anticipated and for which we established reserves 
accordingly  we reduced our estimates of prior accident year gross losses by approximately million during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december  these losses were heavily reinsured  therefore  we reduced expected reinsurance recoveries by million in and million in as previously discussed  these changes to prior year estimates reduced net losses by million in and nominally reduced net losses in in both and  the decrease to reinsurance recoveries for prior accident years more than offset reinsurance recoveries for current accident years resulting in a non traditional relationship between gross losses and recoveries 
assumptions used in establishing our reserves are regularly reviewed and updated by management as new data becomes available 
any adjustments necessary are reflected in current operations 
due to the size of our reserves  even a small percentage adjustment to the assumptions can have a material effect on our results of operations for the period in which the change is made 
net investment income and net realized investment gains losses the increase in our net investment income in as compared to is due to higher average invested funds in  offset by a slight decline in the yield of our fixed maturity securities 
while prevailing market interest rates have remained historically low  changes in the duration and asset mix of the portfolio have helped to stabilize the yield of the portfolio 
we increased the weighted average duration of the portfolio from years at december  to years at december  in order to take advantage of improved yields on certain longer term securities 
we have also increased the proportion of the portfolio that is invested in tax exempt securities because of the higher after tax yields available on these securities 
however  we continued to see some decline in our income yields as older  higher yielding securities matured or were sold 
our average income yield  on a consolidated basis  was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  our average tax equivalent income yield on a consolidated basis was for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  
table of contents the components of net realized investment gains are shown in the following table 
year ended december in thousands net gains losses from sales other than temporary impairment losses trading portfolio gains losses net realized investment gains losses underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses are comprised of variable costs  such as commissions and premium taxes that are directly related to premiums earned  and fixed costs that have an indirect relationship to premium volume  such as salaries  benefits  and facility costs assessments 
underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses increased in principally due to additional commission expense incurred as a result of premium growth 
changes in the mix of premiums by state and coverage type also increased commission expense 
we also experienced increases in costs for salaries  benefits and professional fees  most significantly those fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance 
the expense ratio underwriting  acquisition and insurance expenses divided by net premiums earned increased slightly in to as compared to in the increase is principally attributable to higher commission costs 
guaranty fund assessments were approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to approximately  for the year ended december  interest expense interest expense increased in as compared to primarily because the average amount of debt outstanding was higher in but also because interest was paid at a higher rate in the first half of as compared to the first half of in the first half of our only debt was an outstanding bank term loan 
in july we issued million of convertible debentures at a fixed rate of and repaid a million bank term loan which carried a variable rate 
we increased our debt again in april and may of  when we issued subordinated debentures of million 
taxes our effective tax rate for each period is significantly lower than the statutory rate because a considerable portion of our net investment income is from tax exempt interest and dividends 
the effect of tax exempt income on our effective tax rate is shown in the table below year ended december statutory rate tax exempt income resolution of tax contingencies other effective tax rate 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that we are principally exposed to three types of market risk related to our investment operations 
these risks are interest rate risk  credit risk and equity price risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   our fair value investment in fixed maturity securities was billion 
these securities are subject primarily to interest rate risk and credit risk 
we have not and currently do not intend to enter into derivative transactions 
interest rate risk our fixed maturities portfolio is exposed to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
as interest rates rise  market values of fixed income portfolios fall and vice versa 
we believe we are in a position to keep our fixed income investments until maturity as we do not invest in fixed maturity securities for trading purposes 
portfolio change in effective portfolio effective value value duration value duration interest rates millions millions years millions years basis point rise basis point rise current rate basis point decline basis point decline current rates are as of december  and at december   the fair value of our investment in preferred stocks was million  including net unrealized gains of thousand 
preferred stocks are primarily subject to interest rate risk because they bear a fixed rate of return 
the investments in the above table do not include preferred stocks 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of fixed income security assets  and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of the fair value of fixed rate instruments 
actual values may differ from those projections presented should market conditions vary from assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of individual securities  including non parallel shifts in the term structure of interest rates and changing individual issuer credit spreads 
proassurance s cash and short term investment portfolio at december  was on a cost basis which approximates its fair value 
this portfolio lacks significant interest rate sensitivity due to its short duration 

table of contents credit risk we have exposure to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities 
we control this exposure by emphasizing investment grade credit quality in the fixed income securities we purchase 
as of december   of our fixed income portfolio consisted of securities rated investment grade 
we believe that this concentration in investment grade securities reduces our exposure to credit risk on these fixed income investments to an acceptable level 
however  in the current environment even investment grade securities can rapidly deteriorate and result in significant losses 
equity price risk at december  the fair value of our investment in common stocks was million 
these securities are subject to equity price risk  which is defined as the potential for loss in market value due to a decline in equity prices 
the weighted average beta of this group of securities is 
beta measures the price sensitivity of an equity security or group of equity securities to a change in the broader equity market  in this case the s p index 
if the value of the s p index increased by  the fair value of these securities would be expected to increase by to million 
conversely  a decrease in the s p index would imply a decrease of in the fair value of these securities to million 
the selected hypothetical changes of plus or minus do not reflect what could be considered the best or worst case scenarios and are used for illustrative purposes only
