under the terms of management service agreements  the company provides non clinical services  which include facilities  staffing  equipment lease and maintenance  marketing and administrative services to refractive and secondary care practices in return for management fees 
for third party payor programs and corporations with arrangements with tlcvision  the company s management fee and the fee charged by the surgeon are both discounted in proportion to the discount afforded to these organizations

management fees are equal to the net revenue of the physician practice  less amounts retained by the physician groups 
included in costs of revenue are the laser fees payable to laser manufacturers for royalties  doctors compensation  use and maintenance of the lasers  variable expenses for consumables and facility fees  as well as center costs associated with personnel  facilities and depreciation of center assets

developments during fiscal acquisitions and divestitures on july   the company acquired substantially all the assets of kremer laser eye kremer 
kremer operates three refractive centers and one ambulatory surgery center all of which are located in the northeastern part of the united states 
for over years  kremer has been an integrated eye care company providing refractive  cataract and glaucoma surgery services 
the acquisition of kremer expands the company s presence in both the refractive and asc businesses in one of the largest populated markets in the united states 
the purchase price for the acquired assets was million 
in addition  the company assumed certain liabilities and incurred transaction costs of million 
simultaneously with this transaction  the company sold an interest in kremer to a group of doctors associated with kremer for million 
as a result  the company maintains an ownership interest in kremer 
on december   the company acquired a interest in liberty eye surgical center  llc liberty for million in cash 
liberty is an ambulatory surgery center located in philadelphia  pennsylvania that primarily provides cataract surgery services 
on november   the company acquired truvision  inc truvision for million in cash and  shares of company common stock valued at approximately  coupled with a three year earn out

critical accounting policies impairment of goodwill the company accounts for its goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  which requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
sfas requires the company to determine the fair value of its reporting units 
because quoted market prices do not exist for the company s reporting units  the company uses the present value of expected future cash flows to estimate fair value 
management must make significant estimates and assumptions about future conditions to estimate future cash flows 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  including general economic and competitive conditions  the company may be required to record impairment charges related to these assets 
impairment of long lived assets the company accounts for its long lived assets in accordance with sfas  which requires the company to assess the recoverability of these assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived asset group might not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators exist  the company determines whether the projected undiscounted cash flows will be sufficient to cover the carrying value of such assets 
this requires the company to make significant judgments about the expected future cash flows of the asset group 
the future cash flows are dependent on many factors including general and economic conditions and are subject to change 
a change in these assumptions could result in material charges to income 
recoverability of deferred tax assets the company has generated deferred tax assets and liabilities due to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the income tax bases of such assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of the valuation allowances  the company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
at december   the company had valuation allowances of million to fully offset deferred tax assets of million 
the valuation allowance was based on the uncertainty of the realizability of certain deferred tax assets 
in the event the company determines it is more likely than not it will be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  the valuation allowance would be reduced  thereby increasing net income  reducing goodwill or increasing equity in the period such determination was made 
accrual of medical malpractice claims the nature of the company s business is such that it is subject to medical malpractice lawsuits 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  the company maintains insurance in the united states for individual malpractice claims with a deductible of  per claim and a total annual aggregate deductible of million 
management and the company s insurance carrier review malpractice lawsuits for purposes of establishing ultimate loss estimates 
the company has recorded reserves to cover the estimated costs of the deductible for both reported and unreported medical malpractice claims incurred 
the estimates are based on the average monthly claims expense and the estimated average time lag between the performance of a procedure and notification of a claim 
if the number of claims or the cost of settled claims is higher than the company s historical experience or if the actual time lag varies from the estimated time lag  the company may need to record significant additional expense

recent developments on february   occulogix announced that it had completed a preliminary analysis of the data from mira  its recently completed pivotal phase iii clinical trial using its rheo tm system 
the data indicated that mira did not demonstrate a statistically significant mean change of best spectacle corrected visual acuity 
as a result of this announcement  the share price of occulogix stock as traded on the nasdaq national market system decreased from on february  to close at on february  the day average price of the stock immediately following the announcement was and reflected a decrease in the market capitalization of occulogix from million on february  to million based on the day share price average subsequent to the announcement 
the resulting decrease in the share price was identified as an indicator of impairment leading to an analysis of occulogix s intangible assets and goodwill and resulting in occulogix reporting an impairment charge to goodwill of million 
because tlcvision accounted for the occulogix reorganization at historical cost  it eliminates occulogix s goodwill balance in consolidation see note 
occulogix believes that the announcement made it unlikely that it would be able to collect on amounts outstanding from its sole customer  veris  resulting in a provision for bad debts of million related to revenue reported prior to december occulogix did not recognize million of revenue related to goods shipped in december  based on collectibility not being reasonably assured 
occulogix also fully expensed the million advance that it had paid to veris in connection with clinical trial services to be provided by veris for one of occulogix s clinical trials 
occulogix also evaluated its ending inventory balance as of december  on the basis that veris may not be able to increase its commercial activities in canada in line with initial expectations 
accordingly  occulogix set up a provision for obsolescence of million for filter sets that are unlikely to be utilized prior to their expiration dates
