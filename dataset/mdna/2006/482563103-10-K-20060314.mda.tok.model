item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this report for information regarding our revenues  profits and losses and total assets by business segment 
worksite insurance business our worksite insurance business is a provider of life and health insurance products to employers and their employees 
our predecessor s marketing and sales efforts were primarily in the southeastern united states  predominantly in florida  south carolina and north carolina 
since acquiring our predecessor  we have begun to implement our business strategy to market our products nationwide 
our worksite insurance business underwrites primary insurance products including life insurance  disability insurance  dental insurance  indemnity health insurance which provides benefits to cover many costs incurred upon the occurrence of an accidental injury or sickness  employer excess risk insurance and critical illness insurance 
our insurance products are marketed through an internal sales force and independent insurance agents to brokers  consultants  employers and other worksite producers 
most of our worksite insurance products are voluntary products  where the employer or association offers the products to its employees or members as part of an array of insurance and health benefits from which the employee or member may choose 
the individual employee or member elects which products to purchase and the premiums are paid by the employee or group member 
the employer will often deduct the premium from the employee s periodic paycheck and remit the premium to us 
some of our worksite marketing products are group products where the employer or association pays the premiums for insurance benefiting its employees or members as part of the employee s or member s compensation package 
our employer excess risk insurance is sold exclusively to employers who self fund health benefits 
most of the insurance products offered by our worksite insurance business are underwritten by us and the primary underwriting risk under the policies is retained by us 
some of the insurance products marketed by us are underwritten by other insurance companies who retain the underwriting risk 
we refer to insurance products underwritten by other carriers  but sold by us  as in sourced products 
our worksite insurance business is licensed to offer group and individual life and health insurance products in states 
the earnings reported in any period for our worksite insurance business generally depends on growth in underwritten business  business mix  persistency of business in force  benefit payouts and administrative expenses incurred 
worksite insurance products the primary insurance products that we underwrite include the following voluntary life insurance 
voluntary life insurance insures the life of a single individual 
it is typically sold on a renewable term basis or with a cash value component such as whole life insurance 
group life insurance 
group life insurance insures the lives of a group of individuals and pays benefits upon the death of each member within the group 
the group typically is comprised of an entire employer workforce or other class of covered individuals 
disability insurance 
disability insurance protects against the loss of wages due to illness or accidental injury 
disability insurance generally provides income replacement on a weekly or monthly basis while disabled 
dental insurance 
dental insurance generally covers all or a portion of the costs of diagnostic and preventative dental and orthodontic services 
it generally is offered on a voluntary basis and provides benefits on a reimbursement basis 
critical illness insurance 
critical illness insurance is designed to fill financial gaps not covered by health  disability  life and accident insurance policies when insureds are diagnosed with a critical illness 
indemnity health insurance 
indemnity health insurance provides benefits to cover many costs incurred upon the occurrence of an accidental injury or sickness 
employer excess risk insurance 
employer excess risk insurance provides insurance protection to employers who self fund a portion or all of employee health benefits 
in addition to marketing the products discussed above  our worksite insurance business works with each employer or association to assess its unique insurance requirements and to create a customized  bundled package of insurance products and services designed to meet those requirements 
the package may consist of insurance products and services offered by our worksite insurance business and or in sourced products underwritten by other insurance carriers 
marketing and distribution most of the products sold by our worksite insurance business are sold to individuals through their employer or other group of which they are a member 
this is a marketing and distribution effort that we refer to as worksite marketing 
worksite marketing sales generally have two components group products  where the employer or association pays the premiums for insurance that covers the employee or member as part of the employee s or member s compensation package  and voluntary individual products  where the employee or member elects to purchase supplemental coverage and or additional insurance products not sponsored by the employer or association  and the employee or member pays the premiums  which are often deducted from the employee s or member s pay and submitted to the insurance company by the employer or association 
most of our worksite insurance products are sold as voluntary products  however some are sold as employer paid group products 
prior to our acquisition of kanawha  the majority of our worksite marketing business was marketed through independent insurance agents 
since the acquisition  we have been developing an internal sales force that markets our worksite products nationwide to larger employers and groups 
both the independent agents and our internal sales force call on employers  consultants  brokers and other intermediaries that arrange to present product offerings to sponsoring employers or groups located throughout the united states 
in general  intermediaries involved in placing our worksite products with employers or groups receive a brokerage commission and or other fee arrangement which is a percentage of gross premiums generated from the placement 
our worksite marketing business currently uses independent agents to target small employers and groups generally having fewer than individual employees or members and our internal sales force to target larger employers and groups with to  employees 
worksite insurance competition we face competition from many firms in the life and health insurance industry  but we believe a limited number of companies participate in the market in the same manner as we do 
we view the worksite marketing segment of the life and health insurance business as being composed of three different types of companies companies selling primarily group insurance products  companies selling primarily voluntary insurance products and companies offering both group and voluntary insurance products  but through separate distribution channels 
we believe that most insurers competing in the worksite market tend to focus on either the group market or the voluntary market  with very few competitors focused on offering both group and voluntary products through the same sales organization  which is how we operate 
we believe the fastest growth in the worksite insurance market in the future will be achieved by those insurers offering both group and voluntary products where cross selling and product packaging opportunities are significant 
our competitors in the worksite insurance market include aflac  inc  stancorp financial group  inc  unumprovident corp  transamerica corporation  metropolitan life insurance company  american fidelity life insurance company  prudential financial  inc  assurity life insurance company  ing groep nv  jefferson pilot corporation and allstate financial 
other commercial competitors that offer various products in the worksite insurance market that do not easily fit into any one of these categories include various small and medium sized life insurance companies 
in the worksite insurance market  competition tends to focus more on the distribution channel 
competition in the worksite insurance market is based primarily on product mix  service and pricing 
we believe that there are a limited number of competitors that offer both group and voluntary insurance products to the worksite insurance market through the same sales force 
examples of such carriers include john hancock financial services  inc  mutual of omaha and state farm life insurance company 
senior market insurance business our senior market insurance business has been a provider in the southeastern united states of individual insurance products tailored to the needs of older individuals 
the primary insurance products that this business has offered include long term care insurance that we underwrote and medicare supplement insurance underwritten by another carrier 
long term care insurance protects the insured from the costs of long term care services 
these services include nursing homes  assisted living facilities  adult day care and home health care 
our long term care insurance products were underwritten by us and we continue to bear the underwriting risk 
a portion of this risk is reinsured 
medicare supplement insurance provides coverage for medicare qualified expenses that are not covered by medicare because of applicable deductibles or maximum limits 
the medicare supplement insurance currently sold by us is underwritten by mutual of omaha which bears the underwriting risk 
our predecessor ceased underwriting its own medicare supplement insurance in  but medicare supplement insurance policies that it underwrote prior to are still in force 
on october   we sold our agency office in ft 
myers  florida that was primarily responsible for distributing our senior market insurance products 
in conjunction with the sale of the ft 
myers agency office  we decided not to actively underwrite long term care insurance policies after december  we intend to retain and actively manage the existing block of in force long term care insurance policies including the right to receive future premiums and the liability of future claims 
we also intend to continue offering  through our worksite distribution channel  medicare supplement insurance underwritten by another carrier 
significant factors that contributed to our decision to sell the ft 
myers  florida agency office and cease actively underwriting long term care insurance policies include  among others sales for this business were significantly lower than originally projected  and the lack of strategic fit between the underwriting and distribution of long term care products and our current strategy of focusing on worksite marketing of life and health insurance products 
third party administration business our third party administration business provides a wide range of insurance product administration  claims handling  eligibility administration  call center and support services 
this business primarily administers the insurance plans offered by our worksite insurance business and senior market insurance business including our existing in force policies 
our third party administration business also provides administrative and managed care services to third parties  such as employers with self funded health care plans  other insurance carriers  and managed care plans 
our third party benefits administration business focuses on three primary services insured products administration  self funded health care plan administration  and managed care services 
as of december   our third party administration business employed individuals 
based on revenues  our predecessor ranked in the top of the third party plan administrators that are members of the society of professional benefit administrators  or spba 
this ranking was based on spba s most recently released directory for insured products administration as of december   our third party administration business administered over  in force insurance policies  including a wide variety of voluntary  group and individual insurance and reinsurance products 
the primary responsibility of our third party administration business is to administer the products underwritten by our worksite insurance business and our senior market insurance business  and most of the products administered by the third party administration business are products underwritten by our insurance businesses 
in addition  the third party administration business administers various insurance products underwritten by other insurance companies  including metropolitan life insurance company  axa financial  inc  blue cross blue shield affiliates 
and several reinsurance companies 
the insurance products that our third party administration business administers include long term care insurance  group and individual life and health insurance  accident and health and cancer insurance and group and individual dental insurance 
the insurance administration services we provide include underwriting and policy issuance  claims management  reinsurance administration  and customer service and support 
self funded health care plan administration as of december   our third party administration business provides plan administration services for over  employees or members of employers or associations that self insure their health care benefits 
we administer preferred provider organization plans  point of service plans  health maintenance organization plans  indemnity plans and other healthcare plans provided by independent organizations as well as plans provided by our worksite insurance business and senior market insurance business 
the self funded health plan administration services provided include claims administration  eligibility administration  call center administration  design and coordination for customized plans  administration of health reimbursement accounts  or hras  which are employer funded accounts provided to employees for reimbursement of qualifying medical expenses and the reimbursements are excludable from employee gross income  and administration of dental and short term disability insurance plans 
managed care services our third party administration business also provides managed care services through our own proprietary provider network of over  providers  with over leased networks nationwide and our utilization review accreditation commission  or urac  accredited medical management unit 
the managed care programs and services we provide include utilization and case management a process through which an insurer assesses  plans  implements  coordinates  monitors and evaluates options and services to meet an individual s health needs using communication and available resources to promote quality care and cost effective outcomes and outpatient review  maternity management  disease management a system of coordinated healthcare intervention and communication for patients with conditions in which the patients typically take a significant role in their own care  data aggregation and predictive modeling  and on site and hour nurse triage 
these programs are administered by a medical management staff of nurses and a medical director 
third party administrative services competition the third party administrative services business tends to be highly competitive and highly fragmented 
there are a number of third party administration firms which compete primarily on the basis of service  efficiency and cost 
these competitors range from small local firms to large national firms and include a number of third party divisions of insurance companies and general agencies 
our administrative services business also competes indirectly in certain services provided by general outsourcing firms 
in some cases  third party administration platforms of larger  well established companies may have substantially greater financial  management and marketing resources than our third party administration business 
however  we view our third party administration business as an integral complementary component of our worksite marketing product strategy going forward and also believe that our additional resources resulting from our initial public offering in december will enhance our ability to obtain additional third party administrative service business 
acquired business our predecessor obtained over time  through assumption and indemnity reinsurance transactions  a number of blocks of life and health insurance business in which it has since elected to discontinue accepting new business 
revenue from this business reflects renewal premiums and other considerations on business in force that will continue to decline over time as policies lapse 
the earnings generated by acquired blocks of business in any period will be affected by  among other things  historical pricing levels together with approved premium rate increases if any  diversification of the underlying insurance policies  persistency and loss frequency and severity 
corporate and other the corporate and other segment includes investment income earned on the investment portfolio related to capital and surplus not allocated to the insurance segments 
this segment also includes marketing allowances  commissions and related expenses pertaining to product sales for other insurance carriers  which are currently not material 
in addition  this segment includes certain unallocated expenses  primarily deferred compensation and incentive compensation costs  and other unallocated immaterial items 
the results of this business segment are reflected in discussions of net investment income  realized investment gains and losses  and general insurance expenses 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
customers we have many customers that purchase our insurance products  and we are not dependent on any single customer  or group of customers in any of our business segments 
no single customer represents more than ten percent of our total consolidated revenue 
longstanding relationships exist with many customers who purchase products on a recurring basis  and we continually attempt to maintain and improve these relationships 
the loss of business from these customers or an increase in business from these customers could have a significant impact on the results of our operations 
competitive factors we believe that the factors that enable us to compete effectively include an experienced management team and an entrepreneurial culture 
we have a talented and experienced management team both at the holding company level and at each of our operating businesses 
our management team is led by our chairman  president and chief executive officer  kenneth u 
kuk  who has years of experience in the life insurance industry 
stanley d 
johnson has been the chief executive officer of kanawha since and is a member our board of directors 
members of our executive management team have an average of over years of experience in the life and health insurance industry  including experience in the areas of executive management  underwriting  marketing  distribution  claims processing  actuarial  legal  finance and investments 
we believe this experience is useful in executing our business strategy to grow our own nationwide worksite marketing operation and marketing our insurance products nationwide 
we promote a set of corporate values and a common corporate culture that we believe enables us to take advantage of business ideas  risk management expertise and focus on regulatory compliance across our businesses 
we reward and encourage entrepreneurship at each business segment  in part with a performance based compensation system 
strong relationships with key clients  distributors and industry personnel 
our executive managers  senior executives and sales managers have strong relationships with existing and potential worksite market customers through the united states  which include employers  vbos  enrollment firms  internal wholesalers  employee benefit consultants and national and regional insurance brokers 
we believe that the strength of these distribution relationships enables us to market our products and services in an effective and efficient manner and will be instrumental in our nationwide worksite marketing 
a broad product mix of both voluntary and group insurance products offered through an integrated distribution platform 
we offer a variety of products that meet the needs of group and voluntary customers throughout various stages of their development and lifecycles 
we have the capability to package our insurance products  insurance products from other carriers and administrative services options as a total solutions package to our clients and customers 
we do not believe this can be duplicated easily by our competitors 
we believe our insurance operations combined with products in sourced from other carriers and administrative services options provided by our third party administration business provide the foundation for significant product cross selling and product extension opportunities 
we believe that persistency and profitability are enhanced by offering a wide variety of insurance products to group and voluntary customers 
strong administrative capabilities in third party administration 
our third party administration business provides plan administration services for over  employees or members of employers or associations that self fund their healthcare benefits 
we offer a flexible and broad suite of administrative services and products that can be highly customized to provide tailored solutions to customers 
we intend to significantly expand our strong regional third party administration business as it administers the increasing volume of policies and products that we anticipate will be sold by our worksite insurance business 
a disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management 
we have implemented a disciplined underwriting and risk management policy 
we focus on generating profitability through careful analysis of risks and draw on our experience in core specialized markets 
we closely monitor regulatory and market developments and adapt our approach as we deem necessary to achieve our underwriting and risk management goals 
for example  we have exited products in which we were not achieving acceptable profitability or that do not fit with our worksite marketing strategy and we intend to introduce new products in insurance environments that are more favorable 
our worksite and third party administration businesses offer a diverse mix of products and services throughout the united states 
these products and businesses generally are not affected in the same way by economic and operating trends  which we believe allows us to maintain a greater level of financial stability than many of our competitors across business and economic cycles 
we expect our product and geographic diversity to further increase as we continue to implement our business strategy by expanding our product mix and implementing our nationwide marketing effort 
we are focused on loss containment  and we purchase reinsurance as a risk management tool to diversify our risk and protect against unexpected catastrophic events 
excellent financial strength 
as of december   we had approximately million of total assets and approximately million of shareholders equity 
kanawha  our insurance subsidiary  has financial strength ratings of a excellent from am best and a strong from s p  both with a stable outlook 
these ratings reflect each rating agency s current opinion of kanawha s financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders and contract holders 
we employ a conservative investment policy and our portfolio primarily consists of high grade  fixed income securities 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash and investments  consisting primarily of investment grade bonds with an average rating of aa 
we believe our solid capital base and overall financial strength allow us to distinguish ourselves from our competitors and enable us to attract clients that are seeking an insurance company with long term financial stability 
business strategy our objective is to transform our historical position as a regional voluntary life and health insurance company into a national life and health insurance company with an expanded product mix and nationwide marketing focus 
we intend to achieve this objective by executing the following strategies in pursuit of profitable growth expand our experienced management team 
we continue to hire personnel with a significant amount of experience in the life and health insurance industry  particularly with experience in key areas within the organization 
we believe this diverse experience is useful in executing our business strategy to quickly grow our own national worksite operation 
develop a nationwide marketing organization primarily focused on worksite marketing 
we believe that one of our critical success factors is to build a national sales and marketing organization that is focused on the worksite market 
we believe the creation of such an organization  combined with implementation of our product development strategy  is the foundation for our growth plan 
to implement our strategy to grow our worksite marketing operation we are taking the following actions continue to hire employees with worksite marketing sales experience 
we intend to continue to recruit additional insurance executives with experience in marketing worksite products to sponsoring employers and third parties including vbos  enrollment firms  internal wholesalers  employee benefit consultants  brokers and other parties 
as part of our strategy to expand our product mix and to expand our geographic coverage of our sales and marketing efforts  we have hired and intend to continue hiring individuals who have experience with the new products that we intend to introduce and with customer relationships in the new geographic areas that we are targeting 
target larger employers nationwide 
our new and expanding internal sales force is targeting employers with to  employees 
this target market includes over  businesses in the united states according to dun bradstreet 
historically  our predecessor concentrated on employers having less than individual employees 
we believe that with our enhanced marketing organization and expanding sales force  we are well equipped and will become even better equipped to serve larger employer sponsor groups 
targeting larger employers or groups with larger numbers of employees or members should enable us to sell more insurance premiums with lower sales  marketing  administrative and other overhead costs per premium dollar  which should improve our profit margins on worksite insurance products 
offer performance based equity compensation incentives 
we offer performance based equity compensation incentives for our sales and marketing employees that emphasize profitability  sales volume  cross selling our products and services and bundling packages of the products that we market 
these incentives include equity incentive awards  such as awards of options to purchase our common stock 
generally  our competitors do not offer similar broad based equity incentive awards  which gives us an advantage in continuing to hire and retain talented sales and marketing personnel 
we believe that offering performance based equity incentives increases our sales and profitability by aligning the interests of our marketing employees with our sales and profitability objectives 
collaborate with key third parties 
we have begun and will continue to seek to hire senior sales management professionals who have experience interacting with the many constituencies involved in our product distribution efforts 
we believe that it is important to our success that senior sales management interact with our sales force  sponsoring employers  benefit advisors and other product intermediaries and independent agents 
we believe relationships between these parties  as well as with our insurance businesses and our third party administration business  can be expanded to enhance our product packaging capabilities and cross selling abilities  including the bundling of insurance and related products and services from our insurance businesses  our third party administration business and other insurance carriers 
target specific market niches for small employers nationwide 
historically  our predecessor targeted small employers and groups in the southeastern united states generally having less than individual employees or members through a network of independent agents 
we are growing our presence in this niche market by expanding the geographic focus of our independent sales agents to focus on select markets nationwide 
expand the types and varieties of insurance products and related services that we offer 
in addition to developing a more effective marketing organization  we are focusing on our product development and offering strategy 
we believe that it is not only the individual products that we offer that differentiate us from our competition in the worksite insurance market  but also the breadth of our product mix 
our objective is to expand our existing product mix and add complementary products that together will provide a product offering that cannot easily be duplicated by our competitors 
this differentiated product set should allow our sales force the ability to offer our employer sponsors and our distribution partners bundled packages of multiple insurance products and services that are tailored to meet our customers unique needs 
our strategy for increasing our product mix includes the following provide additional group and voluntary insurance products 
we intend to expand our product offerings by offering additional types of worksite life and health insurance products as well as additional variations of the types of insurance that we currently offer 
in sourced product offerings 
we believe that expanding the variety of in sourced products that we market is necessary to accomplish our goals of expanding our product mix and marketing customized bundled product packages tailored to a customer s needs 
as we continue to seek to grow our product mix  bundled solutions and geographic marketing scope  there will be instances where potential customers have needs that we cannot satisfy with products underwritten by our insurance businesses 
develop client focused strategy 
we believe that long term success in the worksite market is predicated on a client driven strategy often missing in the market today 
we focus on the unique requirements of sponsoring employers and worksite intermediaries 
to satisfy our customers individual insurance requirements  we are working to offer more bundled packages of multiple insurance products and services that are tailored to meet our customers needs 
these bundled solutions are to be marketed by our internal sales force and independent agents and will include both group policies as well as voluntary policies traditionally marketed by independent agents 
many of these bundled solutions will utilize products and services provided by both our worksite marketing business and our third party administration business 
for example  we can provide a full insurance solution for an employer that is self insuring its employees by bundling administration and claims handling services relating to the self insured plan  a medical stop loss product which caps our clients self insured exposure  group and voluntary insurance product offerings underwritten by us as part of an employee benefit package  and insurance products from other insurance carriers structured to fulfill group and voluntary insurance product needs that we do not underwrite ourselves 
improve the efficiency of our third party administration business 
our business strategy is to grow our third party administration business primarily by having it administer the increasing volume of policies and products that we anticipate will be sold by our worksite insurance business 
we believe that our third party administration business has the capacity to administer additional policies and that as this business administers a higher volume of policies  our per policy administration costs will decrease and our consolidated net profits will increase 
we have undertaken several initiatives to improve our use of technology in that are directly aimed at reducing our administrative costs and becoming more efficient in providing both enrollment and policy maintenance services 
while increasing the volume of insurance products administered for unrelated third parties will not be a primary growth initiative for this business  as our national worksite marketing business develops we intend to opportunistically market our third party administration services to other insurance carriers and reinsurers  as well as our traditional end client base  such as self insured plans  stop loss insurers  pharmacy benefit organizations and various managed care service providers 
improve capital management 
we intend to manage our capital prudently relative to our risk exposure to enhance risk adjusted returns on investments and long term growth in shareholder value 
our capital management strategy is to maintain financial strength through conservative and disciplined risk management practices 
we do this through product design  strong underwriting and risk selection and prudent claims management and pricing 
in addition  we maintain a conservative investment portfolio management philosophy and manage our invested assets so their maturities match the duration of our insurance product liabilities 
we manage our business segments so that they have the appropriate level of capital required to obtain the ratings necessary to operate in their markets and to satisfy various regulatory requirements 
we are also evaluating and implementing cost cutting measures in each of our business lines 
maintain a disciplined risk management approach 
we maintain a disciplined risk management approach through flexible underwriting and pricing strategies  diversification of products  industry  geography and customers and the use of reinsurance 
we are focused on profitable products and markets and a flexible approach to product design 
we have implemented a collaborative effort between our marketing and underwriting teams that we believe permits us to opportunistically take advantage of sales opportunities and underwrite profitable policies 
we continuously evaluate the profitability of our products and pursue pricing strategies and adjust our mix of business by geography and by product so that we can maintain attractive pricing and margins 
we seek to price our products at levels which help us achieve our target profit objectives 
pursue acquisitions opportunistically 
while our primary focus is organic growth of our existing businesses by expanding our product and marketing capabilities  we evaluate opportunities to grow through strategic alliances and acquisitions of blocks of business and or companies that are compatible with our core businesses 
risk management and underwriting we manage our risks through diversification of products  industry  geography and customers  disciplined underwriting and product pricing practices and the use of reinsurance 
to account for and manage our risks  we establish and carry as liabilities actuarially determined reserves that we believe will be sufficient to meet our future obligations 
diversification we diversify our earnings from premiums by offering a diverse set of voluntary life and health  indemnity health  critical illness  medicare supplement insurance  group life  long and short term disability  stop loss insurance and other coverages 
these products all have differing price  market and risk characteristics 
the underwriting risk on life insurance is generally diversified because covered lives of individuals are typically relatively independent of each other 
natural and man made catastrophes  such as terrorist attacks  are the one exception where numerous life insurance claims may occur at once 
geographic diversity of insureds is generally the best protection from such risks 
the recently enacted federal terrorism act that provides a backstop to the insurance industry excludes life insurance exposures 
in addition to the increased risk due to terrorism  there is significant risk from epidemics such as the avian bird flu  sars or west nile viruses or other diseases that can spread quickly around the world given the increasing levels of individual travel  commerce and interdependency between nations involved in a global economy 
we could be materially impacted by any one of these events if they were to strike a significant block of our insureds within a short period of time 
currently  our worksite products in force are predominantly spread among different employers throughout the southeastern united states  although we are actively marketing nationwide 
we will continue to monitor these macro issues on an ongoing basis and will evaluate concentrations of risk as part of our underwriting process to optimize the diversification of risk exposures 
our product and geographic diversification should improve as we implement our strategy to develop a nationwide worksite insurance business with expanded product offerings 
underwriting and pricing we manage the risk associated with the insurance policies that we place by implementing disciplined underwriting and product pricing practices that are tailored by product 
our group product underwriting and pricing is centralized 
we have developed standard rating systems for each product line based on past experience and relevant industry experience 
we are not obligated to accept any application for a policy or group of policies from any distributor and or worksite employer 
our uniform underwriting policies provide that if the coverage exceeds prescribed age and amount limits  we may require a prospective insured to submit to medical examinations 
product pricing of group insurance products is based on the expected payment of benefits under the policies that are calculated using assumptions for mortality  morbidity  interest  expenses and persistency  depending upon the specific product features 
our individual life and disability insurance underwriters follow detailed and uniform policies and procedures to assess and quantify the risk of our individual insurance products 
we may require the applicant to take a variety of underwriting tests  such as medical examinations  electrocardiograms  blood tests  urine tests  chest x rays and consumer investigative reports  depending on the age of the applicant and the amount of insurance requested 
in certain states  particularly florida  consistent with other carriers offering long term care insurance policies  our long term care insurance claims have exceeded those anticipated when our predecessor first priced the policies 
our cumulative claims experience for long term care products in the state of florida has been approximately higher than expected and approximately higher than our average claims rates for all other states in which we have long term care policies in force 
as a result  we have filed for and obtained rate increases in the range of to on policies in force in the majority of states in which we have long term care policies in force 
these rate increases have generally taken effect on each policyholder s next anniversary date 
rates for our newest generation of long term care policies are from to higher than for earlier generations 
we believe that the rate increases we have obtained on older generations should eventually bring their rates in line with the newest generation 
we intend to continue to monitor our long term care insurance in force and make further pricing adjustments to these policies as contractually permitted and as experience justifies  subject to receiving approval from state insurance departments 
while we can provide no assurance  we expect that actions already taken and which we foresee in the near future will allow us to improve the profitability of our long term care business 
reinsurance generally  we purchase reinsurance coverage for the following major business purposes protection from underwriting risks 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for some risks underwritten by us  such as excess of loss coverage for individual or group claims 
dispositions of insured business 
we use reinsurance to facilitate the sale or exit of product lines and or blocks of business 
this is common in the insurance industry because each insurer offers a distinct set of product lines  which complicates the acquisition and disposition of stand alone legal entities  and in certain cases  large blocks of insurance business 
in general  a disposition through a reinsurance transaction will include a co insurance agreement under which of the policy benefit reserves and related assets of the subject business will be transferred to the reinsurer 
also  given the fact that the primary insurer is still legally obligated under the policies reinsured  these agreements generally require some degree of credit support including bank letters of credit  reinsurer deposits with the reinsured party and trust agreements under which the assets backing the liabilities of the reinsured business are held in a trust along with excess collateral and the reinsurer is obligated to fund the trust if the value of the assets is deemed insufficient to fund the liabilities 
capital management 
we purchase reinsurance as a capital management tool 
state insurance regulations and accounting regulations permit us to reduce our required capital when underwriting risks are appropriately offset by reinsurance  which allows us to free up capital to enable us to write additional business 
reinsurance is either provided on a treaty basis or a facultative basis  and is generally structured in the proportional form or an excess of loss basis for both individual losses and losses in the aggregate 
in an indemnity reinsurance transaction offered on a treaty basis  a reinsurer agrees to indemnify another insurer for part or all of its liability under a policy or policies it has issued for an agreed upon premium 
these agreements provide for recovery of a portion of losses and associated loss expenses from reinsurers 
these losses and loss expenses refer to the expenses of settling claims  including legal and other fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs plus losses incurred with respect to claims 
the terms of these agreements  which are typical for agreements of this type  generally provide  among other things  for the automatic acceptance by the reinsurer of ceded risks in excess of our retention limits the amount of loss per individual or in the aggregate that we are willing to absorb 
for excess of loss coverage  we pay premiums to the reinsurers based on rates negotiated and stated in the treaties 
for proportional reinsurance  we pay premiums to the reinsurers based upon percentages of premiums received by us on the business reinsured and the reinsurer accepts a proportional percentage of the risk on the reinsured business 
these agreements are generally terminable as to new risks by us or by the reinsurer on appropriate notice  however  termination does not affect risks ceded during the term of the agreement  which generally remain with the reinsurer 
the other common form of reinsurance is referred to as facultative reinsurance in which a specific risk is insured  such as upon the cession of a specific portion of a large insurance policy 
in this form of reinsurance the reinsurer has the option to accept or decline the risk 
in most cases in which we choose to reinsure an underlying exposure  we expect to purchase reinsurance on a treaty basis and either in the form of proportional or excess of loss coverage  depending on the underlying properties of the insurance products 
in select cases  we may purchase reinsurance on a facultative basis in cases in which we have high exposures on specific individual insured risks 
our significant reinsurance includes the following individual and group life 
our predecessor reinsured its directly written in force individual life insurance policies on an excess of loss per risk and aggregate basis above identified retention limits 
this reinsurance was with subsidiaries of ge employers re and scottish re 
ge employers re notified our predecessor that  effective february   it no longer accepts new business under this treaty 
the treaty  however  remains in effect with respect to business previously reinsured under the treaty 
scottish re replaced ge employers re as the reinsurer for all new business 
we also reinsure much of our acquired individual life insurance policies with reassure america life insurance company a subsidiary of swiss re 
we reinsure our group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance policies with munich american reassurance corporation on an excess of retention basis 
individual and group worksite term life insurance life insurance written for a specified period and under which no cash value is generally available on surrender products are reinsured on a coinsurance basis with hannover re  which means that hannover re bears the risk for of any claims losses and costs incurred with respect to these policies 
we intend to continue to monitor our risk retention levels on our life insurance policies and will seek to maintain a reasonable balance between reinsured and retained risk 
group medical stop loss 
we reinsure our specific stop loss insurance policies with lloyd s of london syndicate on an excess of retention basis 
this treaty was effective june  the availability of reinsurance for aggregate stop loss insurance policies has significantly diminished as a result of significant market losses in recent years 
while we would prefer to retain reinsurance coverage for this business line at acceptable pricing levels  we are comfortable retaining full exposure on this product given our ability to manage the risk by setting appropriate attachment points  and our limited maximum liability of million per policy 
new group term life 
we reinsure our group term life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance policies sold to employers  and supplemental group term life and accidental death and dismemberment life insurance written for a specified period and under which no cash value is generally available on surrender with swiss re on an excess of retention basis 
these treaties were effective july  the group term life treaty includes an experience refund provision 
fixed annuity block 
our predecessor discontinued underwriting new fixed annuity products effective december   and we intend to in source these products from other life and health insurance carriers 
all in force deferred annuity products as of december   were ceded via a coinsurance agreement with madison national life insurance company  a subsidiary of independence holding company 
madison national assumed all product administration of this block of business in early all risks and profits generated by the reinsured business have been transferred to madison national  however  we are still liable on a primary basis for this business should madison national fail to honor its reinsurance obligations 
long term care 
we have reinsured of the risk on the earlier generations of our long term care insurance with employers re and genre on a quota share basis  which means that we are responsible for of all losses under these policies 
we have reinsured of the risk on our later generations of long term care product with munich american re on a quota share basis  which means that we are responsible for of all losses under these policies 
group critical illness 
in we began to offer new group critical illness products that are reinsured with hannover re on a quota share basis  which means that we are responsible for of all losses under these policies 
other miscellaneous blocks of business 
the availability of life and health reinsurance has significantly diminished as a result of the events of september   and other circumstances within the life and health reinsurance industry  as noted elsewhere in this report 
a number of our reinsurance agreements relating to major medical  indemnity health  accidental death and dismemberment and other insurance coverages have been recently cancelled by the reinsurers due to lack of volume of business submitted  and the reinsurers will not accept new business pursuant to these agreements 
while we would prefer to retain reinsurance coverage for certain of these business lines and other older and smaller blocks of business in the future at acceptable pricing levels  we are comfortable retaining full exposures in these areas given our view that the current pricing environment in the life and health reinsurance industry adequately covers the underwriting risk inherent in these products 
under reinsurance transactions in which we are the ceding insurer  we have retained primary liability for the underlying policy claims of the insured risks if the assuming company fails to meet its obligations 
to limit this risk  we have control procedures in place to evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure 
the selection of reinsurance companies is based on criteria related to solvency and reliability and  to a lesser degree  diversification 
at december   over of our reinsurance recoverables were due from reinsurers rated a or better by am best 
we now seek to purchase reinsurance from only those entities rated a or better by s p or am best and we regularly monitor collectibility of our reinsurance recoverables  making reserve provisions for amounts we consider potentially uncollectible and requesting collateral where necessary 
we apply the same financial analysis and approval processes to the selection of reinsurance and other financial protection counterparties as we do to the underwriting of our own primary insurance products 
our management intends to conduct ongoing reviews of the pricing and operational characteristics of each of the products offered by us  our current reinsurance agreements in force  acceptable risk retentions and reinsurance alternatives  and the availability and cost of reinsurance applicable to our products 
gross annualized premium in force  ceded portion and net amount retained the following table details our gross annualized premium in force segregated by product type  the portion that was ceded to reinsurers and the net amount retained as of december  as of december  gross ceded net percentage retained life insurance and annuities group life insurance group accident and health individual accident and health insurance total consolidated assumed reinsurance we have also assumed blocks of reinsurance on both an indemnity and assumption basis 
we do not currently intend to acquire additional blocks of reinsurance  but some of the reinsurance previously purchased by us remains in force and will affect our future earnings depending on the future experience of these blocks of business 
the most significant of these blocks of business include coverages for waiver of premium benefits associated with certain life policies underwritten by axa financial  inc  individual health insurance business from metropolitan life insurance company and life insurance business from ing groep nv other smaller life and accident and health insurance blocks of business were also assumed during the period through policy benefit reserves we establish and carry as liabilities  actuarially determined reserves that we believe will meet our future obligations 
in accordance with industry and accounting practices and applicable insurance laws and regulatory requirements  we establish policy benefit reserves to recognize our future benefit obligations for our in force life  disability and other related policies 
we base the amounts of these reserves on actuarially recognized methods using prescribed morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the united states  which we modify to reflect our actual experience when appropriate 
reserves also include claims and claims expenses the expenses of settling claims  including legal and other fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs reported but not yet paid  claims incurred but not reported and claims in the process of settlement 
policy benefit reserves  whether calculated under gaap or sap  do not represent an exact calculation of future policy benefits and expenses but are instead estimates made using actuarial and statistical procedures 
we cannot assure you that any such reserves will be sufficient to fund our future liabilities in all circumstances 
future loss developments could require reserves to be increased  which would adversely affect earnings in current and or future periods 
adjustments to reserve amounts may be required in the event of changes from the assumptions regarding future morbidity  the incidence of disability claims and the rate of recovery  taking into account the effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors  persistency  mortality  loss severity and the interest rates used in calculating the reserve amounts 
the reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements are calculated in accordance with gaap 
we regularly review and update policy benefit reserves  using current information 
any adjustments are reflected in current results of operations 
however  because the establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process  we cannot assure you that ultimate losses will not exceed existing reserves 
investments investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability 
for the year ended december   our net investment income was approximately million and our net realized gains on investments were approximately million  which collectively accounted for approximately of our total revenues during this period 
as of december   much of our investment portfolio consisted of fixed maturity securities  such as corporate and government bonds  united states treasury securities and asset backed debt securities  and less than of our investments were equity securities 
significant fluctuations in the fixed income market  such as changes in interest rates could impair our profitability  financial condition and or cash flows 
in addition  the natural volatility of claims may force us to liquidate securities prior to maturity  which may cause us to incur capital losses 
of our fixed maturity securities  as of december   were scheduled to mature in more than twelve months and had a weighted average interest rate of and were scheduled to mature in less than twelve months and had a weighted average interest rate of 
we have attempted to structure our investment portfolio so that its interest rate and maturity schedule is appropriately matched with our expected insurance liabilities to ensure that cash flows are available to pay claims as they become due 
we are modifying our asset liability matching strategy to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility and have engaged asset liability management specialists to manage our asset liability matching strategy 
however  these strategies will not be able to completely eliminate  and may fail to significantly reduce  the adverse effects of interest rate volatility  and we cannot precisely predict the timing and magnitude of all claims 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that significant fluctuations in the level of interest rates and the unforeseen timing and magnitude of claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio  primarily from our investments in corporate bonds and preferred stocks 
defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in investment losses 
further  the value of any particular fixed maturity security is subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of the issuer 
as of december   we held approximately million of fixed maturity securities  or approximately of the carrying value of our total invested assets at that date 
our fixed maturity portfolio also includes below investment grade securities  which comprised approximately of the carrying value of our total fixed maturity securities at december  these investments generally provide higher expected returns but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities 
a significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity securities portfolio could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our other than temporary impairment losses on available for sale securities were approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   less than of the carrying value of our total investments was invested in common stock  however  our predecessor had higher percentages of common stock in its portfolio in the past and we may increase the percentage of our portfolio that is invested in common stock in the future 
investments in common stock generally provide higher total returns  but present greater risk to preservation of principal than fixed income investments 
we have in the past invested  and we may in the future invest  in relatively illiquid securities including certain infrequently traded public fixed maturity securities  privately placed fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  policy loans  limited partnership interests and real estate investments 
these asset classes represented approximately of the carrying value of our total cash and invested assets as of december  if we require significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of our normal cash requirements  we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than we otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
our inability to quickly dispose of illiquid investments could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our investment committee  consisting of members of our senior management team  establishes our investment strategy  policies and guidelines for hiring external investment managers 
our management  with the assistance of external managers  implements our investment strategy 
the policies and guidelines set by our investment committee will specify minimum criteria on the overall credit quality  liquidity and risk return characteristics of our investment portfolio and include limitations on the size of particular holdings  as well as restrictions on investments in different asset classes 
the investment committee monitors our overall investment returns  reviews compliance with our investment guidelines and reports overall investment results to our board of directors on a quarterly basis 
management of our investment portfolio is a critical part of our business strategy and materially affects our profitability 
investment decision making is guided mainly by the nature and timing of our expected liability payouts  management s forecast of our cash flows and the possibility of unexpected cash demands such as unexpected insured losses 
however  to the extent our insurance liabilities are correlated with an asset class outside our minimum criteria  our investment guidelines allow us to deviate from those minimum criteria provided such deviations reduce overall risk 
our fundamental investment philosophy is to manage assets within our stated risk parameters to generate consistent levels of investment income with competitive risk adjusted returns over the long term 
in accordance with our investment strategy  we seek to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while generating above average returns on a risk adjusted basis  through a high quality  diversified portfolio  manage credit  interest rate  prepayment and market risks  mandate that our investment portfolio consist mainly of highly rated and liquid fixed income securities  with adequate diversification among asset classes  industry concentrations and individual issuers  and adhere to all applicable regulatory requirements and laws 
historically  we have not used financial futures  forwards  options  swaps or other derivative financial instruments 
without the approval of our board of directors  we will not purchase financial futures  forwards  options  swaps and other derivatives  except for purposes of hedging capital market risks or replication transactions  which are defined as a set of derivative and securities transactions that  when combined  produce the equivalent economic results of an investment meeting our minimum criteria 
regulation our insurance operations are subject to regulation and supervision in each state in which we conduct our insurance business 
we are regulated by the insurance department of south carolina  the state in which our insurance subsidiary is domiciled  and by the insurance department of each state in which we are licensed to sell insurance products 
at the present time  we are licensed to sell insurance products in states and we are an authorized reinsurer in the state of new york 
generally  state insurance departments have broad administrative powers to grant and revoke licenses to transact business  license agents  approve forms of insurance policies  regulate trade practices and market conduct  establish reserve requirements and permitted investments  make assessments for guaranty funds formed to compensate insured s of insolvent insurance companies and  in general  regulate all insurance activities 
state insurance laws and regulations also require insurance companies to file detailed reports on a statutory accounting basis with the state insurance departments where they do business 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report regarding statutory accounting principles  including differences between sap and gaap accounting 
state insurance departments may examine the business and accounts of an insurance company at any time 
under the rules of the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  and state laws  the insurance departments of one or more states examine an insurance company periodically  typically at three to five year intervals 
south carolina has enacted insurance holding company regulations that require our insurance subsidiary to be registered as a member of an insurance holding company system 
these regulations require  among other things  prior approval of an acquisition of control of a domestic insurer  some transactions between affiliates and the payment of extraordinary dividends or distributions 
in addition to state law  we are also subject to various federal laws and regulations affecting our business in the areas of health care  pension regulation  discrimination  financial services regulation  securities regulation  privacy laws  terrorism and federal taxation 
employees as of december   we had approximately employees  a significant number of which are based in our lancaster  south carolina facilities 
we plan to hire additional sales personnel and related employees to staff regional and field offices in select locations throughout the united states as we continue to develop our nationwide worksite marketing business 
we expect that we will continue to hire additional employees as we expand our business 
risks and uncertainties the information presented in items a and to this report is incorporated herein by reference 
environmental compliance we have invested  and we intend to invest  in real estate and maintain a mortgage loan portfolio 
as of december   of our investment assets were mortgage loans and we did not have any real estate investments  although we do own and occupy a group of buildings in lancaster  south carolina where our primary operations are located and an office building in fort mill  south carolina 
liability resulting from environmental problems at properties securing our mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments or other owned real estate may harm our financial strength and reduce our profitability 
under the laws of several states  contamination of a property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of the cleanup 
in some states  this kind of lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage against the property  which would impair our ability to foreclose on that property should the related loan be in default 
in addition  under the laws of some states and under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  under certain circumstances  we may be liable for costs of addressing releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances that require remedy at a property securing a mortgage loan held by us 
we also may face this liability after foreclosing on a property securing a mortgage loan held by us after a loan default 
under cercla and other applicable environmental laws  we will be liable for environmental conditions  damages and remediation of property owned by us  even if the liability arises from the actions or conduct of previous owners of the property  including the actions or conduct of kanawha prior to our acquisition of all of its capital stock 
although the former shareholders and optionholders of kanawha have agreed to indemnify us for some environmental losses we incur with respect to the real property that we acquired when we acquired kanawha  this protection is limited  and we will be exposed to liability for environmental conditions existing on real property prior to our acquisition of kanawha to the extent this liability exceeds such indemnification coverage or to the extent that we are not indemnified against this liability 
financial strength ratings ratings by independent agencies are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and will continue to be important to our ability to market and sell our products in the future 
rating organizations continually review the financial positions of insurers  including kanawha  our insurance subsidiary 
insurance companies are assigned financial strength ratings by independent rating agencies based upon factors relevant to policyholders 
ratings provide both industry participants and insurance consumers meaningful information on specific insurance companies and are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
kanawha is currently rated by am best and standard poor s 
am best maintains a letter scale rating system ranging from a superior to f in liquidation while s p maintains a letter scale rating system ranging from aaa extremely strong to r under regulatory supervision 
currently  kanawha has an am best financial strength rating of a excellent  with a stable outlook  which is the second highest of ten categories within the am best rating system and the lowest in the category excellent 
s p s current financial strength rating for kanawha is a strong  with a stable outlook  which is the third highest of nine categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers ie  a  a and a are strong 
the objective of am best s and s p s ratings systems is to assist policyholders and to provide an opinion of an insurer s financial strength  operating performance  competitive position and ability to meet ongoing obligations to its policyholders 
these ratings reflect the opinions of am best and s p of our ability to pay policyholder claims and are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any security  including our common stock 
these ratings are subject to periodic review by and may be revised upward  downward or revoked at the sole discretion of am best and s p 
administration we believe one of the factors that enables us to compete effectively against other worksite insurance providers is our third party administration business  which administers both our underwritten insurance products and products underwritten by other insurance companies 
we anticipate that for the foreseeable future  various administrative functions of ours will continue to be performed internally given our expertise in administrative services and relatively low cost operating locations in south carolina 
our predecessor entered into an agreement in to outsource a substantial portion of its information technology and document management functions to cgi information systems management consultants  inc  after giving consideration to the relative cost implications of retaining these functions internally or outsourcing them to a third party 
the term of this agreement is years  and it may be terminated by us without cause starting november upon six months notice and at any time upon days notice for cause that remains uncured 
we believe the combination of our internal administrative capabilities and our outsourced administrative functions will provide us with an optimal mix of flexibility and cost efficiencies 
trademarks and intellectual property as standard practice  we and our predecessor have obtained the legal protections believed to be appropriate for our intellectual property 
we do not believe any of our intellectual property rights are material to our business 
we are not aware of any legal proceedings that have been brought against us for infringement of intellectual property rights

risk factors 
you should consider the following risk factors in evaluating us  our business and an investment in our securities 
any of the following risks  as well as other risks and uncertainties  could harm our business and financial results and cause the value of our securities to decline 
the risks below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business 
risks relating to our business we rely on independent agents and brokers and on internal sales representatives to market many of our products  and an inability to attract or retain these independent agents and brokers or internal sales representatives could impair our ability to compete and market our insurance products and services 
we distribute most of our insurance products and services through a variety of distribution channels  including independent employee benefits specialists  brokers  benefit consultants  managing general agents  life agents  an internal sales force  association groups  and other third party marketing organizations 
while one of the primary objectives of our business strategy is to develop an internal sales force to market our worksite insurance products to large employers nationwide  we intend to continue kanawha s practice of using independent insurance agents and brokers to market worksite insurance products to small employers 
our relationships with these various distributors are significant both for our revenues and profits 
an interruption in  or changes to  our relationships with various third party distributors could impair our ability to compete and market our insurance products and services and materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have internal sales representatives whose roles in the distribution process vary by segment 
we depend in large part on our sales representatives to develop and maintain client relationships 
our inability to attract and retain effective sales representatives could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we depend on our key executives and sales staff 
we may not be able to hire and retain key employees or successfully integrate our new management team to fully implement our business strategy  which could delay or prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy and could significantly and negatively affect our business 
our success depends largely on our senior management 
while we already employ a number of key managers  we will need to attract additional managers for many of the product lines we intend to offer in order to fully implement our business strategy 
further  we must attract and retain additional experienced underwriters  actuarial staff and risk analysis and modeling personnel in order to successfully operate and grow our businesses 
the number of available  qualified personnel in the insurance and reinsurance industry available to fill these positions may be limited 
our inability to attract and retain these additional personnel or the loss of the services of any of our senior executives or key employees could delay or prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy and could significantly and negatively affect our business 
after our management team and other personnel are assembled  our ability to implement our business strategy will depend on their successful integration 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully integrate our executive or other personnel 
in addition  we may attempt to hire executives or other personnel  individually or in groups  from other companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry that may seek to retain  or prevent us from hiring  their executives and other personnel 
these companies may have agreements that restrict those persons from soliciting employees of these companies and working for competitors 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring any executives or other personnel who are subject to these restrictions or whose employer seeks to prevent us from hiring them or that we will not be subject to litigation or incur liabilities in connection with our hiring  or attempting to hire  such executives or other personnel 
we have employment agreements with most of our executive officers and certain key employees 
most of these agreements have terms of approximately three years 
generally  either the employee or we may terminate these agreements with or without cause subject to applicable severance provisions and restrictive covenants  including non compete and non solicitation provisions 
the financial strength of kanawha  our insurance subsidiary  is rated by am best and s p  and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease 
kanawha has an am best financial strength rating of a excellent  which is the second highest of ten categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers ie  a and a are excellent 
s p s current financial strength rating for kanawha is a strong  with a stable outlook  which is the third highest of nine categories and the lowest within the category based on modifiers ie  a  a and a are strong 
rating agencies review their ratings periodically and kanawha s current ratings may not be maintained in the future 
if kanawha s ratings are reduced from their current levels by am best or s p  or placed under surveillance or review with possible negative implications  our competitive position in the insurance industry could suffer and we may lose customers 
if our financial strength ratings are reduced  our cost of borrowing would likely increase  our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiary  ratings agencies also may publish credit ratings which reflect the opinions of rating agencies  such as s p  regarding our ability to repay our indebtedness for our company 
the credit ratings have an impact on the interest rates we pay on the money we borrow 
therefore  a downgrade in our credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the financial strength ratings of kanawha  our insurance subsidiary  are not evaluations for the benefit of investors in our common stock and are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold shares of our common stock 
the financial strength ratings of kanawha  our insurance subsidiary  reflect each rating agency s current opinion of kanawha s financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders and contractholders 
these factors are of concern to policyholders  contractholders  agents  sales intermediaries and lenders 
ratings are not evaluations for the benefit of investors in our common stock 
they are not ratings of our common stock and should not be relied upon when making a decision to buy  hold or sell our shares of common stock or any other security 
we may require additional capital in the future which may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital  we may not be able to fund our growth in accordance with our business strategy 
we may need to raise additional funds through financings in order to fully implement our business plan 
the subordinated promissory note we issued in connection with the acquisition of kanawha restricts our ability to incur additional debt because pursuant to the terms of the subordinated promissory note  kmg america may not incur additional debt unless  at the time the debt is incurred and after giving effect to such debt  a kmg america s ratio of debt to shareholders equity does not exceed and b kmg america s ratio of debt  less trust preferred securities  to shareholders equity does not exceed  and kmg america will be in default under the promissory note if kanawha incurs  guarantees or assumes debt or issues any capital stock having any preference over the kanawha capital stock held by kmg america 
the amount and timing of our capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover our losses 
in the future  we or our operating subsidiaries may enter into term or revolving credit facilities with one or more syndicates of lenders 
however  we currently have no commitment from any lender with respect to a credit facility 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we are able to raise capital through equity financings  the interest of holders of our common stock will be diluted  and the securities we issue may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to our common stock 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
if we are unable to implement our business strategy or operate our business as we currently expect  our growth and profitability will be adversely affected 
kmg america was formed in to acquire kanawha and to operate and grow kanawha s insurance and other related businesses 
we have limited name recognition or reputation in the insurance industry outside of kanawha s historic geographic market in the southeastern united states 
our business plan is to grow kanawha s worksite insurance marketing and distribution business into a national business targeting larger employers by hiring experienced sales personnel  marketing our products nationwide and introducing new life and health insurance products 
our ability to fully implement our business plan will be affected by market conditions  legislative and regulatory changes and other factors  many of which are beyond our control  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete this nationwide expansion 
businesses  such as ours  which are small and growing  present substantial business and financial risks and may suffer significant losses 
we have had to and must continue to hire and train many key employees and other staff  develop business relations  establish operating procedures  obtain additional facilities  implement new systems and complete other tasks necessary for the conduct of our intended business activities 
if we are unable to implement these actions in a timely and cost effective manner  our business  results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected 
as a result of industry factors or factors specific to us  we may have to alter our anticipated methods of conducting our business  such as the nature  amount and types of risks we assume 
we may be unable to accurately predict benefits  claims and other costs or to manage those costs through our loss limitation methods  which could result in our incurring greater claims losses than we anticipate 
our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting benefits  claims and other costs  including medical and dental costs  as well as the frequency and magnitude of claims on our disability and other coverages 
it also depends on our ability to manage future benefit and other costs through product design  underwriting criteria  utilization review or claims management our efforts to mitigate the extent of losses incurred by those insured under our policies and the corresponding benefit costs and  in health and dental insurance  negotiation of favorable provider contracts 
our ability to predict and manage costs and claims  as well as our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by changes in health and dental care practices  inflation  new technologies  the cost of prescription drugs  clusters of high cost cases  changes in the regulatory environment  economic factors  the occurrence of catastrophes  and numerous other factors affecting the cost of health and dental care and the frequency and severity of claims in all our business segments 
the judicial and regulatory environments  changes in the composition of the kinds of work available in the economy  market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs 
as a result of one or more of these factors or other factors  claims could substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we also may be limited in our ability to respond to such changes by insurance regulations  existing contract terms  contract filing requirements  market conditions or other factors 
our actual claims losses may exceed our reserves for claims  which may require us to establish additional reserves that may materially reduce our earnings  profitability and capital 
we maintain reserves to cover our estimated ultimate exposure for claims and claim adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred but not reported as of the end of each accounting period 
reserves  whether calculated under united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  or statutory accounting principles  or sap rules and procedures prescribed or permitted by state insurance regulatory authorities which  in general  reflect a liquidity  rather than going concern  concept of accounting  do not represent an exact calculation of exposure  but instead represent our best estimates  generally involving actuarial projections at a given time  of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known 
the adequacy of reserves is impacted by future trends in claims severity  frequency  judicial theories of liability and other factors 
these variables are affected by both external and internal events over which we have no control  such as changes in the economic cycle  emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability or the need for long term care services  emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or accommodation  inflation  judicial trends  legislative changes  and claims handling procedures 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
reserve estimates are refined as experience develops 
adjustments to reserves  both positive and negative  are reflected in the statement of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated 
because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses  we cannot assure you that our ultimate losses will not exceed existing claims reserves 
moreover  future loss development could require reserves to be increased  which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings in the periods in which such increases are made 
policy and claim reserves were million  and million and million as of december   and  respectively 
these reserves are reevaluated each year  and we have determined that they were adequate as of december   and no material adjustments for deficiencies were necessary 
we may incur losses if there are significant deviations from our assumptions regarding the period that our existing insurance policies will remain in force 
the prices and expected future profitability of our life insurance  long term care insurance  and group life and health insurance are based in part upon expected patterns of premiums  expenses and benefits  using a number of assumptions  including those related to persistency  which is the probability that a policy or contract will remain in force from one period to the next 
the effect of persistency on profitability varies for different products 
for most of our life insurance  group life and health insurance products  actual persistency that is lower than our persistency assumptions could have an adverse impact on profitability  especially in the early years of a policy or contract  primarily because we would be required to accelerate the amortization of expenses we deferred in connection with the acquisition of the policy or contract 
for our long term care insurance and some other health insurance policies  actual persistency that is longer than our persistency assumptions could have a negative impact on profitability 
if these policies remain in force longer than we assumed  we could be required to make greater benefit payments than we anticipated when we priced these products 
historically  as has generally been the case throughout the long term care insurance industry  we have been adversely affected by deviations from our assumptions about how many of our long term care insurance policies would remain in force from year to year 
more policies than expected have remained in force 
while this has increased premium income  it has also required higher reserves for anticipated future claims  the net effect of which has been to reduce profitability 
because our assumptions regarding persistency experience are inherently uncertain  reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate if actual persistency experience is different from those assumptions 
although some of our products permit us to increase premiums during the life of the policy or contract  we cannot guarantee that these increases will be sufficient to maintain profitability 
moreover  many of our products do not permit us to increase premiums or limit those increases during the life of the policy or contract 
significant deviations in experience from pricing expectations regarding persistency could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products 
we are incurring increased costs not incurred by our predecessor as a result of being a public company 
as a public company  we have incurred and will incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses that neither we nor our predecessor incurred as private companies prior to our initial public offering  including costs associated with our public company reporting requirements 
we are incurring costs associated with corporate governance requirements  including requirements under the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules implemented by the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange  because our common stock is listed on such exchange 
these rules and regulations are increasing our legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming and costly 
these rules and regulations may also make it more difficult for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  which may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers 
our future performance cannot be predicted based on the financial information included in our form k 
as a relatively newly formed company  whose insurance related operations did not commence until december   kmg america has a short operating history on which you can base an estimate of our future earnings prospects 
kanawha s business is intended to be only a portion of our consolidated business in the future and our predecessor s business is not representative of our primary business strategy 
as a result  the historical results of our predecessor presented in our form k are not comparable with or representative of the actual results that we expect to achieve once we fully implement our business strategy and will not be helpful in helping you make investment decisions with respect to shares of our common stock 
our services may expose us to professional liability in excess of our insurance coverage  which could cause us to incur material losses 
we may have liability to clients for errors or omissions in the services we perform 
these liabilities could exceed our insurance coverage and the fees we derive from those services 
we maintain general liability insurance  umbrella and professional liability insurance 
the cost of maintaining these insurance policies is rising 
we cannot assure you that this insurance will be sufficient to cover any liabilities we incur or that we will be able to maintain our insurance at reasonable rates or at all 
if we terminate our policies and do not obtain retroactive coverage  we will be uninsured for claims made after termination even if these claims are based on events or acts that occurred during the term of the policy 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage for the new services or areas into which we expand on favorable terms or at all 
our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets and affect our sales and profitability 
see investments of item of this report  incorporated herein by reference  for a discussion of the risk associated with our investment portfolio 
we may incur environmental liability as a result of our mortgage loan portfolio and real estate investments or as a result of our ownership of real property 
see environmental compliance of item of this report  incorporated herein by reference  for a discussion of the risk associated with our environmental liability 
the indemnification available to us under the kanawha purchase agreement may not be sufficient to cover all our losses  claims or liabilities arising from breaches of the purchase agreement 
the former shareholders and optionholders of kanawha have agreed to indemnify us for losses we incur as a result of breaches of the representations  warranties and covenants made by the former kanawha shareholders and optionholders in the purchase agreement pursuant to which we acquired all of the stock of kanawha 
however  there are significant limitations on this indemnification 
for example  some losses are not indemnifiable until they exceed a deductible of  and are not indemnifiable after they exceed indemnification limits  and our right to indemnification for most losses  claims or liabilities arising from breaches of the purchase agreement expires between june  and december  we cannot assure you that the indemnification available to us under the purchase agreement is sufficient to cover all losses  claims or liabilities arising from potential breaches of the representations  warranties and covenants made by the former kanawha shareholders and optionholders in the purchase agreement 
a failure to effectively maintain and modernize our information systems could cause us to experience adverse consequences  including inadequate information on which to base pricing  underwriting and reserving decisions  the loss of existing  or difficulties in attracting new  agents  brokers and customers  litigation exposure  or increases in administrative expenses  all of which could adversely affect our business 
our business depends upon our ability to remain current with technological advances 
this is particularly important in our administrative and managed care division  where our systems  including our ability to keep our systems fully integrated with those of our clients  are critical to the operation of our business 
our failure to update our systems to reflect technological advancements or to protect our systems may adversely affect our relationships and ability to do business with our clients 
in addition  our business depends significantly on effective information systems 
we will have to commit significant resources to maintain and enhance our existing information systems and develop new information systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences 
if we pursue acquisitions  we may acquire additional information systems 
our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems  or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if we do not maintain adequate systems we could experience adverse consequences  including inadequate information on which to base pricing  underwriting and reserving decisions  the loss of existing agents  brokers and customers  difficulty in attracting new agents  brokers and customers  customer  provider and agent disputes  regulatory problems  such as failure to meet prompt payment obligations  litigation exposure  or increases in administrative expenses 
in  a subsidiary of kanawha entered into an agreement to outsource a substantial portion of its information technology and document management functions to cgi information systems management consultants  inc cgi group 
the term of this agreement is years  and it may be terminated by kanawha s subsidiary without cause starting in november upon six months notice and at any time upon days notice for cause that remains uncured 
we paid million in and million in to maintain and modernize our information systems  including payments under our agreement with cgi group 
in  we expect to pay over million for the same purposes 
these cost estimates  as well as future cost estimates  may underestimate the costs necessary to maintain and modernize our information systems  and the fees we pay to cgi group may exceed the costs we would have incurred had we not outsourced certain functions to cgi group 
as a newly public company  we are subject to extensive financial and reporting requirements that apply to public companies 
our management information  internal control and financial reporting systems have required and may require further enhancements and development to satisfy the financial and other reporting requirements that we must comply with as a public company 
failure to protect our clients confidential information and privacy could result in the loss of customers  reduce our profitability and or subject us to fines and penalties 
a number of our businesses are subject to privacy regulations and to confidentiality obligations 
for example  the collection and use of patient data in our third party administration business is the subject of national and state legislation  including the health insurance portability and accountability act  or hipaa  and some of our activities are subject to the privacy regulations of the gramm leach bliley act 
we also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information that we obtain from our existing vendors and clients  generally in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information 
we are developing  implementing and maintaining a comprehensive written information security program with appropriate administrative  technical and physical safeguards to protect such confidential information 
if we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information  we could experience adverse consequences  including regulatory problems  loss of reputation and client litigation 
we may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred acquisition costs and value of business acquired  which would increase our expenses and reduce our profitability 
deferred acquisition costs  or dac  represent costs which vary with and are primarily related to the sale and issuance of our insurance policies and investment contracts that are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the related insurance policies 
these costs include commissions in excess of ultimate renewal commissions  direct mail and printing costs  sales material and some support costs  such as underwriting and policy and contract issuance expenses 
under gaap  dac is deferred and recognized over the expected life of the policy or contract in relation to either the premiums or gross profits from the underlying contracts 
in addition  when we acquire a block of insurance policies or investment contracts  we assign a portion of the purchase price to the right to receive future net cash flows from existing insurance and investment contracts and policies 
this intangible asset  called value of business acquired  or voba  represents the actuarially estimated present value of future cash flows from the acquired policies 
we amortize the value of this intangible asset in a manner similar to the amortization of dac 
our amortization of dac and voba generally depends upon anticipated profits from investments  surrender and other policy and contract charges and mortality and maintenance expense margins 
unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses  investment returns  mortality  morbidity or withdrawals or lapses may cause us to accelerate the amortization of dac or voba  or both  or to record a charge to increase benefit reserves 
we regularly review dac and voba to determine if they are recoverable from future income 
if we determine that these costs are not recoverable  they are charged to expenses in the financial period in which we make this determination 
for example  if we determine that we are unable to recover dac from profits over the life of a block of insurance policies  or if withdrawals or surrender charges which are fees charged to a policyholder when a life insurance policy is surrendered for its cash value prior to the end of the surrender charge period  which fee is intended to cover new policy acquisition costs and subsequent administrative expenses associated with early withdrawals do not fully offset the unamortized acquisition costs related to those policies  we have to recognize the additional dac amortization as a current period expense 
we also regularly review the recoverability of voba for impairment 
we may not find suitable acquisition candidates or new insurance ventures  and even if we do  we may not successfully integrate any acquired companies or successfully invest in new ventures  which may limit our potential for growth or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
while our primary focus is organic growth of our existing businesses by expanding our product and marketing capabilities  we evaluate opportunities to grow through strategic alliances and acquisitions of blocks of business and or companies that are compatible with our core businesses 
accordingly  we intend to evaluate from time to time possible acquisition transactions and the start up of complementary businesses  and at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions and new ventures 
while our business model is not dependent upon acquisitions or new insurance ventures  the time frame for achieving or further improving upon our desired market positions can be significantly shortened through opportune acquisitions or new insurance ventures 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition transactions or insurance ventures  that such transactions will be financed and completed on acceptable terms or that our future acquisitions or ventures will be successful 
the process of integrating any companies we do acquire or investing in new ventures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  implementation of an acquisition strategy may entail a number of risks  including among other things inaccurate assessment of liabilities  difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings  failure to achieve anticipated revenues  earnings or cash flow  and an increase in our indebtedness and limitations upon our ability to access additional capital when needed 
our failure to adequately address these acquisition risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the inability of kanawha to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts could harm our ability to meet our obligations and pay shareholder dividends 
see dividends of item of this report  incorporated herein by reference  for a discussion of the risk associated with the inability of kanawha to pay dividends to us 
we may face losses if morbidity rates or mortality rates differ significantly from our pricing expectations 
we set prices for our life insurance and long term care insurance based upon expected claims and payment patterns  using assumptions for morbidity rates and mortality rates of our policyholders and contractholders 
the long term profitability of these products depends upon how our actual experience compares with our pricing assumptions 
for example  if morbidity rates are higher  or mortality rates are lower  than our pricing assumptions  we could be required to make greater payments under long term care insurance policies than we had projected 
similarly  if mortality rates are higher than our pricing assumptions  we could be required to make greater payments under our life insurance policies with guaranteed minimum death benefits than we had projected 
our and our predecessor s experience with our paycheck protector disability income plan is one example of a product that failed to meet our and our predecessor s pricing assumptions with regard to morbidity or mortality rates in the past 
the paycheck protector disability income plan provides insured individuals with a percentage of their income in the event they become disabled 
the policies provide supplemental coverage in addition to all other disability benefits and coverages  and their terms are tailored for different occupations 
our and our predecessor s cumulative claims experience for this product has been higher than expected 
this is due primarily to higher than expected claims due to higher than expected morbidity and mortality rates in one large group of policies issued to employees of a single employer 
this group s experience has produced claims approximately higher than expected 
the risks of a deviation of the actual morbidity and mortality rates from the expected rates are particularly significant for our long term care insurance products 
long term care insurance policies provide for long duration coverage and  therefore  our actual claims experience will emerge over many years after pricing assumptions have been established 
moreover  as a relatively new product in the market  long term care insurance does not have the extensive claims experience history of life insurance  and as a result  our ability to forecast future claim rates for long term care insurance is more limited than for life insurance 
consistent with other carriers offering long term care insurance in the life and health insurance industry  our and our predecessor s claims in certain states have exceeded those anticipated when the long term care products were developed 
most significantly  our and our predecessor s cumulative claims experience for long term care products in the state of florida has been higher than expected 
our ability to retain existing long term care insurance policyholders may be adversely affected if we raise premiums on our in force long term care insurance products 
although the terms of many of our long term care insurance policies permit us to increase premiums during the premium paying period  any implementation of a premium increase could have an adverse effect on our ability to retain existing policyholders 
risks relating to our industry recently announced governmental investigations and litigation alleging the illegal use of bid rigging schemes and contingent commissions by insurance companies and brokers may adversely affect our industry and us by negatively impacting the level and volatility of stock prices of companies operating in the insurance industry  if we become the subject of investigations or related litigation of this type  or if industry regulation  practices and customs change in ways that are detrimental to the success of our business strategy 
within the last two years  the new york state attorney general and other state agencies have filed lawsuits accusing several large insurance brokers of fraudulent behavior  including alleged participation in bid rigging schemes and acceptance of improper payments from insurers in exchange for agreeing not to shop for competitive quotes for customers of the insurers 
the new york state attorney general s office and other state regulatory agencies have and are investigating a number of property and casualty and health and life insurers for alleged participation in these schemes  as well as arrangements whereby a particular insurer pays an insurance broker additional or contingent commissions for placing a particular volume of insurance or insurance which leads to a certain level of insurer profitability 
this lawsuit and these investigations have resulted in negative publicity and increased price volatility for securities of insurance companies 
in addition  the scope of industry participants subject to investigation and enforcement actions is expanding and likely will continue to expand 
while we have not been subpoenaed or named in a lawsuit  we cannot assure you that we will not become involved in an investigation or be named as a defendant in an enforcement action or lawsuit 
one possible result of these investigations and attendant lawsuits is that many insurance industry practices and customs may change  including  but not limited to  the manner in which insurance is marketed and distributed through independent brokers and agents 
our business strategy requires us to rely heavily on both independent brokers and agents and our internal sales force to market and distribute insurance products 
we cannot predict how industry regulation  customs and practices with respect to the use of brokers and agents may change 
such changes  however  could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy  which could materially affect our growth and profitability 
consolidation in the insurance and reinsurance industry could lead to lower margins for us and less demand for our products and services 
the insurance and reinsurance industry is undergoing a process of consolidation as industry participants seek to enhance their product and geographic reach  client base  operating efficiency and market share through merger and acquisition activities 
the larger entities resulting from these merger and acquisition activities may seek to use the benefits of consolidation to  among other things  implement price reductions for their products and services 
if competitive pressures compel us to reduce our prices  our operating margins will decrease 
as the insurance industry consolidates  competition for customers may become more intense and the importance of obtaining and properly servicing each customer will become greater 
we could incur greater expenses in connection with obtaining and retaining customers  which could reduce our operating margins and profitability 
our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by many factors beyond our control  including factors affecting the insurance and reinsurance industry as a whole and general economic  financial market and political conditions  all of which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the results of operations of companies in the insurance and reinsurance industry historically have been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
our profitability may be affected significantly by the following differences between actual and expected losses that we cannot reasonably anticipate using historical loss data and other identifiable factors at the time we price our products 
volatile and unpredictable developments  including man made  weather related and other natural catastrophes or terrorist attacks  or large court awards for particular damages resulting from claims against us 
changes in the level of reinsurance capacity 
for example  in the aftermath of the september   terrorist attacks  the reinsurance markets for many products have been restricted  and kanawha has experienced increased costs related to catastrophe reinsurance and some other annually renewable reinsurance 
changes in the amount of our loss reserves which are the liabilities we will establish to reflect the estimated cost of claims payments and related expenses that we will ultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance we write resulting from new types of claims and new or changing judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liabilities 
fluctuations in equity markets  interest rates  credit risk and foreign currency exposure  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested assets and may impact the ultimate payout of losses 
for example  the investment environment of the past several years adversely affected our predecessor s investment portfolio  which had significant credit losses in and and rates of return on its bond portfolio lower than its original expectations 
in addition  the demand for the types of insurance we offer can vary significantly  rising as the overall level of economic activity increases and falling as that activity decreases  which will cause our revenues to fluctuate 
these fluctuations in results of operations and revenues may cause the price of our common stock to decline and to be volatile 
our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected from time to time by general economic  financial market and political conditions 
these conditions include levels of employment 
as unemployment increases  employers have fewer employees requiring insurance 
levels of consumer lending 
as consumer lending decreases  individuals have less disposable cash and may choose not to purchase our insurance products  may terminate existing policies or permit them to lapse or may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased 
levels of inflation 
we are exposed to inflation risk because we invest substantial funds in nominal assets  which are not indexed to the level of inflation  but the underlying liabilities are indexed to the level of inflation 
life insurance policies with reserves of approximately million as of december  representing of our total reserves  have death benefits that are guaranteed to grow based on inflation linked indices 
in times of rapidly rising inflation  the growth in amount of credited death benefit on these liabilities increases relative to the investment income earned on the nominal assets  resulting in an adverse impact on earnings 
in addition  we are exposed to inflation risk with respect to some major medical insurance policies to the extent that medical costs increase with inflation at a greater pace than our ability to increase premiums 
inflation may also effect the adequacy of our reserves  making them inadequate and requiring us to increase our reserves 
insurance industry cycles 
the life and health industry is occasionally affected by moderate pricing cycles  and in these periods it may become difficult to underwrite policies at premium levels that are profitable 
movements of the financial markets 
unpredictable movements and volatility in the financial markets may diminish the value of  and returns on  our portfolio of investment assets 
fluctuations in interest rates  monetary policy  demographics  and legislative and competitive factors may also influence our performance 
during periods of economic downturn individuals and businesses may choose not to purchase our insurance products and other related products and services  may terminate existing policies or contracts or permit them to lapse or may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased  businesses may have fewer employees requiring insurance coverage due to rising unemployment levels  new disability insurance claims and claims on other specialized insurance products tend to rise  insureds tend to increase their utilization of health and dental benefits if they anticipate becoming unemployed or losing benefits 
the insurance and related businesses in which we operate may be subject to periodic negative publicity  which may negatively impact our financial condition and operating results 
due to the nature of the market for the insurance and related products and services we provide  we interact with and distribute our products and services ultimately to individual consumers 
there may be a perception that these purchasers are unsophisticated and need consumer protection 
accordingly  from time to time  consumer advocate groups or the media may focus attention on our products and services and subject our industry to negative publicity 
we may also be negatively impacted if another company in our industry engages in practices resulting in increased public attention to our businesses 
negative publicity may also result in increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation  which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by impeding our ability to market our products and services  requiring us to change our products or services or increasing the regulatory burdens under which we will operate 
catastrophe losses  including man made catastrophe losses  could cause unanticipated increases in claims frequency and severity  which could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes 
in the future  we may experience catastrophe losses that may materially reduce our profitability or have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
catastrophes can be caused by various natural events  including hurricanes  disease  earthquakes  fires and epidemics  or can be man made catastrophes  including terrorist attacks or accidents such as airplane crashes 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable  and catastrophe losses can vary widely 
it is possible that both the frequency and severity of man made catastrophes will increase and that we will not be able to implement exclusions from coverage in our policies or obtain reinsurance for losses from catastrophes 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
claims resulting from natural or man made catastrophes could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition 
our ability to write new business also could be affected 
increases in healthcare costs and the geographic concentration of our insureds and the effects of inflation could increase the severity of claims from catastrophes in the future 
our voluntary life and health insurance operations could be materially impacted by catastrophes such as terrorist attacks or by an epidemic that causes a widespread increase in mortality  morbidity or disability rates or that causes an increase in the need for medical care 
the mortality rate refers to the relationship of the frequency of deaths of individual members of a group to the entire group membership over a specified period of time 
the morbidity rate refers to the relationship of the incidence of disease or disability contracted by individual members of a group to the entire group membership over a specified period of time 
losses due to catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to manage these risks depends in part on our successful utilization of catastrophic life reinsurance to limit the size of life insurance losses from a single event or multiple events  and life and disability reinsurance to limit the size of life or disability insurance exposure on an individual insured life 
it also depends in part on state regulations that may prohibit us from excluding such risks or from withdrawing from or increasing premium rates in catastrophe prone areas 
catastrophe reinsurance may not be available at commercially acceptable rates in the future 
this means that the occurrence of a significant catastrophe could materially reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
reinsurance arrangements and any derivative instruments we use to hedge our business risks may not be available or adequate to protect us against our business risks  and we will be subject to the risk that the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements and derivative instruments may default on their obligations  all of which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for some risks underwritten by our various business segments 
market conditions beyond our control will determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection we purchase 
for example  after the terrorist assaults of september   reinsurance for man made catastrophes became generally unavailable due to capacity constraints and  to the limited extent available  much more expensive 
the high cost of reinsurance or lack of affordable coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to obtain sufficient reinsurance  it could adversely affect our ability to write future business 
as part of our business  we reinsure some life and health risks with reinsurers 
although these reinsurers are liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance the portion of an insurance policy liability that has been reinsured  we remain liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured 
as a result  ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims 
we are subject to credit risk with respect to our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers 
our reinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to us or they may not pay such recoverables on a timely basis 
a reinsurer s insolvency  underwriting results or investment returns may affect its ability to fulfill reinsurance obligations 
our reinsurance facilities generally are subject to annual renewal with respect to new insurance policies written 
reinsurance for policies previously reinsured generally remains in effect even if the reinsurance carrier elects not to reinsure new insurance policies 
we may not be able to maintain our current reinsurance facilities and  even where highly desirable or necessary  we may not be able to obtain other reinsurance facilities in adequate amounts or at favorable rates 
if we are unable to renew our expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities  either our net exposures would increase or  if we are unwilling to bear an increase in net exposures  we may have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments 
either of these potential developments could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  kanawha has sold businesses through reinsurance ceded to third parties 
for example  in december  kanawha ceded all of its in force deferred annuity products through coinsurance contracts  which are arrangements in which the coverage ceded to the reinsurer on an individual policy is in the same form as that of the direct policy issued to the policyholder  to madison national life insurance company 
however  we would be responsible for administering this business in the event of a default by the reinsurer 
we may not have the administrative systems and capabilities to process this business 
accordingly  we may need to obtain those capabilities in the event of an insolvency of one or more of the reinsurers of these businesses 
we might be forced to obtain such capabilities on unfavorable terms  with a resulting material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
while we do not currently use derivative instruments to hedge business risks  we may use derivative instruments in the future to hedge various business risks 
we may enter into a variety of derivative instruments  including options  forwards  interest rate and currency swaps and options to enter into interest rate and currency swaps with a number of counterparties 
if our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under the derivative instruments  our hedges of the related risk will be ineffective 
that failure could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face significant competitive pressures in our businesses  which may reduce premium rates and prevent us from pricing our products at rates that enable us to earn a profit 
in each of our lines of business  we compete with other insurance companies or service providers  depending on the line and product 
competitors include insurance companies and financial institutions 
our main competitors include life and health insurance companies and the blue cross blue shield affiliates in the states in which we write business 
commercial competitors include benefits and life insurance companies as well as not for profit dental plans 
we are among the smallest competitors in terms of national market share in our business lines and in some cases there are one or more major market players in a particular line of business 
competition in the businesses we pursue is based on many factors  including quality of service  product features  price  scope of distribution  scale  financial strength ratings and name recognition 
we compete for customers and distributors with many insurance companies and other financial services companies 
we compete not only for business and individual customers  employer and other group customers  but also for agents and distribution relationships 
some of our competitors may offer a broader array of products than we do  may have a greater diversity of distribution resources  may have better brand recognition  may from time to time have more competitive pricing  may have lower cost structures or  with respect to insurers  may have higher financial strength or claims paying ratings 
some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete 
also  as a result of the gramm leach bliley act  which was enacted in november  financial institutions are now able to affiliate with other insurance companies to offer services similar to our own 
this has resulted in new competitors with significant financial resources entering some of our target markets 
moreover  some of our competitors may have a lower target for returns on capital allocated to their business than we do  which may lead them to price their products and services lower than we do 
in addition  from time to time  companies enter and exit the markets in which we operate  which increases competition at times when there are new entrants 
for example  several large insurance companies have recently entered the market for individual health insurance products 
we may lose business to competitors offering competitive products at lower prices or for other reasons  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in some markets  we compete with organizations that have substantial market share 
in addition  organizations with sizable market share or provider owned plans may be able to obtain favorable financial arrangements from health care providers that are not available to us 
without our own similar arrangements  we may not be able to compete effectively in such markets 
new competition could also cause the supply of insurance to change  which could affect our ability to price our products at attractive rates and adversely affect our underwriting results 
although there are some impediments facing potential competitors who wish to enter the markets we serve  new competitors may still enter our target markets  affording our customers significant flexibility in moving to other insurance providers 
our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition to the occasional employment related litigation to which all businesses are subject  we are a defendant in actions arising out of insurance and other related business operations 
in addition  we are  involved in various regulatory investigations and examinations relating to our operations 
we may from time to time be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to current and past business operations  including  but not limited to disputes over coverage or claims adjudication  disputes regarding sales practices  disclosures  premium refunds  licensing  regulatory compliance and compensation arrangements  disputes with our agents  producers or network providers over compensation and termination of contracts and related claims  disputes relating to premiums charged or changes to premiums charged  disputes concerning past premiums charged by companies acquired by us for coverage that may have been based on factors such as race  disputes with customers regarding the ratio of premiums to benefits in our various business segments  disputes alleging illegal packaging of credit insurance products with other products provided by financial institutions  disputes with taxing authorities regarding our tax liabilities  and disputes relating to some businesses acquired or disposed of by us 
in addition  plaintiffs continue to bring new types of legal claims against insurance and related companies 
current and future court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure to these types of claims 
multiparty or class action claims may present additional exposure to substantial economic  non economic or punitive damage awards 
the loss of even one of these claims  if it resulted in a significant damage award or a judicial ruling that was otherwise detrimental  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
this risk of potential liability may make reasonable settlements of claims more difficult to obtain 
we cannot determine with any certainty what new theories of recovery may evolve or what their impact may be on our businesses 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  which increases our costs and could restrict how we conduct our business 
our operating subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business 
this regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders  as opposed to shareholders and other investors 
to that end  the laws of the various states establish insurance departments with broad powers with respect to such matters as licensing companies to transact business  authorizing lines of business  mandating capital and surplus requirements  regulating underwriting limitations  imposing dividend limitations  regulating changes in control  licensing agents and distributors of insurance products  placing limitations on the minimum and maximum size of life insurance contracts  restricting companies ability to enter and exit markets  admitting statutory assets which are assets determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles  mandating some insurance benefits  restricting companies ability to terminate or cancel coverage  requiring companies to provide various types of coverage  regulating premium rates  including the ability to increase premium rates  approving policy forms  regulating trade and claims practices  imposing privacy requirements  establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards  restricting certain transactions between affiliates  regulating the content of disclosures to debtors in the credit insurance area  regulating the type  amounts and valuation of investments  mandating assessments or other surcharges for guaranty funds which are state mandated funds funded by contributions from insurance companies operating in a particular state and maintained to cover the obligations to policyholders of insolvent insurance companies  regulating market conduct and sales practices of insurers and agents  and restricting contact with consumers  such as the recently created national do not call list  and imposing consumer protection measures 
some jurisdictions require us to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible by insurers 
each of these jurisdictions dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks 
our share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of our respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction 
we are exposed to risk of losses in connection with mandated participation in such schemes in those jurisdictions in which they are effective 
in addition  hipaa requires us to comply with insurance reform provisions as well as requirements relating to the privacy of individuals 
hipaa guarantees the issuance and renewability of certain health insurance coverage for individuals and small groups generally or fewer employees and limits exclusions based on pre existing conditions 
most of the insurance reform provisions of hipaa became effective for plan years beginning july  if regulatory requirements impede our ability to raise premium rates  utilize new policy forms or terminate  deny or cancel coverage in any of our businesses  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the capacity for an insurance company s growth in premiums is in part a function of its statutory surplus 
maintaining appropriate levels of statutory surplus  as measured by statutory accounting principles  is considered important by insurance regulatory authorities and the private agencies that rate insurers claims paying abilities and financial strength 
failure to maintain specified levels of statutory surplus could result in increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement  action by regulatory authorities or a downgrade by rating agencies 
we may be unable to obtain or maintain all required licenses and approvals  and our business may not fully comply with the wide variety of applicable laws and regulations or the relevant authority s interpretation of the laws and regulations 
some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals 
if we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities could prohibit or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or impose a monetary penalty on us 
that type of action could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
changes in regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth 
legislation or other regulatory reforms that increase the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that change the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business  results of operations or financial condition 
for example  some states  including the states in which we currently do most of our business and most of the states in which we intend to do business in the future  have imposed new time limits for the payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period 
some of these states have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices 
if we were unable for any reason to comply with these requirements  it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
legislative or regulatory changes that could significantly harm us and our subsidiaries include  but are not limited to legislation that holds insurance companies or managed care companies liable for adverse consequences of medical or dental decisions  limitations on premium levels or the ability to raise premiums on existing policies  increases in minimum capital  reserves and other financial viability requirements  imposition of fines  taxes or other penalties for improper licensing  the failure to promptly pay claims  however defined  or other regulatory violations  increased licensing requirements  prohibitions or limitations on provider financial incentives and provider risk sharing arrangements  imposition of more stringent standards of review of our coverage determinations  new benefit mandates  increased regulation relating to the use of associations and trusts in the sale of individual health insurance  limitations on our ability to build appropriate provider networks and  as a result  manage health care and utilization due to any willing provider legislation  which requires us to take any provider willing to accept our reimbursement  limitations on the ability to manage health care and utilization due to direct access laws that allow insureds to seek services directly from specialty medical providers without referral by a primary care provider  and restriction on solicitation of pre funded funeral insurance consumers by funeral board laws 
potential changes in state regulations state legislatures regularly enact laws that alter and  in many cases  increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies 
further  state insurance regulators regularly reinterpret existing laws and regulations  and the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  regularly undertakes regulatory projects  all of which can affect our operations 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies 
further  the naic and state insurance regulators are re examining existing laws and regulations  specifically focusing on modifications to holding company regulations  interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws 
potential changes in federal regulations although the united states federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business  changes in federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas  including changes in the gramm leach bliley act  financial services regulation and federal taxation  could significantly harm the insurance industry and us 
federal legislation and administrative policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation  financial services regulation and federal taxation can reduce our profitability 
in addition  state legislatures and the united states congress continue to focus on health care issues 
there are many aspects of employee benefits plans that state laws may not regulate because the federal employee retirement income security act  or erisa  and the rules and regulations thereunder  in many instances prohibit or preempt any state laws governing employee benefit plans that would conflict with the provisions of erisa 
there have been recent legislative attempts to limit erisa s preemptive effect on state laws and  in addition  courts have read the rules promulgated under erisa to preempt state laws less broadly in recent years than they did in the past 
for example  the united states congress has  from time to time  considered legislation relating to changes in erisa to permit application of state law remedies  such as consequential and punitive damages  in lawsuits for wrongful denial of benefits  which  if adopted  could increase our liability for damages in future litigation 
additionally  new interpretations of existing laws and the passage of new legislation may harm our ability to sell new policies and increase our claims exposure on policies we issued previously 
a number of legislative proposals have been made at the federal level over the past several years that could impose added burdens on us 
these proposals would  among other things  mandate benefits with respect to certain diseases or medical procedures  require plans to offer an independent external review of certain coverage decisions and establish a national health insurance program 
any of these proposals  if implemented  could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
federal changes in medicare and medicaid that reduce provider reimbursements could have negative implications for the private sector due to cost shifting 
when the government reduces reimbursement rates for medicare and medicaid  providers often try to recover shortfalls by raising the prices charged to privately insured customers 
state small employer group and individual health insurance market reforms to increase access and affordability for consumers could also reduce our profitability by precluding us from appropriately pricing for risk in our individual and small employer group health insurance policies 
in addition  the united states congress and some federal agencies from time to time investigate the current condition of insurance regulation in the united states to determine whether to impose federal regulation or to allow an optional federal incorporation  similar to banks 
bills have been introduced in the united states congress from time to time that would provide for a federal scheme of chartering insurance companies or an optional federal charter for insurance companies 
meanwhile  the federal government has granted charters in years past to insurance like organizations that are not subject to state insurance regulations  such as risk retention groups 
it is difficult to predict the likelihood of a federal chartering scheme and its impact on the industry or on us 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect any proposed or future legislation  regulations or naic initiatives may have on how we will conduct our business 
in addition  the insurance laws or regulations adopted or amended from time to time may be more restrictive or may result in materially higher costs than current requirements 
the continued threat of terrorism  the occurrence of terrorist acts and ongoing military actions could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions  as well as heightened security measures in response to these threats and actions  may cause significant volatility in global financial markets  disruptions to commerce and reduced economic activity 
these consequences could have an adverse effect on the value of the assets in our investment portfolio 
we cannot predict whether  or the extent to which  companies in which we invest may suffer losses as a result of financial  commercial or economic disruptions  or how any such disruptions might affect the ability of those companies to pay interest or principal on their securities 
the continued threat of terrorism also could result in increased reinsurance prices and potentially cause us to retain more risk than we otherwise would retain if we were able to obtain reinsurance at lower prices 
in addition  the occurrence of terrorist actions could result in higher claims under our insurance policies than we anticipate 
genetic mapping research and other medical advances could adversely affect the financial performance of our life insurance and long term care insurance businesses 
genetic mapping research includes procedures focused on identifying key genes that render an individual predisposed to specific diseases  such as cancer or alzheimer s disease 
other medical advances  such as diagnostic imaging technologies  also may be used to detect the early onset of diseases such as cancer and heart disease 
we believe that if individuals learn through genetic testing or other medical advances that they are predisposed to particular conditions that may reduce life longevity or require long term care  they will be more likely to purchase our life insurance policies or not permit existing life and long term care polices to lapse 
in contrast  if individuals learn that they are genetically unlikely to develop the conditions that reduce longevity or require long term care  they will be less likely to purchase our life insurance products 
in addition  such individuals that are existing policyholders will be more likely to permit their life and long term care policies to lapse 
if we had access to the same genetic or other medical information as our prospective policyholders and contractholders  then we would be able to take this information into account in pricing our life and long term care insurance policies 
however  there are a number of regulatory proposals that would make genetic and other medical information confidential and unavailable to insurance companies 
legislators in some states have recently introduced similar legislation 
if these regulatory proposals were enacted  prospective policyholders and contractholders would only disclose this information if they chose to do so voluntarily 
these factors could lead us to reduce sales of products affected by these regulatory proposals and could result in a deterioration of the risk profile of our portfolio  which could lead to payments to our policyholders and contractholders that are higher than we anticipated 
risks relating to our common stock future offerings of debt securities  which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation  and future offerings of equity securities  which would dilute our existing shareholders and may be senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividend distributions  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources by offering debt securities or offering additional equity securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  senior or subordinated notes and series of preferred stock or common stock 
upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to our other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock 
additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock  or both 
our preferred stock  if issued  could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common stock 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their stock holdings in us 
we do not currently intend to pay dividends and any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors 
consequently  it is uncertain when  if ever  we will declare dividends to our shareholders 
we currently intend to retain any profits to provide capacity to write insurance and reinsurance and to accumulate reserves and surplus for the payment of claims 
as a result  our board of directors currently does not intend to declare dividends or make any other distributions 
our board of directors plans to periodically reevaluate our dividend policy 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
consequently  it is uncertain when  if ever  we will declare dividends to our shareholders 
applicable insurance laws and anti takeover provisions under virginia state law and in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our bylaws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of us or change our board of directors and officers  which may negatively affect the price per share of our common stock 
the virginia stock corporation act  our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain various provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage acquisition bids for  our company 
these provisions include provisions that  among other things divide our board of directors into three classes of directors serving staggered three year terms  permit our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock  limit the ability of shareholders to remove directors  limit the ability of shareholders to fill vacancies on our board of directors  impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at shareholder meetings  require the affirmative vote of holders of more than two thirds of our outstanding shares of common stock to amend the provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation  require the affirmative vote of holders of more than two thirds of our outstanding shares of common stock to approve mergers and consolidations or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets  and require approval of material acquisition transactions such as mergers  share exchanges  and material dispositions of corporate assets not in the ordinary course of business between our company and any holder of more than percent of any class of our outstanding voting shares by the holders of at least two thirds of the remaining voting shares of our company 
these provisions could have the effect of discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company and could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
before a person can acquire control of a united states insurance company  prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled 
state statutes in south carolina  where kanawha  our insurance subsidiary  is domiciled  provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer  a state insurance commissioner will typically consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant  the integrity of the applicant s board of directors and executive officers  the applicant s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control 
these state laws could have the effect of discouraging a potential acquiror from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company and could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in addition  the applicable insurance laws and anti takeover provisions of virginia law  our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for our shareholders to change our directors or officers or the strategies and policies implemented by our directors and officers 
our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry are subject to stock price and trading volume volatility  and you may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
from time to time  the stock price and the number of shares traded of companies in the insurance industry experience periods of significant volatility 
company specific matters  such as fluctuations in our operating performance as well as developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may cause this volatility 
accordingly  broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance  and you may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
recently  stock prices of companies in the insurance industry have experienced substantial volatility as a result of civil complaints filed in the last twelve months by the attorney general of the state of new york and investigations initiated by several other state agencies against several large insurance brokers 
also contributing to this volatility have been subsequent press reports indicating that these ongoing investigations of the insurance industry are expanding to include additional companies and practices 
the recent volatility in insurance industry stocks may continue for the foreseeable future and may affect the price of our stock

dividends as a holding company whose principal asset is the capital stock of kanawha and our indirect subsidiaries  we rely primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding debt obligations  dividends to shareholders including any dividends on our common stock and corporate expenses 
the ability of kanawha and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and to make such other payments in the future will depend on their statutory surplus which is the excess of assets over liabilities as determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles set by state insurance regulatory authorities  future statutory earnings which are earnings as determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles and regulatory restrictions 
kanawha is subject to state insurance laws and regulations and extensive regulatory oversight  including regulations that limit the amount of dividends and other distributions it can pay to kmg america  and consequently  that kmg america can pay to its shareholders 
the payment of dividends to kmg america by kanawha in excess of a certain amount ie  extraordinary dividends must be approved by the state of south carolina department of insurance 
extraordinary dividends  for which regulatory approval is required  include dividends whose fair market value together with that of other dividends made within the preceding twelve months when paid from other than earned surplus  exceed the lesser of a ten percent of the insurer s surplus as regards policyholders or b the net gain from operations  not including net realized capital gains or losses  or when paid from earned surplus  exceed the greater of a ten percent of the insurer s surplus as regards policyholders or b the net gain from operations  not including net realized capital gains or losses 
if insurance regulators determine that payment of an ordinary dividend or any other payments by our insurance subsidiary to us such as payments under a tax sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services would be adverse to policyholders or creditors  the regulators may block such payments that would otherwise be permitted without prior approval 
we cannot assure you that there will not be further regulatory actions restricting the ability of our insurance subsidiary to pay dividends 
if the ability of our insurance subsidiary to pay dividends or make other payments to us is materially restricted by regulatory requirements  it could adversely affect our ability to pay any dividends on our common stock and or service our debt and pay our other corporate expenses 
our non insurance subsidiaries generally are not subject to state insurance laws  regulations and oversight 
however  because our non insurance subsidiaries are owned  directly or indirectly  by kanawha  any dividends or distributions that kanawha receives from them are subject to state insurance regulations that limit dividends and distributions that kanawha can make to kmg america  and consequently  that kmg america can pay to its shareholders 
we currently intend to retain any profits to provide capacity to write insurance and reinsurance and to accumulate reserves and surplus for the payment of claims 
as a result  our board of directors currently does not intend to declare dividends or make any other distributions 
our board of directors plans to periodically reevaluate our dividend policy 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
consequently  it is uncertain when  if ever  we will declare dividends to our shareholders

this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in items and a of this report 
overview kmg america is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of virginia on january  we commenced our operations shortly before we completed our initial public offering of common stock on december   and our shares trade on the new york stock exchange under the symbol kma 
concurrently with the completion of our initial public offering  we completed our acquisition of kanawha and its subsidiaries  which are our primary operating subsidiaries and which underwrite and sell life and health insurance products which have been historically marketed primarily in the southeastern united states  but are now actively marketed nationwide 
for gaap accounting purposes  kanawha is treated as kmg america s predecessor entity and is referred to herein as our predecessor 
for financial reporting purposes  we have treated the acquisition as if it closed on december   rather than the actual closing date of december   as the effects of the acquisition for the period from december   through december   were not material 
accordingly  in the following discussion any financial information as of any date prior to  or for any period ending on or prior to  december   is reported on a historical basis without gaap purchase accounting adjustments reflecting the acquisition  and any financial information as of any date on or after  or for any period ending after  december   reflects gaap purchase accounting adjustments made as of december   reflecting the acquisition 
worksite insurance business 
our worksite insurance business is a provider of voluntary life and health insurance products to employers and their employees which have been historically marketed primarily in the southeastern united states but are now being marketed nationwide 
the primary insurance products that we underwrite include life insurance  short term disability insurance  dental insurance  indemnity health insurance  critical illness insurance  and employer excess risk insurance 
for the year ended december   our worksite insurance business produced premiums  commissions and fees  excluding intercompany payments  of million  which accounted for of our premiums  commissions and fees  excluding intercompany payments in that period 
our business strategy is to operate our existing worksite insurance business efficiently while developing a new worksite marketing and distribution organization that targets larger employer groups nationwide with an expanded variety of life and health insurance products which will add a new set of employer paid life insurance  disability and health products to our existing voluntary products 
in december  we opened sales offices hosting regional sales managers in boston  massachusetts and irvine  california  a los angeles suburb 
during  we opened regional sales offices in tampa  florida  chicago  illinois  new york  new york  atlanta  georgia  dallas  texas  kansas city  missouri  cleveland  ohio  philadelphia  pennsylvania  new orleans  louisiana  san diego and san francisco  california  and minneapolis  minnesota 
we expect to continue to add and train additional sales and sales support staff and marketing personnel at these facilities and at offices we open in other markets throughout the united states  and will recognize the costs associated with the these additions before we recognize revenues resulting from new sales activity 
consequently  we expect negative cash flow and operating losses in the short term 
senior market insurance business 
our senior market insurance business has been a provider in the southeastern united states of individual insurance products tailored to the needs of older individuals 
the primary insurance products that this business offered include long term care insurance that we underwrote and medicare supplement insurance underwritten by another carrier 
for the year ended december   our senior market insurance business produced premiums  commissions and fees  excluding intercompany payments  of million  which accounted for of our premiums  commissions and fees  excluding intercompany payments  in that period 
on october   we sold our agency office in ft 
myers  florida that was primarily responsible for distributing our senior market insurance products 
in conjunction with the sale of the ft 
myers agency office  we decided not to continue actively underwriting long term care insurance policies after december  we intend to retain and actively manage the existing block of in force long term care insurance policies including the right to receive future premiums and the liability for future claims 
we also intend to continue offering through our worksite distribution channel medicare supplement insurance written by another carrier  which generates commission income for us 
third party administration business 
our third party administration business provides a wide range of insurance product administration  claims handling  eligibility administration  call center and support services 
this business primarily administers the insurance plans offered by our worksite insurance business and senior market insurance business 
our third party administration business also provides administrative and managed care services to third parties  such as employers with self funded health care plans  other insurance carriers  reinsurers and managed care plans 
for the year ended december   our third party administration business produced commissions and fees  excluding intercompany payments  of million  which accounted for of our premiums  commissions and fees  excluding intercompany payments  in that period 
our primary business strategy for this business is to grow this business as it administers the increasing volume of policies and products that we anticipate will be sold by the worksite insurance business as we attempt to grow that business 
in addition  as our national worksite marketing business develops  we intend to opportunistically market our third party administration services to self insured plans  stop loss insurers  pharmacy benefit organizations  managed care service providers  other insurance carriers and reinsurers nationwide 
it is expected that any incremental costs associated with this expanded marketing will be modest and will be funded out of the operations of our third party administration business 
in addition  we have retained our predecessor s closed block of life and health business reported in the acquired business segment and the investment and marketing activities reported in the corporate and other segment 
while acquisitions of books of business from other insurance carriers is not one of our principal growth strategies  we will consider making acquisitions on an opportunistic basis if we can complete the acquisitions on favorable financial terms that we expect to be generally accretive to earnings per share and return on equity while maintaining our financial strength ratings 
we expect to realize earnings from our investment portfolio 
insurance companies in both the life and health and property and casualty insurance industries earn profits on the investment float  which reflects the investment income earned on the premiums paid to the insurer between the time of receipt and the time benefits are paid out under the policy 
volatility in the capital markets  changes in interest rates and changes in economic conditions can all impact the amount of earnings that we will realize from our investment portfolio 
marketplace conditions and trends described below are some of the significant recent events and trends affecting the life and health insurance industry and the possible effects they may have on our operations in the future 
the trend to shift health care costs to employees and rising healthcare costs in general are causing individuals to purchase a wider array of life and health insurance products 
we believe these trends will result in greater demand for our voluntary worksite insurance products 
the volatility in the equity markets over the past few years has posed a number of problems for some participants in the life and health insurance industry 
even though the capital markets have recovered  not all companies have participated evenly in the recovery 
we and our predecessor have historically had minimal equity exposure less than of total invested assets as of december  and we plan to continue to manage equity asset allocations conservatively in the future 
corporate bond defaults and credit downgrades  which have resulted in other than temporary impairment in the value of many securities  have had a material impact on life and health insurers in the past few years 
while our debt investments have not been immune to corporate credit problems  losses from defaults have historically not been material to our predecessor s financial condition 
we intend to manage our investment portfolio conservatively in the future to attempt to mitigate the risk of losses from defaults 
some life and health insurance companies have recently suffered significant reductions in capital and will have to improve their capital adequacy ratios to support their business or divest a portion of their business 
we expect these trends to have a positive impact on our competitive position in the industry as carriers become more disciplined with product pricing and or exit markets or product lines in which we will compete 
many of the events and trends affecting the life and health insurance industry have had an equal or greater impact on the life and health reinsurance industry 
these events led to a decline in the availability of reinsurance 
while we currently cede a limited amount of our primary insurance business to reinsurers  and we plan to continue this practice  diminishing reinsurance capacity has negatively impacted our predecessor in the past and may further negatively impact our operations in the future 
if we cannot obtain affordable reinsurance coverage  either our net exposures will increase or we will have to reduce our underwriting commitments 
recently announced governmental investigations and litigation alleging the illegal use of bid rigging schemes and contingent commissions by insurance companies and brokers may adversely affect our industry and us by negatively impacting the level and volatility of stock prices of companies operating in the insurance industry  if we become the subject of investigations or related litigation of this type  or if industry regulation  practices and customs change in ways that are detrimental to the success of our business strategy 
critical factors affecting results our profitability depends on the adequacy of our product pricing and underwriting  the accuracy of assumptions about future experience used in establishing reserves for future policyholder benefits and claims  returns on invested assets and our ability to manage our costs and expenses 
factors affecting these items may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  our profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting benefits  claims and other costs  including medical and dental costs 
it also depends on our ability to manage future benefit and other costs through product design  underwriting criteria  utilization review or claims management and  in health and dental insurance  negotiation of favorable provider contracts 
changes in market conditions and numerous other factors may also materially adversely affect our ability to manage claim costs 
as a result of one or more of these factors or other factors  claims could substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of our insurance policies and  to a lesser extent  fee income from administrative services and commissions on the placement of third party insurance products 
sales of insurance policies are recognized in revenue when earned as insurance premiums  while sales of administrative services and commission income are recognized as fee income on our consolidated statements of operations when earned 
our premium  fee and commission income is supplemented by income earned from our investment portfolio 
we recognize revenue from interest payments  dividends and sales of investments when earned 
our investment portfolio is currently primarily invested in fixed maturity securities 
both investment income and realized capital gains on these investments can be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates 
interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
fluctuations in interest rates affect our returns on  and the market value of  fixed maturity and short term investments 
the fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
the fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
in addition  actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk  such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities  may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
in periods of declining interest rates  mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage backed securities  mortgage loan obligations and bonds in our investment portfolio are more likely to be prepaid or redeemed as borrowers seek to borrow at lower interest rates  and we may be required to reinvest funds in lower interest bearing investments 
expenses our expenses primarily consist of policyholder benefits  insurance commissions  premium taxes  licenses  fees  amortization of deferred acquisition costs  or dac  and value of business acquired  or voba  interest on the million promissory note issued in connection with the kanawha acquisition  and general insurance operating expenses 
disposition of businesses in december  our predecessor transferred its fixed deferred annuity block of insurance for contracts still in the accumulation phase to madison national life insurance company madison national 
the business was transferred pursuant to a coinsurance agreement under which our predecessor ceded to madison national substantially all assets and liabilities related to its fixed annuity business 
the transaction resulted in a transfer of million of reserves and million of related assets 
the ceding commission of million combined with the write off of the remaining dac asset of million resulted in no gain or loss being reflected on our predecessor s gaap financial statements as a result of the transaction 
total premium considerations of  and million generated by our predecessor s fixed deferred annuity business were recognized in the years ended december   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies we consider the following accounting policies to be critical due to the amount of judgment and uncertainty inherent in the application of these policies 
in calculating financial statement estimates  the use of different assumptions could produce materially different estimates 
in addition  if factors such as those described in item a of this report cause actual events to differ from the assumptions used in applying the accounting policies and calculating financial estimates  our business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
reserves policy benefit reserves and other claim reserves are established according to generally accepted actuarial principles and are based on a number of factors 
these factors include historical claim payments experience and actuarial assumptions used to estimate expected future claims experience 
these assumptions and other factors include trends in claims severity  frequency and other factors discussed below  the incidence of incurred claims  the extent to which all claims have been reported and internal claims processing changes 
the methods of making these estimates and establishing the related reserves are periodically reviewed and updated 
policy benefit and claim reserves do not represent an exact calculation of our ultimate liability  but instead represent our probability based estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of a claim or group of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known 
policy benefit reserves represent reserves established for claims not yet incurred 
claim reserves represent liabilities established for claims that have been incurred and have future benefits to be paid as of the balance sheet date 
the adequacy of reserves will be impacted by future trends in claims severity  frequency and other factors including changes in the economic cycle  the level of market interest rates and inflation  emerging medical perceptions regarding physiological or psychological causes of disability  emerging health issues and new methods of treatment or accommodation  legislative changes and changes in taxation  and claims handling procedures 
many of these items are not directly quantifiable  particularly on a prospective basis 
reserve estimates are refined as experience develops 
adjustments to reserves  both positive and negative  are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations of the period in which such estimates are updated 
because establishment of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates of future losses  there can be no certainty that ultimate losses will not exceed existing reserves 
future loss development could require reserves to be increased  which could have a material adverse effect on earnings in the periods in which such increases are made 
reserving methodology policy benefit reserves for life insurance  long term care insurance  individual and group accident and health insurance  disability insurance and group life and health insurance are recorded at the present value of future benefits to be paid to policyholders less the present value of the future net premiums this method is called the net level premium method 
these amounts are estimated and include assumptions made when the policy is issued as to the expected investment yield  inflation  mortality  morbidity  claim termination rates  awards for social security and withdrawal rates  as well as other assumptions that are based on our experience 
these assumptions reflect anticipated trends and include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations 
throughout the life of the policy  reserves are based on these original assumptions and cannot be modified pursuant to gaap unless policy reserves prove inadequate 
we also record an unearned premium reserve which represents the portion of premiums collected or due and unpaid which is intended to pay for insurance coverage in a period after the current accounting period 
loss recognition testing of our policy benefit reserves is performed annually 
this testing involves a comparison of our actual net liability position all liabilities less dac and voba to the present value of future net cash flows calculated using then current assumptions 
these assumptions are based on our best estimate of future experience 
to the extent a premium deficiency exists  it would be recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations and a corresponding reduction in dac or voba 
any additional deficiency would be recognized as a premium deficiency reserve 
historically  loss recognition testing has not resulted in an adjustment to dac or reserves 
these adjustments would occur only if economic  mortality and or morbidity conditions significantly deviated from the underlying assumptions 
in accordance with gaap purchase accounting requirements  our predecessor s policy and contract reserves were recorded at fair value upon the closing of the kanawha acquisition 
the policy and contract reserves were calculated as the present value of future benefits and expenses less the present value of future net premiums 
these values were actuarially determined and were based upon assumed future interest rates  administrative expenses  mortality  morbidity and policy lapse rates as appropriate for the particular benefit on the purchase date 
for long term care insurance  assumptions for the present value of net premiums in the fair value calculation are consistent with current and anticipated premium increases  including those approved in the last twelve to eighteen months in certain jurisdictions for policies currently in force 
these assumptions now serve as the original assumptions described in the first paragraph above 
reserve interest assumptions ie  discount rates used by us in establishing our current policy benefit reserves were modified on the purchase date 
the valuation interest rate is determined by taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio 
benefit reserves for limited payment policies take into account  where necessary  any deferred profits to be recognized in income over the policy term 
policy benefit claims are charged to expense in the period that the claims are incurred 
the discount rate is the interest rate at which future net cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of such cash flows 
if the discount rate chosen is higher than actual future investment returns  our investment returns will be insufficient to support the interest rate assumed when reserves were established 
in this case  the reserves may eventually be insufficient to support future benefit payments 
alternatively  if a discount rate is chosen that is lower than actual future investment results  the reserves  and  for products such as long term care insurance  the claims incurred in the current period will be overstated and profits will be accumulated in the reserves rather than reported as current earnings 
we set our discount rate assumptions in conjunction with the current and expected future investment income rate of the assets supporting the reserves 
if the investment yield at which new investments are purchased is below or above the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio  it is likely that the discount rate chosen at future financial reporting dates will vary accordingly 
deferred acquisition costs the costs of acquiring new business that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new business have been deferred to the extent that these costs are deemed recoverable from future premiums or gross profits and are amortized into income as discussed below 
acquisition costs primarily consist of commissions  policy issuance expenses and some direct marketing expenses 
for most insurance products  amortization of dac and voba is recognized in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenue to the total anticipated premium revenue  which gives effect to expected terminations 
dac is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies 
anticipated premium revenue is determined using assumptions consistent with those utilized in the determination of liabilities for insurance reserves 
for fixed and variable annuities  interest sensitive life insurance and fixed and variable universal life insurance policies none of which we currently offer  dac and voba is amortized in proportion to the present value of estimated gross margins or profits from investment  mortality  expense margins and surrender charges over the estimated life of the policy or contract 
the assumptions used for the estimates are consistent with those used in computing the policy or contract liabilities 
a premium deficiency is recognized immediately by a charge to the statement of operations as a reduction of dac to the extent that future policy premiums  including anticipated interest income  are not adequate to recover all dac and related claims  benefits and expenses 
if the premium deficiency is greater than unamortized dac  a liability will be accrued for the excess deficiency 
the interest rate our predecessor used to amortize deferred acquisition costs in and was 
we eliminated all of our predecessor s dac upon the closing of the kanawha acquisition as part of the application of gaap purchase accounting requirements 
we began recording dac prospectively on january  value of business acquired voba is the value assigned to the insurance in force of acquired insurance companies or blocks of business at the date of acquisition 
the amortization of voba is recognized using amortization schedules established at the time of the acquisitions based upon expected patterns of premiums  mortality  policy lapses  and morbidity as adjusted to take into account variances between expected and actual costs 
voba is amortized over the expected life of the underlying business reinsured or acquired 
our predecessor has historically accounted for voba in a manner similar to dac 
the interest rate used to amortize voba in and was approximately 
periodically  our predecessor performed tests to determine if voba remained recoverable from future premiums on the acquired business 
our predecessor did not incur any write offs in or from impairments as a result of these recoverability tests 
we eliminated all of our predecessor s historical voba upon the closing of the kanawha acquisition as part of our application of gaap purchase accounting requirements 
we simultaneously re established voba for the value of our predecessor s in force business 
voba interest rate assumptions to amortize the voba were also reset upon the closing of the kanawha acquisition and the rate was approximately at december  under our assumptions as of december   we estimate that the amortization of voba  for the next five years will be as follows year ended december amortization if actual lapse and mortality experience is higher or lower than assumed for the table above  then actual amortization will be faster or slower than indicated in the table 
investments we regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued and that any impairment is charged against earnings in the proper period 
our investment portfolio is managed by an external asset management firm  with the exception of certain invested assets that are managed internally 
our methodology used to identify potential impairments requires judgment by us in conjunction with our investment managers 
changes in individual security values are monitored on a monthly basis in order to identify potential problem credits 
in addition  pursuant to our impairment testing process  each month the portfolio holdings are reviewed with additional screening for securities whose market price is equal to or less of their original purchase price 
management then makes an assessment as to which of these securities are other than temporarily impaired 
assessment factors include  but are not limited to  the financial condition and rating of the issuer  any collateral held and the length of time the market value of the security has been below cost 
each month the watch list is distributed to our investment committee and the outside investment managers  and discussions are held as needed in order to make any impairment decisions 
each quarter any security deemed to have been other than temporarily impaired is written down to its then current market value  with the amount of the write down reflected in the statement of operations for that quarter 
previously impaired issues are also monitored monthly  with additional write downs taken quarterly if necessary 
there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments 
changes in circumstances and critical factors such as a continued weak economy  a pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies  industry sectors or countries could result in additional write downs in future periods for impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary 
reinsurance as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for loss protection to manage individual and aggregate risk exposure and concentration  to free up capital to allow us to write additional business and  in some cases  effect business dispositions 
we utilize ceded reinsurance for those product lines where there is exposure on a per risk basis or in the aggregate which exceeds our internal risk retention and concentration management guidelines 
reinsurance recoverables represent the portion of the policy and contract liabilities that are covered by reinsurance 
these liabilities include reserves for life  annuity  accident and health  policy and contract claims and other policyholder liabilities as shown in the consolidated balance sheets 
the cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the policies reinsured 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the methods used to determine the underlying liabilities reported in our and our predecessor s consolidated balance sheets 
under indemnity reinsurance transactions in which we are the ceding insurer  we remain liable for policy claims if the assuming company fails to meet its obligations 
in the event one or more assuming companies were to default on its obligations  it could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to limit this risk  we have implemented procedures to evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure 
in some cases  the reinsurers have placed amounts in trust that would be the equivalent of the recoverable amount and for which we are the beneficiary 
the selection of reinsurance companies is based on criteria related to solvency and reliability and  to a lesser degree  diversification 
an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers  reinsurer solvency  management experience and current economic conditions 
as of december   and  there was no allowance for doubtful accounts 
results of operations consolidated overview the following table presents historical consolidated financial information for each of the two years ended december  and for our predecessor 
historical financial information for the period from january  kmg america s date of inception  to december  and for the year ended december   for kmg america 
for financial reporting purposes  we have treated the kanawha acquisition as if it closed on december   rather than the actual closing date of december   as the effects of the acquisition for the period from december   through december   were not material 
accordingly  in the following discussion any financial information as of any date prior to  or for any period ending on or prior to  december   is reported on a historical basis without gaap purchase accounting adjustments reflecting the acquisition  and any financial information as of any date on or after  or for any period ending after  december   reflects gaap purchase accounting adjustments made as of december   reflecting the acquisition 
kmg america predecessor year ended december  for the period from january through december year ended december  dollars in thousands revenues insurance premiums net investment income commission and fees net realized gains other income total revenues benefits and expenses policyholder benefits commissions general expenses taxes  licenses and fees depreciation and amortization amortization of dac total benefits and expenses income before income taxes income taxes benefit income before cumulative effects of changes in accounting principle cumulative effect of accounting change net income benefits to premiums ratio n a net investment income for the year ended december   was negatively impacted by a million incentive payment to one of our predecessor s outside investment managers at the conclusion of the contract period 
there are no other incentive arrangements of this type in effect  and this contract was terminated upon the closing of kmg america s acquisition of kanawha 
the benefits to premiums ratio is equal to policyholder benefits divided by insurance premiums 
discussion of results by business segment the following section discusses significant factors that impact our revenues and insurance underwriting results segregated into the following five business segments worksite insurance business 
the worksite insurance business provides life and health insurance products to employers and their employees 
this business segment includes worksite business as well as individual insurance business sold directly to the end consumer and not considered part of the senior market business 
the primary insurance products sold by this business include life  short term disability  dental  indemnity health  employer excess risk and critical illness 
the earnings reported in any period for our worksite insurance business generally depends on growth in underwritten business  business mix  persistency of business in force  benefit payouts and administrative expenses incurred 
revenues are generated primarily from new and renewal premiums 
the worksite insurance business also includes business sold through our career agency distribution channel  which is a group of agents and managers that are our employees that sell life and health insurance products directly to individuals and small businesses 
senior market insurance business 
throughout the reporting period  the senior market insurance business provided individual insurance products  primarily long term care insurance  tailored to the needs of older individuals 
the level of operating earnings reported in any period during the reporting period for our senior market insurance business generally depended on growth in underwritten business  business mix  risk concentration  the ability to adjust premium rates  persistency of business in force  benefit payouts and administrative expenses incurred 
revenues were generated primarily from new and renewal premiums 
as a result of our decision to cease actively underwriting long term care insurance after december   operating earnings from this business segment will be dependent on our ability to adjust premium rates  persistency of business in force  benefit payouts and administrative expenses incurred 
revenues will be generated primarily from renewal premiums 
third party administration business 
the third party administration business provides administrative services to both the worksite insurance business and the senior insurance market business  as well as to third parties such as employers with self funded insured health plans  other insurance carriers who do not administer the plans they offer  reinsurers and managed care plans 
fees paid by our insurance operations to our third party administrative services subsidiary are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements  fees received from third parties for these services are recorded as commissions and fee income in our consolidated statements of operations 
costs associated with the operation of this business primarily reflect general overhead expenses and related information technology costs that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as general insurance expenses 
acquired business 
our predecessor obtained over time through assumption and indemnity reinsurance transactions  a number of blocks of life and health insurance business in which it has since elected to discontinue accepting new business 
revenue from this business reflects renewal premiums and other considerations on business in force that will continue to decline over time as policies lapse 
the earnings generated by acquired blocks of business in any period will be affected by  among other things  historical pricing levels together with approved premium rate increases if any  diversification of the underlying insurance policies  persistency and loss frequency and severity 
corporate and other 
the corporate and other segment includes investment income earned on the investment portfolio related to capital and surplus not allocated to the insurance segments 
this segment also includes marketing allowances  commissions and related expenses pertaining to product sales for other insurance carriers  which are currently not material 
in addition  this segment includes certain unallocated expenses  primarily deferred compensation and incentive compensation costs  and other unallocated immaterial items 
the results of this business segment are reflected in the following discussions of net investment income  realized investment gains and losses  and general insurance expenses 
definitions of insurance terms the following list includes definitions of insurance terms used in the discussion of our consolidated results of operations 
terms are listed in the order in which they appear in our consolidated statements of operations 
amortization of dac and voba dac relating to most insurance products is amortized over the premium paying period of related policies in a manner consistent with the establishment of benefit reserves 
the amortization of voba is comparable to the amortization of dac and is recognized using amortization schedules established at the time of acquisition based upon expected patterns of premiums  mortality  policy lapses and morbidity  and adjustments are made to take into account certain variances between expected and actual costs 
assumed premiums assumed premiums represent premiums written and issued by other insurance companies and subsequently reinsured by us 
benefits and expenses benefits and expenses consist primarily of policyholder benefits  insurance commissions  general insurance expenses  insurance taxes  licenses and fees  depreciation and amortization and the amortization of dac and voba 
benefits to premiums ratio benefits to premiums ratio equals policyholder benefits divided by net premiums 
in general  an increase in the ratio indicates a decrease in underwriting margins of the relevant business segment 
conversely  a decrease in the ratio generally indicates an increase in underwriting margins for the relevant business segment 
our management believes that this ratio is more meaningful in evaluating the changes in underwriting margins on our products from period to period than comparing absolute dollar changes in premiums and reserves because growth in net premiums produces corresponding increases in reserves 
ceded premiums ceded premiums represent premiums either written by or assumed by us and subsequently reinsured by other insurance companies 
commission and fee income commission and fee income consists of the commissions received by our insurance marketing business for the sale by us of insurance products underwritten by other insurance companies and fees generated by our third party administration business 
in addition  both of these businesses provide services to us 
the commission and fee income for services that these businesses provide to us is eliminated from the financial statement amounts referenced in this report 
depreciation and amortization this item includes depreciation of fixed assets such as information technology hardware and amortization of intangible assets such as software licenses 
this item is not discussed in detail in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations because it does not generally fluctuate significantly from period to period and is not a significant performance statistic considered by our management 
direct premiums direct premiums represent premiums on insurance products written and issued by us 
general insurance expenses general insurance expenses include primarily selling  general and administrative expenses incurred by corporate headquarters personnel in conducting operations including marketing  policy set up  administration  adjudication and customer service 
insurance commissions insurance commissions represent renewal commissions on products after the first anniversary date as well as first year commissions that are not deferred 
insurance taxes  licenses and fees insurance taxes  licenses and fees are primarily comprised of employment taxes  premium taxes and various filing fees required by the jurisdictions in which we do business 
net premiums net premiums represent the sum of direct premiums and assumed premiums  less ceded premiums 
new premiums new premiums represent premiums collected within the first twelve months following the initial policy date 
new sales new sales represent annualized premiums on new policies issued 
other income other income is comprised primarily of commission and expense allowances from reinsurance companies relating to insurance ceded from us to the reinsurance companies 
other operating measures these are measures that do not appear in the consolidated statement of operations  but are used by our management to evaluate our operating results 
policyholder benefits policyholder benefits consist of the policy benefit claims paid to policyholders and the increase or decrease in benefit reserves 
the primary factors affecting policyholder benefits are premium growth  claims experience and reserve assumptions including persistency  morbidity  mortality and interest rates 
premiums premiums are categorized as direct  assumed  ceded  and net 
each of these categories are further categorized as new or renewal 
renewal premiums renewal premiums represent the premiums derived from policies greater than twelve months from the original policy date 
revenues revenues consist primarily of premiums  net investment income  commission and fee income  realized investment gains and losses and other income 
consolidated results of operations the following discussion reflects our and our predecessor s results for the years ended december    and we were incorporated on january   and completed our initial public offering of common stock on december  concurrently with the completion of our initial public offering  we completed the acquisition of kanawha and its subsidiaries 
for financial reporting purposes  we have treated the acquisition as if it closed on december   rather than the actual closing date of december   as the effects of the acquisition for the period from december   through december   were not material 
our future results may not be consistent with the historical results of our predecessor 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the following represents a summary of our and our predecessor s statement of operations and asset composition by reportable segment 
except as noted  the financial statement information set forth below is reported on a historical basis without gaap purchase accounting adjustments reflecting the acquisition of the predecessor kmg america and predecessor kmg america predecessor for the year ended december  for the period from january through december  for the year ended december  worksite insurance business insurance premiums net investment income commission and fees net realized gains other income total revenues policyholder benefits commissions expenses  taxes  fees and depreciation amortization of dac total benefits and expenses loss before federal income tax total assets senior market insurance business insurance premiums net investment income commission and fees net realized gains other income total revenues policyholder benefits commissions expenses  taxes  fees and depreciation amortization of dac total benefits and expenses income before federal income tax total assets third party administration business insurance premiums net investment income commission and fees net realized gains other income total revenues policyholder benefits commissions expenses  taxes  fees and depreciation amortization of dac total benefits and expenses income before federal income tax total assets acquired business insurance premiums net investment income commissions and fees net realized gains other income total revenues policyholder benefits commissions expenses  taxes  fees and depreciation amortization of dac total benefits and expenses income loss before federal income tax total assets corporate and other insurance premiums net investment income commissions and fees net realized gains other income total revenues policyholder benefits commissions expenses  taxes  fees and depreciation amortization of dac total benefits and expenses income before federal income tax total assets total company insurance premiums net investment income commissions and fees net realized gains other income total revenues policyholder benefits commissions expenses  taxes  fees and depreciation amortization of dac total benefits and expenses income loss before federal income tax total assets n a kmg america at december   adjusted for purchase accounting adjustments to reflect the kanawha acquisition 
aggregate total assets for our predecessor as of december   is not reported because our predecessor had been acquired by kmg america at that date and our predecessor s assets had been consolidated into the kmg america balance sheet at that date 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  financial results overview net income for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million from net income of million in the decrease in net income was primarily due to decreases in revenues as the result of decreases in net realized gains offset by increases in premiums 
in addition there were increases in expenses offset by decreases in policyholder benefits  all of which are described in greater detail below 
revenues total revenues for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million from total revenues of million in the primary factors causing the fluctuations are explained below under the captions premiums  net investment income commission and fee income realized investment gains and losses and other income 
premiums the following table presents the distribution of premiums by type and business segment 
for the year ended december  for the year ended december  increase decrease worksite senior acquired total worksite senior acquired total worksite senior acquired total dollars in millions direct new renewal total assumed new renewal total ceded new renewal total net new renewal total worksite net new premiums increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   due to increased sales volumes 
new sales increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   due to increased emphasis on this core business segment 
net renewal premiums increased million  or  due to the increased amount of insurance in force created by prior year sales 
senior market net new premiums decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   due to a decrease in new sales 
new sales decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  a sales decline that began in mid  resulting from the discontinuance of an older product and the introduction of a new product with significantly higher premiums  continued into in addition  decisions were made to no longer actively underwrite long term care insurance policies after december  and to close our primary long term care distribution office in october  we intend to retain and actively manage the existing in force block of long term care 
net renewal premiums increased million  or  due to the increased amount of insurance in force created by prior year sales 
this increase is reflected in both the direct renewal premiums and the ceded renewal premiums 
acquired business premiums decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  neither we nor our predecessor has acquired any blocks of business since and the decline is a result of policy lapses 
net investment income net investment income increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  net investment income for was negatively impacted by a non recurring million incentive payment to one of kanawha s outside investment managers at the conclusion of the contract period 
excluding this item  net investment income increased million in the year ended december  net investment income is primarily affected by changes in levels of invested assets and interest rates 
the increase in investment income in occurred as a result of an increase in total cash and investments of approximately million that occurred in conjunction with the completion of our initial public offering on december  these proceeds were held in short term investments or cash equivalents for the majority of  which produced lower effective yields for that portion of the portfolio 
invested assets increased by million or  to million as of december   from million as of december   reflecting the investment of cash generated by asset sales and our initial public offering 
generally  increases in cash and invested assets are due to retention of premiums to establish policy reserves for the payment of future policyholder benefits 
the average yield on cash and invested assets on an amortized cost basis was for the year ended december   compared to an average yield of for the year ended december   excluding the effects of the non recurring million incentive payment to one of kanawha s outside investment managers 
this decline resulted from lower interest rates combined with the significantly larger amount of assets held in cash for a significant period of time during the year ended december  the incentive payment made in was charged directly to the corporate and other segment  while all other net investment income is allocated to our various business segments on a pro rata basis based on the invested assets attributed to the business segment 
in conjunction with the application of gaap purchase accounting requirements  assets attributed to the worksite insurance business  the senior insurance business and the acquired business all increased at december  for  total assets attributed to the worksite insurance business have not experienced any significant fluctuations 
total assets attributed to the senior market insurance business have increased significantly due to the accumulation of long term care insurance premiums retained to establish policy reserves for the payment of future policyholder benefits 
assets attributed to the third party administration business consist primarily of operating cash and receivables with respect to administrative claims payments awaiting settlement 
these assets are subject to significant variations due to timing of payments made  and there is no investment income attributed to them 
assets attributed to the acquired business have declined since as a result of policy lapses and the fact that no blocks of business have been acquired since assets attributed to the corporate and other segment are subject to significant fluctuations because changes in unrealized gains are all allocated to the corporate and other segment 
commission and fee income commission and fee income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  most of the commission and fee income was from administrative fees relating to third party administration 
the increase was due to an increase in business in force resulting from increased sales of our administrative services 
realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses occur as a result of the sale or impairment of investments 
the net realized investment gain in the year ended december  decreased by million to million from million in the year ended december  the net gain realized on fixed maturity securities in the year ended december   totaled million compared to a net gain realized on fixed maturity securities of million in the year ended december  in  our predecessor s investment committee elected to take advantage of favorable market conditions for fixed maturity securities by selling certain fixed maturity securities to recognize gains 
realized gains on fixed maturity securities in and were negatively impacted by impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
the net gain realized on equity securities in the year ended december   totaled million compared to a net gain realized on equity securities of million for the year ended december  the gains on equity securities were due to our predecessor s investment committee s election to take advantage of favorable market conditions by selling certain common stocks to recognize gains on these sales 
realized gains on equity securities in and were negatively impacted by impairment charges of million and  respectively 
the net gain realized on other investments in the year ended december   totaled million compared to a net gain realized on other investments of million for the year ended december  other investments represent the assets purchased to support the deferred compensation liability of the company  and realized gains and or losses are directly offset with increases and or decreases in compensation expenses 
realized investment gains and losses are allocated entirely to the corporate and other business segment 
other income other income increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  in  other income includes million of proceeds from litigation settlements  resulting from our participation in various class action litigations 
the remaining increases reflect increased commission and expense allowances from reinsurance companies generated from an increase in renewal ceded premiums 
benefits and expenses total benefits and expenses increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the primary factors causing this increase are explained below under the captions policyholder benefits  insurance commissions  general insurance expenses  insurance taxes  licenses and fees and amortization of dac and voba 
policyholder benefits policyholder benefits decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this produced a benefits to premium ratio of in compared to in the benefits to premium ratio declined primarily as a result of the gaap purchase accounting adjustments described in the next three paragraphs 
worksite marketing policyholder benefits decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this produced benefits to premium ratios of for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  in accordance with gaap purchase accounting requirements  policy and contract reserves were recorded at fair value on december  this adjustment produced increased reserve balances  which should result in smaller reserve increases in the near future 
the benefits to premium ratio decreased primarily as a result of this reduction in the increase in policy and contract reserves 
senior market policyholder benefits decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this produced benefits to premium ratios of for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  in accordance with gaap purchase accounting requirements  policy and contract reserves were recorded at fair value on december  this adjustment produced increased reserve balances  which should result in smaller reserve increases in the near future 
the benefits to premium ratio decreased primarily as a result of this reduction in the increase in policy and contract reserves  partially offset by an increase in open active claims due to an increase in the number of policies in force and the aging of our policyholders  which resulted in increases in actual claims paid and additional claims reserves 
acquired business policyholder benefits decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this produced benefits to premium ratios of for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  these benefits to premium ratios are affected by large portions of the acquired business that are no longer premium paying with substantial reserves and investment income on reserves 
in accordance with gaap purchase accounting requirements  policy and contract reserves were recorded at fair value on december  this adjustment produced increased reserve balances  which should result in smaller reserve increases in the near future 
the benefits to premium ratio decreased primarily as a result of this reduction in the increase in policy and contract reserves 
insurance commissions commission expenses decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this change resulted from normal fluctuations related to renewal premiums 
general insurance expenses general insurance expenses increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  general insurance expenses for include approximately million of incremental costs associated with our continuing expansion to a national insurance company  including the addition of management and marketing personnel  occupancy costs  infrastructure development  back office expenses  director and officer and related types of insurance coverage  and costs associated with being a public company 
overhead expenses that are not directly associated with a particular business segment are allocated to the various business segments on a pro rata basis based on different factors  such as headcount  policy count  number of policies issued  premiums and other relevant factors 
during  we incurred million in defense costs related to the reliastar litigation and shut down costs of million associated with the sale of our ft 
myers based senior market insurance agency office 
we also incurred deferred compensation expenses of million associated with the increase in market value of the deferred compensation plan assets 
the deferred compensation expenses are directly offset with realized investment gains of the same amount insurance taxes  licenses and fees insurance taxes  licenses and fees were unchanged at million in the years ended december  and premium income  which drives premium taxes  was relatively flat between and amortization of dac and voba first year commissions and general insurance expenses associated with the acquisition of new business are deferred and amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies 
the total deferrals of policy acquisition costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in deferrals was primarily due to the increase in net new premiums in the worksite segment somewhat offset by the decrease in net new long term care premiums in the senior market 
our predecessor assigned a value to the insurance in force of acquired companies or blocks of insurance business at the date of acquisition 
no companies or blocks of business were acquired in or the amortization of dac and voba decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  in accordance with gaap purchase accounting requirements  our predecessor s dac and voba were eliminated  and a new voba was established for the value of the in force business as of december  this adjustment resulted in decreased dac and voba balances  which cause smaller amortization charges going forward 
provision for income taxes total income taxes may differ from the amount computed by applying the federal corporate tax rate of due to tax advantaged investments and net operating loss carry forwards available 
the effective income tax rates for the years ended december   and were and respectively 
the variations in these rates is due to the fact that a portion of our consolidated income for the year ended december  resulted from a subsidiary that has net operating loss carry forwards available 
due to the uncertainty of using these net operating losses  a valuation allowance had been established offsetting the deferred tax asset  therefore  the tax on the net income from this subsidiary has been offset by the release of the associated valuation allowance  which reduces the effective tax rate for the consolidated company 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  financial results overview net income for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million from net income of million in the decrease in net income was primarily due to decreases in premiums and net investment income and an increase in policyholder benefits  partially offset by a decrease in general expenses  all of which are described in greater detail below 
revenues total revenues for the year ended december   decreased million  or  to million from total revenues of million in the primary factors causing the decrease are explained in the revenue related discussion below 
premiums the following table presents the distribution of premiums by type and business segment 
for the year ended december  for the year ended december  increase decrease worksite senior acquired total worksite senior acquired total worksite senior acquired total dollars in millions direct new renewal total assumed new renewal total ceded new renewal total net new renewal total worksite net new premiums decreased million  or  due to decreased sales volumes 
new sales decreased million in total  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  our predecessor stopped issuing annuities and medicare supplement policies in  but both of these products were offered for the majority of sales of our predecessor s products through its career agency distribution channel declined as a result 
new product sales distributed exclusively through worksite marketing increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended net renewal premiums increased million  or  due to the increased amount of insurance in force created by prior year sales 
senior market net new premiums decreased million  or  due to the combination of a decrease in direct new premiums and an increase in ceded new premiums 
direct new premiums decreased million  or  due to a decline in new sales 
new sales decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  a sales decline that began in mid  resulting from the discontinuance of an older product and the introduction of a new product with significantly higher premiums  continued into net new premiums also declined because the new product is reinsured to a greater degree than the discontinued product  resulting in an increase to ceded premiums 
the risk retained by kanawha was on the discontinued product compared to on the new product 
net renewal premiums increased million  or  due to the increased amount of insurance in force created by prior year sales 
this increase is reflected in both the direct renewal premiums and the ceded renewal premiums 
acquired business premiums decreased million  or  for the year ended december  we and our predecessor have not acquired any blocks of business since and the decline is a result of policy lapses and premium refunds that our predecessor was required to pay to ceding companies under some of its reinsurance agreements because its claims experience was better than contemplated in the agreements 
these premium refunds are offset by reductions in policyholder benefits 
net investment income net investment income declined million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the decline in was largely the result of an incentive payment of million to one of our predecessor s outside investment managers at the conclusion of the contract period as well as a decline in the yield on  and the dollar amount of  invested assets 
there are no other incentive arrangements of this type in effect  and this contract was terminated upon the closing of the kanawha acquisition 
net investment income is primarily affected by changes in levels of invested assets and interest rates 
the decline in investment income in the year ended december   occurred despite an increase in total cash and investments of million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december   excluding the effects of the kanawha acquisition 
invested assets declined to million as of december   from million as of december   because assets were sold in the last several months of and the proceeds of the sale of those assets were not reinvested as of december  this generated a corresponding increase in cash 
the increase in cash and invested assets is due to retention of premiums to establish policy reserves for the payment of future policyholder benefits 
the average yield on invested assets on an amortized cost basis was in the year ended december   compared to an average yield of in the year ended the continuing decline in prevailing interest rates and the sale of some higher yield investments  both in and  contributed to the decline in net investment income in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the million incentive payment paid to an outside investment manager in  which was recorded as a reduction of investment income  was charged directly to the corporate and other segment  resulting in a significant decline in investment income in this segment compared to all other net investment income is allocated to the various business segments on a pro rata basis based on the invested assets attributed to the business segment 
total assets attributed to the worksite insurance business have not experienced any significant fluctuations 
total assets attributed to the senior market insurance business have increased significantly due to the accumulation of long term care insurance premiums retained to establish policy reserves for the payment of future policyholder benefits 
assets attributed to the third party administration business consist primarily of operating cash and receivables with respect to administrative claims payments awaiting settlement 
these assets are subject to significant variations due to timing of payments made  and there is no investment income attributed to them 
assets attributed to the acquired business have declined since as a result of policy lapses and the fact that we and our predecessor have not acquired any blocks of business since assets attributed to the corporate and other segment are subject to significant fluctuations because changes in unrealized gains are all allocated to the corporate and other segment 
in conjunction with the application of gaap purchase accounting requirements  assets attributed to the worksite insurance business  the senior insurance business and the acquired business all increased 
commission and fee income commission and fee income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  most of the commission and fee income was from administrative fees relating to third party administration 
the increase was due to an increase in business in force resulting from increases in sales of our predecessor s administrative services 
realized investment gains and losses realized investment gains and losses occur as a result of the sale or impairment of investments 
the net realized investment gain in the year ended december   increased by million to million from million in the year ended december  the net gain realized on fixed maturity securities in the year ended december   totaled million compared to a net gain realized on fixed maturity securities of million in the year ended december  in both and  our predecessor s investment committee elected to take advantage of favorable market conditions for fixed maturity securities by selling certain fixed maturity securities to recognize gains 
realized gains on fixed maturity securities in and were negatively impacted by impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
the net gain realized on equity securities in the year ended december   totaled million compared to a net gain realized on equity securities of million for the year ended december  these net gains on equity securities were due to our predecessor s investment committee s election to take advantage of favorable market conditions by selling certain common stocks to recognize gains on these sales 
realized gains on equity securities in and were negatively impacted by impairment charges of million and  respectively 
realized investment gains and losses are allocated entirely to the corporate and other business segment 
other income other income increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   reflecting the increased commission and expense allowances from reinsurance companies generated from the increase in ceded premiums described in premiums above 
benefits and expenses total benefits and expenses decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the primary factors causing this increase are explained in policyholder benefits and general insurance expenses below 
policyholder benefits policyholder benefits increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this  in combination with the aforementioned decline in premiums  produced a benefits to premium ratio of in compared to in worksite marketing policyholder benefits decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this produced benefits to premium ratios of for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  while policyholder benefits decreased  a sales decline of million resulting from the discontinuation of annuities also produced a similar reduction in policyholder benefits  as reserve increases associated with this business were no longer required 
the benefits to premium ratio increased primarily as a result of unfavorable short term disability claims experience at a particular employer worksite 
actions have been taken to cease any new sales in that worksite 
senior market policyholder benefits increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this produced benefits to premium ratios of for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the primary reason for the ratio increase is an increase in open active claims  due to an increase in the number of policies in force and the aging of our predecessor s insureds  which resulted in increases in actual claims paid as well as additional claims reserves 
acquired business policyholder benefits decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this produced benefits to premium ratios of for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  these benefits to premium ratios are affected by large portions of the acquired business that are no longer premium paying  substantial reserves and investment income on reserves that is a primary component of this line of business 
the decline in policyholder benefits results from the fact that claims experience was better than contemplated under some of the related reinsurance agreements 
these better than contemplated policyholder benefits were offset by premium refunds that our predecessor was required to pay to the ceding companies because claims experience was favorable 
the primary reason for the increased benefits to premium ratio was an increase of million in policyholder benefits combined with a decrease of million in premiums on a block of insurance policies acquired from metropolitan life insurance company 
the increase in policyholder benefits on the metropolitan life insurance company business was due in part to several larger claims  but primarily reflects increased claims volume due to the aging of the business 
other than these benefit fluctuations  there were no significant changes in acquired business policyholder benefits from to insurance commissions commission expenses increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase is consistent with the increase in net renewal premiums for the non acquired business 
general insurance expenses general insurance expenses decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  general insurance expenses for and include approximately million and million  respectively  of costs to develop our predecessor s worksite marketing business 
in november  our predecessor outsourced the functions of its information technology department to cgi group  inc  which had a positive impact on expenses 
in addition  general expenses primarily in the third party administration business were negatively impacted in by information technology expenses attributable to administrative system conversions  as well as costs to comply with hipaa 
as a result  the third party administration business experienced a decrease in expenses in compared to  despite an increase in revenues 
overhead expenses that are not directly associated with a particular business segment are allocated to the various business segments on a pro rata basis based on different factors  such as headcount  policy count  number of policies issued  premiums and other relevant factors 
insurance taxes  licenses and fees insurance taxes  licenses and fees were unchanged at million in the years ended december  and premium income  which drives premium taxes  was relatively flat between and amortization of dac and voba our predecessor deferred first year commissions and general insurance expenses associated with the acquisition of new business 
the total deferrals of policy acquisition costs were million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in deferrals was primarily due to the decrease in net new long term care premiums in the senior market 
our predecessor also assigned a value to the insurance in force of acquired companies or blocks of insurance business at the date of acquisition 
no companies or blocks of business were acquired in or the amortization of dac and voba decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  in the year ended december   amortization is composed of dac amortization of million and voba amortization of million 
the amortization is composed of dac amortization of million and voba amortization of million 
we eliminated all of our predecessor s dac upon the closing of the kanawha acquisition as part of the application of gaap purchase accounting requirements 
we began recording dac prospectively on january  we eliminated all of our predecessor s historical voba upon the closing of the kanawha acquisition as part of our application of gaap purchase accounting requirements 
we simultaneously re established voba for the value of our predecessor s in force business 
voba interest rate assumptions to amortize the voba were also reset upon the closing of the acquisition and the rate was approximately at december  provision for income taxes total income taxes may differ from the amount computed by applying the federal corporate tax rate of due to tax advantaged investments and a kanawha subsidiary s net operating loss carry forward  and because any losses incurred in that subsidiary do not generate tax benefits because of the uncertainty of future operating gains

loss impairment 
all fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and marked to market through other comprehensive income 
all securities with gross unrealized losses at the consolidated balance sheet date are subjected to our process for identifying other than temporary impairments 
securities deemed to be other than temporarily impaired are written down to fair value in the period the securities are deemed to be so impaired 
the assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
management considers a wide range of factors  as described below  about the issuer of the security and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing its prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by management in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to  the following length of time and the extent to which the market value of the security has been below amortized cost  when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  a review of all securities of the issuer  including its known subsidiaries and affiliates  conditions of the industry sector or subsector in which the issuer operates  economic conditions in the issuer s geographic location  catastrophic loss suffered by the issuer or the industry in which the issuer operates  and other subjective factors  including information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
the review of fixed maturity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the total gross unrealized losses for three categories of securities securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by less than  securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by or more for less than six months  and securities where the estimated value had declined and remained below amortized cost by or more for six months or greater 
securities in the first two categories have generally been adversely impacted by the downturn in the financial markets  overall economic conditions and certain industry trends 
the first category generally includes securities that have declined in value as a result of fluctuations in interest rates  rather than due to difficulties experienced by the issuer of the securities 
while all of these securities are monitored for potential impairment  our and our experience indicates that securities in the first two categories do not present as great a risk of impairment  and securities in these categories often recover their fair value over time as the factors that caused the declines improve 
in addition  the company has the intent and ability to hold these securities until they recover in value 
writedowns are recorded as investment losses and the cost bases of the securities are adjusted accordingly 
the revised cost basis is not changed for subsequent recoveries in value 
writedowns of fixed maturities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these writedowns reflected other than temporary impairments on delta airlines and triton aviation fixed income securities 
both of these securities have been impacted by the negative conditions affecting the airline industry generally 
delta s credit rating was downgraded twice during and the value of the triton securities continued a decline for which an impairment of million was recognized in writedowns of equity securities were million for the year ended december   reflecting poor operating results and a market value decline in excess of percent on verso technologies  inc reserves the following table presents insurance policy benefit and contract related liabilities information as of the dates indicated  by reserve type kmg america as of december  dollars in thousands life and annuity reserves accident and health reserves policy and contract claims other policyholder liabilities total policy liabilities life and annuity reserves decreased by million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december  a large portion of the life and annuity reserves relates to acquired blocks of business that are lapsing at a steady pace because no new blocks of business have been acquired since these blocks represented million of the decrease in reserves for the year ended december   and million of the decrease in reserves for the year ended december  accident and health reserves increased by million or  to million as of december   from million as of december  these reserve increases are consistent with growth in the underlying business  with the majority of the reserve growth being accumulated from long term care premiums received 
policy and contract claims  which represent liabilities for actual claims reported and payable  increased by million  or  to million as of december   from million as of december  this increase represents timing of claims received and processed  and although there are always fluctuations in policy and contract claim reserves from period to period  there were no significant events or trends during the periods discussed in this paragraph that would produce any material changes in our claims reserves

participating premiums as a percentage of direct life premiums were in  in and in ceded reinsurance as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for loss protection to manage individual and aggregate risk exposure and concentration  to free up capital to allow us to write additional business and  in some cases  effect business dispositions 
we utilize ceded reinsurance for those product lines where there is exposure on a per risk basis or in the aggregate which exceeds our internal risk retention and concentration management guidelines 
reinsurance recoverables represent the portion of the policy and contract liabilities that are covered by reinsurance 
these liabilities include reserves for life  annuity  accident and health  policy and contract claims and other policyholder liabilities as shown in the consolidated balance sheets 
the cost of reinsurance is accounted for over the terms of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the policies reinsured 
amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the methods used to determine the underlying liabilities reported in the consolidated balance sheets

in the event one or more assuming companies were to default on its obligations  it could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to limit this risk  we have implemented procedures to evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and to monitor the concentration of credit risk to minimize this exposure 
in some cases  the reinsurers have placed amounts in trust that would be the equivalent of the recoverable amount and for which we are the beneficiary 
the selection of reinsurance companies is based on criteria related to solvency and reliability and  to a lesser degree  diversification 
an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers  reinsurer solvency  management experience and current economic conditions

kmg america s assets consist primarily of the capital stock of kanawha and its other non insurance subsidiaries 
accordingly  kmg america s cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends and other statutorily permissible payments  such as payments under tax allocation agreements and under management agreements  from kanawha 
kanawha s ability to pay dividends and to make other payments is limited primarily by applicable laws and regulations of south carolina  the state in which kanawha is domiciled  which subjects insurance operations to significant regulatory restrictions 
these laws and regulations require  among other things  that kanawha  kmg america s insurance subsidiary  maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends it can pay to the holding company 
solvency regulations  capital requirements  types of insurance offered and rating agency status are some of the factors used in determining the amount of capital available for dividends 
in general  south carolina will permit annual dividends from insurance operations equal to the greater of the most recent calendar year s statutory net income or of total capital and surplus of the insurance operations at the end of the previous calendar year  provided that the dividend payment does not exceed earned surplus  in which case further limitations apply 
for  the maximum amount of dividends that kanawha can pay to kmg america under applicable laws and regulations without prior regulatory approval is million 
if kmg america is able to successfully execute its business plan and accelerate kanawha s earnings growth in its insurance operations  kmg america expects that the maximum allowable dividend from kanawha to the holding company will increase at an accelerated rate year over year 
if the ability of kanawha to pay dividends or make other payments to kmg america is materially restricted by regulatory requirements  it could adversely affect kmg america s ability to pay any dividends on its common stock and or service its debt and pay its other corporate expenses 
the primary sources of funds for kmg america s subsidiaries consist of insurance premiums and other considerations  fees and commissions collected  proceeds from the sales and maturity of investments and investment income 
cash is primarily used to pay insurance claims  agent commissions  operating expenses  product surrenders and withdrawals and taxes 
kmg america generally invests its subsidiaries excess funds in order to generate income 
the primary use of dividends and other distributions from subsidiaries to kmg america will be to pay certain expenses of the holding company 
we currently have no intention of paying dividends to our shareholders and will reinvest cash flows from operations into our businesses for the foreseeable future 
kmg america has outstanding debt of approximately million because a portion of the purchase price for the kanawha acquisition was paid in the form of a million subordinated promissory note with a five year term beginning on the closing date of the acquisition 
interest on the promissory note is accruing at per annum and is added to the principal balance on december of each year and is payable on the maturity date 
no cash payments are required under the promissory note until maturity  at which time approximately million of principal and accrued interest will be due and payable 
the terms of the promissory note limit kmg america s and kanawha s ability to incur additional debt 
kmg america maintains a million line of credit available to meet short term cash flow needs 
we are seeking to expand our available credit facilities in order to maximize financial flexibility and are considering adding leverage to our capital structure 
our qualified defined benefit pension plan was under funded by million as of december   with an actuarially determined projected benefit obligation of million as opposed to plan assets of million 
in  we made contributions to the pension fund of million 
in accordance with erisa  there was no expected minimum funding requirement for this plan for the year ended december  based on the plan s current funding status and erisa and irs guidelines  no required contributions to the plan are anticipated for we are not currently planning to make any other significant capital expenditures or acquisitions in or subsequent years 
however  we plan to significantly expand outlays relating to marketing and sales activities over the next several years including outlays required to build a national sales organization  which is a key component of our strategy 
these outlays will include expenses such as salaries and cash incentive compensation  employee benefits  occupancy and information technology expenses of additional sales personnel  advertising and marketing costs  consulting and recruiting 
the execution of our business plan will require additional outlays associated with the development of a national insurance company including home office expenses for executive management and additional financial  actuarial and underwriting personnel  infrastructure development and back office expenses  as well as costs associated with our being a public company 
we anticipate that these costs will be offset over time by increased sales production resulting from hiring additional sales personnel and increased cross selling  as well as efficiencies resulting from greater scale 
cash flows we monitor cash flows at both the consolidated and subsidiary levels 
cash flow forecasts at the consolidated and subsidiary levels are provided on a monthly basis  and we use trend and variance analyses to project future cash needs  making adjustments to the forecasts when needed 
the table below shows the company s and our predecessor s recent net cash flows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash cash flows for the years ended december   and in the table shown above  increases in net cash provided by operating activities generally result from collected premiums while decreases in net cash flow provided by investing activities generally are a result of the investment of collected premiums 
policy and contract liabilities increase when premiums collected are retained to establish policy reserves 
the portions of these liabilities that are reinsured by reinsurance companies are reflected in reinsurance balances recoverable 
as a function of our third party administration business  we manage insurance funds for our clients 
these funds are held in suspense accounts pending appropriate disposition  and the balances held in suspense vary on a day to day basis as insurance funds are received and applied by us 
other changes in cash flows for the years ended december    and are as follows we held approximately million in cash at december   primarily consisting of cash proceeds from sales and maturities of our invested assets and from our initial public offering of common stock 
we invested a significant portion of this cash in fixed maturity securities in  resulting in the net cash outflow from investing activities of million 
this produced a corresponding increase in invested assets 
other assets increased by million in  primarily representing a million prepaid pension asset  offset by the receipt of a million receivable for a securities trade that had not settled as of december  accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by million in  primarily due to a million increase in reinsurance settlements due related to the acquired business 
the liability for benefits for employees and agents increased by million in  primarily resulting from additional pension plan liability accruals of million established to fund future payments under the pension plan as well as additional deferred compensation balances of million 
federal income tax recoverable increased by million in as a result of losses incurred in kanawha insurance company that will be carried back to prior years 
the deferred tax asset increased by million and the deferred tax liability increased by million 
the combination of the three items resulted in a net decrease in tax liabilities of million  inclusive of a decrease of million related to the decrease in fair market value of invested assets 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased by million in  primarily due to an increase in reinsurance payables of million relating to acquired business  and a decrease in accrued compensation expense of million relating to payments of accrued compensation that were made in other assets decreased by million in  primarily due to the timing of payments and receipts from our reinsurers 
the liability for benefits for employees and agents decreased by million in as the result of payments for accrued pension plan contributions of million 
the remaining increase is attributable to additional pension plan liability accruals of million established to fund future payments under the pension plan 
in  our predecessor had realized gains of million primarily due to its decision to sell its convertible bond portfolio and the majority of its equity securities 
these realized gains were higher than the gains in  although the activity levels for sales and purchases was significantly lower than in in connection with our acquisition of kanawha in  outstanding kanawha stock options were exercised  resulting in cash receipts of million and a tax benefit of million 
the exercise of these outstanding stock options produced the majority of the million increase in federal income tax recoverable 
reinsurance recoverables increased significantly by million in the key  non routine component of the increase was the result of ceding million of reserves associated with the annuity block of business to madison national life insurance company 
other assets increased by million in as the result of a reclassification of assets pertaining to an employee deferred compensation plan from available for sale to trading  offset by a decrease in common stock 
the liability for benefits for employees and agents decreased by million in as the result of payments for accrued pension plan contributions of million 
the remaining increase is attributable to additional pension plan liability accruals of million established to fund future payments under the pension plan

a counterparty is any person or entity from which cash or other forms of consideration are expected to extinguish a liability or obligation to us 
primarily  our credit risk exposure is concentrated in our fixed income investment portfolio and  to a lesser extent  in our reinsurance recoverables 
inflation risk is the possibility that a change in domestic price levels produces an adverse effect on earnings 
this typically happens when only one of invested assets or liabilities is indexed to inflation 
foreign exchange risk is the possibility that changes in exchange rates produce an adverse effect on earnings and equity when measured in domestic currency 
this risk is most significant when assets backing liabilities payable in one currency are invested in financial instruments of another currency 
interest rate risk we invest substantial funds in interest sensitive fixed income assets  such as fixed maturity investments  mortgage backed and asset backed securities and mortgage loans  primarily in the united states 
we are exposed to two forms of interest rate risk price risk and reinvestment risk 
price risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these investments 
as interest rates rise  the market value of these investments falls  and conversely  as interest rates fall  the market value of these investments rises 
reinvestment risk occurs when fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on expected cash flows from mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
as interest rates fall  an increase in prepayments on these assets results in earlier than expected receipt of cash flows  forcing us to reinvest the proceeds in an unfavorable lower interest rate environment  and conversely as interest rates rise  a decrease in prepayments on these assets results in later than expected receipt of cash flows  forcing us to forgo reinvesting in a favorable higher interest rate environment 
as of december   we held million of fixed maturity securities at fair market value and million of mortgage loans for a combined total of of total invested assets 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk in establishing our policy benefit reserves 
life insurance  disability and other policy benefit reserves are discounted at the valuation date using a valuation interest rate 
the valuation interest rate is determined by taking into consideration actual and expected earned rates on our asset portfolio  with adjustments for investment expenses and provisions for adverse deviation 
equity price risk we manage equity price risk on an integrated basis with other risks through our asset and liability management strategies 
risk exposures to equity securities are also managed through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation 
asset and liability management we evaluate interest rate risk by periodically projecting our asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of our securities investments and liabilities to interest rate movements 
creating these projections involves evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of our in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments 
we manage interest rate risk and attempt to mitigate against a mismatch greater than acceptable tolerance levels in the duration of our assets and liabilities by selecting investments with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that are tailored to allow us to meet the anticipated cash outflow characteristics of our insurance and reinsurance liabilities 
we believe that the duration of our invested assets are appropriate for our business given the nature of our liabilities and the current interest rate environment 
liability durations cannot be calculated precisely due to the uncertainty of the timing and amount of liability cash flows 
as a result  there is no generally recognized method of computation of liability durations 
for acquired blocks of business and other products  the average duration of the associated assets is within or close to the liability duration range 
for long term care  the liability duration range is longer than the average duration of the associated assets 
this duration mismatch results in reinvestment risk when assets mature prior to the termination of the associated liabilities and funds must be reinvested  but does not result in liquidity risk 
however  we do not believe that this reinvestment risk is significant given our belief that future investment conditions will be at least as favorable as present conditions 
as a result of the duration profile of our investment portfolio and product liabilities  as well as our internal cash flow projections  we do not anticipate having to dispose of investment securities at inopportune times and or market prices or access credit facilities to obtain required liquidity in the future 
the interest rate sensitivity of our fixed maturity security assets is assessed using hypothetical test scenarios that assume several positive and negative parallel shifts of the underlying yield curve 
the individual securities are repriced under each scenario using a valuation model 
for investments such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities  a prepayment model was used in conjunction with a valuation model 
our actual experience may differ from the results noted below if actual experience differs from assumptions utilized or if events occur that were not included in the assumptions 
the following table summarizes the results of this analysis for fixed maturity securities held in our investment portfolio interest rate movement analysis of market value of fixed maturity securities investment portfolio as of december  basis point change dollars in millions total market value change in market value from base case change in market value from base case asset and liability management is currently the responsibility of our investment committee and chief actuary  which are responsible for setting a broad asset and liability management policy and strategy  reviewing and approving target portfolios  establishing investment guidelines and limits and providing oversight of the portfolio management process 
the portfolio managers and asset sector specialists that have been assigned by our third party investment managers and who have responsibility on a day to day basis for risk management of their respective investing activities implement the goals and objectives established by our investment committee 
the goals of the investment process are to optimize after tax  risk adjusted current investment income and after tax  risk adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis 
the risk management objectives established by our investment committee stress quality  diversification  asset liability matching  liquidity and investment return 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk primarily as a holder of fixed income securities and as a party to reinsurance cessions 
our risk management strategy and investment policy is to invest in debt instruments of issuers with high credit ratings and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to any one issuer 
we attempt to limit our credit exposure by imposing fixed maturity portfolio limits on individual issuers based upon credit ratings 
currently  our portfolio limits are for issuers rated aaa  for issuers rated aa to aa  for issuers a to a  for issuers rated bbb to bbb and for issuers rated bb to bb 
these portfolio limits are further reduced for some issuers with whom we have credit exposure on reinsurance agreements 
we use the lower of moody s or standard poor s ratings to determine an issuer s rating 
the following table presents our fixed maturity investment portfolio by ratings of the nationally recognized securities rating organizations as of december  rating carrying value percentage of total dollars in thousands aaa aa a bbb bb b and lower total we are also exposed to the credit risk of our reinsurers 
when we reinsure  we are still liable to our insureds regardless of whether we receive reimbursement from our reinsurer 
in the event one or more of our reinsurers defaults on its obligations  it could adversely affect our financial condition and the results of our operations 
as part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy  we purchase reinsurance for some risks underwritten by our various businesses 
approximately of our million of reinsurance recoverables at december   are protected from credit risk because the reinsurer has placed amounts in a trust account that is pledged to us 
the trust account values are at least equal to the recoverable amounts from the underlying reinsurance agreements 
for recoverables that are not protected by these mechanisms  we depend solely on the credit of the reinsurer 
substantially all of our reinsurance exposure has been ceded to companies rated a or better by am best 
inflation risk we are exposed to inflation risk because we invest substantial funds in nominal assets  which are not indexed to the level of inflation  but the underlying liabilities are indexed to the level of inflation 
life insurance policies with reserves of approximately million as of december  representing of our total reserves  have death benefits that are guaranteed to grow based on inflation linked indices 
substantially all of these policies are subject to caps that limit the amount by which the death benefits can grow each year 
in times of rapidly rising inflation the credited death benefit growth on these liabilities increases relative to the investment income earned on the nominal assets  resulting in an adverse impact on earnings 
in addition  we are exposed to inflation risk with respect to some major medical insurance policies to the extent that medical costs increase with inflation at a greater pace than our ability to increase premiums 
foreign exchange risk we have no exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from our insurance and other business operations 
we also have little foreign exchange exposure in our investment portfolio 
total invested assets from foreign issuers were less than of our total invested assets at december   but all of these foreign investments were denominated in dollars 
derivatives derivatives are financial instruments whose values are derived from interest rates  foreign exchange rates  financial indices or the prices of securities or commodities 
derivative financial instruments may be exchange traded or contracted in the over the counter market and include swaps  futures  options and forward contracts 
under insurance statutes  insurance companies may use derivative financial instruments to hedge actual or anticipated changes in their assets or liabilities  to replicate cash market instruments or for some income generating activities 
these statutes generally prohibit the use of derivatives for speculative purposes 
prior to the completion of the kanawha acquisition  our predecessor historically had not used derivative financial instruments 
however  we are considering and in the future may elect to utilize derivatives in order to hedge some exposures
