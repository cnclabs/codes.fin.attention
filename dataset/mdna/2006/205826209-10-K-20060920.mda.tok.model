item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop  produce and market innovative products  systems and services for advanced communications solutions 
we believe many of our solutions play a vital role in providing or enhancing communication capabilities when terrestrial communications infrastructure is unavailable or ineffective 
we conduct our business through three complementary segments telecommunications transmission  mobile data communications and rf microwave amplifiers 
we sell our products to a diverse customer base in the global commercial and government communications markets 
we believe we are a leader in the market segments that we serve 
our telecommunications transmission segment  which is currently our largest business segment  provides sophisticated equipment and systems that are used to enhance satellite transmission efficiency and that enable wireless communications in environments where terrestrial communications are unavailable  inefficient or too expensive 
our mobile data communications segment  currently our fastest growing segment  provides customers with an integrated solution including mobile satellite transceivers and satellite network support to enable global satellite based communications when mobile  real time  secure transmission is required for applications including logistics  support and battlefield command and control applications 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment designs  manufactures and markets solid state  high power  broadband rf microwave amplifier products 
a substantial portion of our sales may be derived from a limited number of relatively large customer contracts  the timing of revenues from which cannot be predicted 
quarterly and period to period sales and operating results may be significantly affected by one or more of such contracts 
in addition  our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products  systems and services sold  production efficiencies  estimates of warranty expense  price competition and general economic conditions 
our gross profit may also be affected by the impact of any cumulative adjustments to contracts that are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
accordingly  we can experience significant fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter and period to period comparisons may not be indicative of future performance 
revenue from the sale of our products is generally recognized when the earnings process is complete  upon shipment or customer acceptance 
revenue from contracts relating to the design  development or manufacturing of complex electronic equipment to a buyer s specification or to provide services relating to the performance of such contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
revenue from contracts that contain multiple elements that are not accounted for under the percentage of completion method are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue from these contracts is allocated to each respective element based on each element s relative fair value and is recognized when the respective revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
our contract with the united states us army for the movement tracking system mts is for an eight year period ending in july and revenue recognition is based on the percentage of completion method 
the gross margin is based on the estimated sales and expenses for the entire eight year contract 
the amount of revenue recognized has been limited to the amount of funded orders received from the us army 
through the end of our fiscal quarter ended october   we recognized revenue on the portion of such orders that relate to prepaid service time when the time was used by the customer 
as a result of changes to the manner in which our technology is being deployed and used  commencing november   we are recognizing service time revenue based on a network availability method which recognizes prepaid service time on a straight line basis from the date of shipment through the end of the contract term in july recent acquisitions in may  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of memotec  inc memotec  a subsidiary of kontron ag  and at the same time  purchased related inventory owned by kontron canada inc  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million in cash 
commencing in may  memotec s results of operations have been included in our telecommunications transmission segment 
in february  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of tolt technologies  inc tolt for an aggregate purchase price of million  including transaction costs of million 
in fiscal  we significantly de emphasized stand alone sales of tolt s turnkey employee mobility solutions  and are focusing our efforts on selling commercial satellite based mobile data applications 
this operation is part of our mobile data communications segment 
in august  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of insite consulting  inc insite  a logistics application software company  for million  plus certain earn out payments based on the achievement of future sales targets 
the first part of the earn out cannot exceed million and is limited to a five year period 
the second part of the earn out  which is for a ten year period  is unlimited and based on a per unit future sales target primarily relating to new commercial satellite based mobile data communications markets 
insite has developed the geoops enterprise location monitoring system  a software based solution that allows customers to integrate legacy data systems with near real time logistics and operational data systems 
this operation was combined with our existing business and is part of our mobile data communications segment 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies to be critical due to the estimation process involved in each 
revenue recognition on long term contracts 
revenues and related costs from long term contracts relating to the design  development or manufacturing of complex electronic equipment to a buyer s specification or to provide services relating to the performance of such contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
revenue is recognized based on the relationship of total costs incurred to total projected costs  or  alternatively  based on output measures  such as units delivered 
profits expected to be realized on such contracts are based on total estimated sales for the contract compared to total estimated costs  including warranty costs  at completion of the contract 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are made cumulative to the date of the change 
the impact of any such adjustments discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations represents the cumulative impact of the adjustment on the relevant financial statement amount as of the beginning of the period being discussed 
estimated losses on long term contracts are recorded in the period in which the losses become evident 
some of our largest contracts  including our mts contract with the us army  are accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
we have been engaged in the production and delivery of goods and services on a continual basis under contractual arrangements for many years 
historically  we have demonstrated an ability to accurately estimate revenues and expenses relating to our long term contracts 
however  there exist inherent risks and uncertainties in estimating revenues  expenses and progress toward completion  particularly on larger or longer term contracts 
if we do not accurately estimate the total sales  related costs and progress towards completion on such contracts  the estimated gross margins may be significantly impacted or losses may need to be recognized in future periods 
any such resulting changes in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  most government contracts have termination for convenience clauses that provide the customer with the right to terminate the contract at any time 
such terminations could impact the assumptions regarding total contract revenues and expenses utilized in recognizing profit under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
changes to these assumptions could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
historically  we have not experienced material terminations of our long term contracts 
we also address customer acceptance provisions in assessing our ability to perform our contractual obligations under long term contracts 
our inability to perform on our long term contracts could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
historically  we have been able to perform on our long term contracts 
accounting for stock based compensation 
as discussed further in notes to consolidated financial statements note j accounting for stock based compensation  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r on august  using the modified prospective method 
through july   we accounted for our stock option and employee stock purchase plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 and as a result no compensation costs had been recognized in our historical consolidated statements of operations 
we have used and expect to continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of stock based awards 
the black scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected option term and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of stock based awards reflect our best estimates  but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
we estimate expected volatility by considering the historical volatility of our stock  the implied volatility of publicly traded stock options in our stock and our expectations of volatility for the expected term of stock based compensation awards 
as a result  if other assumptions or estimates had been used for options granted in and in prior periods  the stock based compensation expense that was recorded for fiscal could have been materially different 
furthermore  if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of july   our company s goodwill and other intangible assets aggregated million 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
any such resulting impairment charges could be material to our results of operations 
provision for warranty obligations 
we provide warranty coverage for most of our products  including products under long term contracts  for a period of at least one year from the date of shipment 
we record a liability for estimated warranty expense based on historical claims  product failure rates and other factors 
there exist inherent risks and uncertainties in estimating warranty expenses  particularly on larger or longer term contracts 
as such  if we do not accurately estimate our warranty costs  any changes to our original estimates could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
accounting for income taxes 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the tax jurisdictions where we operate  permanent differences between financial reporting and tax reporting and available credits and incentives 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions 
we may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by us may not be sustained 
we provide tax reserves for tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit 
the development of reserves for these exposures requires consideration of timing and judgments about tax issues and potential outcomes  and is a subjective critical estimate 
in certain circumstances  the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties 
if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates  they could have a material impact on our results of operations and our financial position 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends 
several factors may influence the sale and use of our inventories  including decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in a change in the amount of excess and obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination 
any such charges could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
generally  we will require cash in advance or payment secured by irrevocable letters of credit before an order is accepted from an international customer that we do not do business with regularly 
in addition  we seek to obtain insurance for certain international customers 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the financial health of specific customers 
changes to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of our consolidated net sales fiscal years ended july  net sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses in process research and development amortization of intangibles operating income interest expense income  net income before provision for income taxes net income comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales was driven by an increase in our telecommunications transmission and our mobile data communications segments  partially offset by lower net sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment 
net sales in our telecommunications transmission segment were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the growth in this segment resulted primarily from an increase in demand for our satellite earth station products and sales related to a contract with a third party commercial customer to outsource its manufacturing 
fiscal also includes a million cumulative adjustment to net sales which resulted from lower than anticipated costs on two large over the horizon microwave system contracts 
in late fiscal  we announced that the us department of defense dod awarded us a million contract to purchase our mbps troposcatter modem upgrade kits for use on the an trc digital troposcatter 
sales related to this us government program in fiscal are expected to offset any reduction in sales  both direct and indirect  to a north african country 
we believe that sales  both direct and indirect  to this north african country  could be lower in fiscal as we believe our north african end customer is in between major phases of a large program 
sales in the over the horizon microwave systems product line can fluctuate dramatically from period to period based on the receipt of large contracts and our performance thereon 
our telecommunications transmission segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal net sales in our mobile data communications segment were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales was due to i higher sales on the mts contract  including million of sales relating to the gross profit adjustment discussed below under gross profit  ii higher sales of battlefield command and control applications to the us military  and iii our acquisition of tolt in february which contributed million of net sales for fiscal compared to million of net sales for fiscal in the second half of fiscal  we significantly de emphasized stand alone sales of tolt s low margin turnkey employee mobility solutions to further focus its sales efforts on commercial satellite based mobile data applications 
stand alone sales of these low margin turnkey employee mobility solutions during fiscal were approximately million and such sales in fiscal are expected to be nominal 
net sales for fiscal were positively impacted by a favorable cumulative adjustment associated with the change from the usage method to the straight line method of accounting for mts prepaid service time revenue  which contributed million to net sales 
period to period sales and profitability in our mobile data communications segment can fluctuate dramatically due to funding fluctuations 
in fiscal  we began to receive orders under our mts contract for the army national guard s acquisition of mts equipment  including our mt transceiver and related services 
if we receive additional significant orders from the army national guard and if we continue to experience strong demand from the us army  we expect that sales in this segment will increase in fiscal the mts contract is not subject to automatic renewal or extension upon its scheduled expiration in july if the mts contract is not renewed  extended or if we fail to succeed in a recompete process  it would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
our mobile data communications segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal net sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in net sales was due primarily to lower sales of our amplifiers that are incorporated into improvised explosive device jamming systems  partially offset by increased demand for other defense related products in this segment 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal international sales which include sales to us companies for inclusion in products which are sold to international customers represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
domestic commercial sales represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
sales to the us government including sales to prime contractors to the us government represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
one customer  a prime contractor  represented of consolidated net sales in both fiscal and direct and indirect sales to a north african country  including certain sales to the prime contractor mentioned above  represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
our gross profit percentage was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal excluding the impact of adjustments to both net sales and gross profit in both periods  as discussed below  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal and would have been and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily due to a higher proportion of our consolidated net sales being in the mobile data communications segment  which typically realizes lower gross margins than sales in our other two segments 
in addition  fiscal includes higher sales relating to tolt s turnkey employee mobility solutions  which have lower gross margins than any of our other product lines 
the decline in gross margin percentage due to the change in product mix was partially offset by continued increased operating efficiencies associated with increased usage of our high volume technology manufacturing facility during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded favorable cumulative gross profit adjustments of million of which million relates to the mobile data communications segment and million relates to the rf microwave amplifiers segment 
the adjustment in our mobile data communications segment was primarily the result of increased mts funding from the us army  as well as improved operating efficiencies 
the adjustment in our rf microwave amplifiers segment related to a military contract that was substantially completed in fiscal these favorable adjustments were partially offset by a million warranty provision in our mobile data communications segment relating to certain of our firmware that needs to be modified 
during fiscal  we recorded cumulative adjustments related to two large over the horizon microwave system contracts and the mts contract with an aggregate impact of million on gross profit of which million relates to the mobile data communications segment and million relates to the telecommunications transmission segment 
in our mobile data communications segment  we continue to rollout our next generation satellite transceiver  known as the mt  and enhance our network and related software to provide increased speed and performance 
we continue to work closely with our customers and currently expect to continue these initiatives through fiscal if the current funding levels of mts and battlefield command and control applications are maintained or increased  or if and when we receive additional orders from the army national guard  we may experience additional increased operating efficiencies in fiscal unrelated to the next generation mts technology upgrade  we are also continuing to upgrade certain of our firmware that needs to be modified 
the ultimate amount of warranty expense could differ from our initial estimate and we may incur additional unanticipated costs or delays 
included in cost of sales for fiscal and are provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  respectively 
as discussed under critical accounting policies provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  we regularly review our inventory and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and projected usage assumptions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to i the increased level of net sales and activity in our telecommunications transmission and mobile data communications segments  ii the recording of million of stock based compensation expense during fiscal  and iii a full year of expenses associated with tolt  which was acquired in february there was no stock based compensation expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal as a percentage of consolidated net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
approximately million and million of such amounts  respectively  related to our telecommunications transmission segment  with the remaining expenses primarily related to our mobile data communications segment and  to a lesser extent  our rf microwave amplifiers segment 
in addition  during fiscal  we recorded million of stock based compensation expense in research and development expenses 
there was no stock based compensation expense included in research and development expenses in fiscal as an investment for the future  we are continually enhancing our existing products and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which is not reflected in the reported research and development expenses  but is included in net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the amortization primarily relates to intangibles with finite lives that we acquired in connection with various acquisitions 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the million  or increase  was the result of the higher sales and gross profit  discussed above  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
operating income in our telecommunications transmission segment increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  as a result of increased net sales and gross profit  partially offset by increased operating expenses 
in addition  fiscal included a million positive impact on operating income from the cumulative gross margin adjustments discussed above under gross profit related to two large over the horizon microwave system contracts 
our mobile data communications segment generated operating income of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due primarily to the significant increase in net sales and gross profit  partially offset by increased operating expenses  including increased research and development expenses 
the operations relating to tolt  which incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal  have been combined into our network operations center facility 
in fiscal  although we expect to incur lower expenses relating to our commercial satellite based mobile data applications  we do expect to increase other operating expenses  particularly research and development expenses  as we continue to position ourselves to win an extension or recompete of the mts contract that expires in july and as we develop new technologies for other programs  such as blue force tracking 
in addition  fiscal and included positive impacts on operating income from the cumulative gross margin adjustments  net of the warranty provision in the fiscal period  discussed above under gross profit of million and million  respectively 
operating income in our rf microwave amplifiers segment increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal operating income for fiscal includes a million benefit from a positive gross margin adjustment on a contract discussed above under gross profit 
unallocated operating expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to the recording of million of stock based compensation expense associated with sfas no 
r and increased incentive compensation costs in connection with the significant increase in pre tax income 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for both fiscal and interest expense primarily relates to our convertible senior notes issued in january interest income 
interest income for fiscal was million  as compared to million for fiscal the million increase was due primarily to an increase in interest rates and additional investable cash  primarily provided by our operating cash flow 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to i the increased level of pre tax profit  ii the nondeductibility of stock based compensation expense in fiscal relating to incentive stock options  iii the expiration  in december  of the federal research and experimentation credit  and iv the scheduled phase out of the extraterritorial income exclusion which was slightly offset by the scheduled phase in of the deduction for domestic production activities 
in fiscal  we recorded a net tax benefit of million primarily relating to the favorable settlement of a state tax matter 
in fiscal  we recorded a million tax benefit related to the reduction in the valuation allowance that was established for the extended write off period of acquired in process research and development 
we currently expect our effective tax rate for fiscal to approximate 
if legislation to extend the federal research and experimentation credit is not signed into law  our effective tax rate for fiscal could approximate 
in fiscal  we were informed by the internal revenue service that our federal income tax return for the fiscal year ended july  was selected for audit 
the audit is in the early stages and additional income tax returns for other fiscal years may be examined 
if the outcome of the audit differs materially from our original income tax provisions  it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales was driven by increased demand for our products in all three business segments 
net sales in our telecommunications transmission segment were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the growth in this segment resulted primarily from a significant increase in demand for our satellite earth station products and incremental sales of our over the horizon microwave systems 
in addition  favorable cumulative gross margin adjustments  resulting from lower than anticipated costs on two large over the horizon microwave system contracts  contributed million and million in net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
memotec  which we acquired in may  contributed million and million to net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
our telecommunications transmission segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal net sales in our mobile data communications segment were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales was due  in part  to increased demand and continued deployment of our mts system by the us army and higher sales of battlefield command and control applications to the us military 
tolt  which we acquired in february  contributed million of net sales for fiscal also  included in net sales for fiscal is a million cumulative adjustment associated with the aforementioned change from the usage method to the straight line method of accounting for mts prepaid service time revenue 
our mobile data communications segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal net sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the significant increase in net sales was primarily the result of increased demand for our defense related products 
in particular  we experienced a marked increase in demand for our rf microwave amplifiers that are incorporated into improvised explosive device jamming systems 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal international sales which include sales to domestic companies for inclusion in products which are sold to international customers represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
domestic commercial sales represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
sales to the us government including sales to prime contractors to the us government represented and of consolidated net sales for fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  one customer  a prime contractor  represented of consolidated net sales 
during fiscal  one customer  another prime contractor  represented of consolidated net sales 
direct and indirect sales to a north african country  including certain sales to the prime contractors mentioned above  during fiscal and represented and  respectively  of consolidated net sales 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the increase in net sales and the gross profit percentage  which increased from for fiscal to for fiscal fiscal includes favorable cumulative gross margin adjustments on two large over the horizon microwave system contracts and the mts contract including the mts prepaid service time adjustment as discussed above  which had an aggregate impact of million on gross profit compared to favorable cumulative gross margin adjustments during fiscal of million 
excluding the sales and gross profit relating to prior periods from these adjustments  our gross margin percentage still improved significantly due to increased operating efficiencies 
as mentioned above  in fiscal  we continued to realize increased operating efficiencies 
in our telecommunications transmission segment  such efficiencies were achieved  in part  by our continuing efforts to expand the usage of our high volume manufacturing facility in tempe  arizona 
the increased utilization and resulting operating efficiencies were the result of higher demand for our satellite earth station products  as well as the continued use of the facility by our other two segments for certain high volume manufacturing requirements 
in addition  as part of our strategy to leverage the high volume technology manufacturing center and further develop a diversified customer base  we produced and currently have on hand million of inventory relating to a contract from a third party commercial customer to outsource its manufacturing 
in our mobile data communications segment  operating efficiencies were the result of incremental mts and battlefield command and control applications funding from the us army 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment experienced increased operating efficiencies associated with significant operating leverage driven by the increase in sales and a more favorable product mix 
included in cost of sales for fiscal and are provisions for excess and obsolete inventory of million and million  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in expenses is primarily attributable to i the increased level of net sales in all three of our business segments  ii expenses associated with the memotec and tolt acquisitions in may and february  respectively  and iii costs of compliance with recent corporate governance regulations 
as a percentage of consolidated net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for fiscal and  respectively representing an increase of million or 
approximately million and million of such amounts  respectively  related to our telecommunications transmission segment 
as an investment for the future  we are continually enhancing our existing products and developing new products and technologies 
whenever possible  we seek customer funding for research and development to adapt our products to specialized customer requirements 
during fiscal and  customers reimbursed us million and million  respectively  which is not reflected in the reported research and development expenses  but is included in net sales with the related costs included in cost of sales 
in process research and development expense 
in connection with the purchase of certain assets and liabilities of memotec in fiscal  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of in process research and development 
there was no in process research and development expense in fiscal amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the increase was attributable to the memotec and tolt acquisitions 
operating income 
operating income for fiscal and was million and million  respectively 
the million  or  increase was the result of the higher sales and gross profit  discussed above  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
operating income in our telecommunications transmission segment increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a result of increased sales and associated operating efficiencies 
fiscal operating income included favorable cumulative gross margin adjustments on two large over the horizon microwave system contracts which aggregated million  compared to million in our mobile data communications segment generated operating income of million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal as a result of increased sales and associated operating efficiencies 
in addition  fiscal operating income included a million favorable impact of the cumulative mts contract adjustments discussed above in gross profit  compared to million in fiscal this was partially offset by increased operating costs  including expenses associated with tolt and our continued initiation of commercial marketing efforts 
operating income in our rf microwave amplifiers segment increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily as a result of the significant increase in net sales and improved operating efficiencies 
unallocated operating expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  due primarily to increased compensation expense and increased costs in connection with recent corporate governance regulations 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal interest expense primarily represents interest expense associated with our convertible senior notes issued in january interest income 
interest income for fiscal was million  as compared to million for fiscal the million increase was due primarily to a higher average cash position resulting from the proceeds received from the issuance of our convertible senior notes in january and cash provided by our operating activities  as well as an increase in interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase was the result of the significant increase in pre tax profit in fiscal the effective tax rate was and in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal provision for income taxes was offset by a tax benefit of million primarily relating to the reduction in the valuation allowance that was established for the extended write off period of acquired in process research and development 
during fiscal  it became more likely than not that the related deferred tax asset would be recoverable 
excluding the tax benefit  the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
liquidity and capital resources our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents increased to million at july  from million at july   representing an increase of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal such amount reflects net income of million  the impact of depreciation and amortization and the provisions for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves aggregating million and stock based compensation expense of million  offset by changes in working capital balances  most notably an increase in accounts receivable and inventory associated with the increase in net sales 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million  primarily representing capital expenditures including expenditures related to the continued expansion of our high volume technology manufacturing center located in tempe  arizona  as well as continued enhancements to our network operations facility in germantown  maryland 
we currently expect capital expenditures for fiscal to be between million and million 
net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million  due primarily to proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan shares aggregating million and a million excess income tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
financing arrangement on january   we issued million of our convertible senior notes in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
the net proceeds from this transaction were million after deducting the initial purchaser s discount and other transaction costs 
for further information concerning this financing  see notes to consolidated financial statements note convertible senior notes due commitments in the normal course of business  we routinely enter into binding and non binding purchase obligations primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment 
we do not expect that these commitments as of july  will materially adversely affect our liquidity 
at july   we had contractual cash obligations to repay our convertible senior notes  capital lease and operating lease obligations including satellite lease expenditures relating to our mobile data communications segment contracts and the financing of a purchase of proprietary technology 
payments due under these long term obligations  excluding interest on the convertible senior notes  are as follows obligations due by fiscal years total and and after maturity of our convertible senior notes   operating lease commitments     other obligations    total contractual cash obligations    as further discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements note convertible senior notes due  we may  at our option  redeem some or all of the notes on or after february  holders of our convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding notes on february   february  and february  and upon certain events 
we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements with financial institutions relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts 
at july   the balance of these agreements was million 
cash we have pledged against such agreements aggregating million has been classified as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in the event that we identify a significant acquisition that requires additional cash  we would seek to borrow funds or raise additional equity capital 
legal proceedings we are subject to certain legal actions  which arise in the normal course of business 
although the ultimate outcome of litigation is difficult to accurately predict  we believe that the outcome of these actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
during fiscal  two of our leased facilities located in florida experienced hurricane damage to both leasehold improvements and personal property 
as of july   we have completed all restoration efforts relating to the hurricane damage and have recorded an million insurance recovery receivable and accrued a total of million for hurricane related costs 
despite a written agreement with the general contractor that we believe limits our liability for the cost of the repairs to the amount of insurance proceeds ultimately received from our insurance company  a dispute has arisen with the general contractor and a certain subcontractor over the subcontractor s demand for payment directly from us by virtue of a purported assignment of rights and other grounds in an amount exceeding the insurance proceeds by million  plus late charges  interest  fees  costs and certain treble damages 
as a result of this dispute  we deposited approximately million  representing the balance of the insurance proceeds received  in our attorneys trust account and filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the th judicial circuit court for orange county  florida

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law and prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
fin prescribes a two step evaluation process for tax positions 
the first step is recognition based on a determination of whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal the cumulative effects  if any  of applying fin will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
we have commenced the process of evaluating the potential effects of fin on our consolidated financial statements and are not yet in a position to determine what  if any  effects fin will have on our consolidated financial statements
