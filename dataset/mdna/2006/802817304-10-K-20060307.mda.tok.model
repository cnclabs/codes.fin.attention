item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with selected financial data and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring  developing and commercializing proprietary products that treat gastrointestinal diseases and disorders and enhance the quality of life for patients 
the primary focus of our current efforts is the development and commercialization of next generation proton pump inhibitor  or ppi  products the most frequently prescribed drugs for the treatment of many upper gastrointestinal  or gi  diseases and disorders 
our zegerid products are the first immediate release oral ppis to be developed for the us market 
the formulations are based on patented technology and utilize antacids to protect the omeprazole from acid degradation in the stomach  allowing the omeprazole to be quickly absorbed into the bloodstream 
although other marketed oral ppis enjoy widespread use due to their potent acid suppression  favorable safety profile and once a day dosing  they are available only in delayed release  enteric coated formulations 
while the enteric coating protects the ppi from acid degradation  it also delays absorption until the ppi reaches the less acidic small intestine 
our immediate release zegerid products do not have enteric coatings and are designed to be absorbed rapidly  while providing a duration of effect similar to delayed release ppis 
we received approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  to market zegerid capsules in february for the treatment of heartburn and other symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease  or gerd  treatment and maintenance of healing of erosive esophagitis and treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers 
we received approval from the fda to market zegerid powder for oral suspension for these same indications in in addition  zegerid powder for oral suspension is approved for the reduction of risk of upper gi bleeding in critically ill patients  and is currently the only ppi product approved for this indication 
we plan to commercially launch zegerid capsules in march or april through our greater than member commercial organization  which includes approximately field sales representatives  who are currently promoting zegerid powder for oral suspension 
our sales representatives have an average of five years of pharmaceutical sales experience  with many also having prior ppi selling experience 
to support our sales and marketing efforts  we entered into a co promotion agreement with otsuka america pharmaceutical  inc  or otsuka america  under which otsuka america s approximately field sales representatives are co promoting zegerid powder for oral suspension and will also co promote zegerid capsules to our targeted physicians 

table of contents we were formed in december and commenced significant business activities in late from to  we entered into various license agreements with universities and non profit institutions for patented technology rights for the development of products utilizing azathioprine or cytoprotective compounds in the treatment of lower and upper gi diseases 
we evaluated these compounds in preclinical and clinical trials  as appropriate  and in shifted our focus to the immediate release ppi technology that represents our current efforts 
we terminated our development programs regarding the azathioprine compound and  in  we terminated the cytoprotective compound license agreements that we had entered into in prior years 
in january  we entered into an exclusive  worldwide license agreement with the university of missouri  under which we licensed rights to all of its patents and patent applications relating to specific formulations of immediate release ppis with antacids for treating upper gi diseases and disorders 
this licensed technology forms the basis of our zegerid family of products 
we paid the university of missouri an upfront licensing fee of million in and a one time million milestone fee upon the filing of our first nda in in july  we paid a one time million milestone fee based upon the fda s approval of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg  and we are required to make additional milestone payments to the university of missouri upon the achievement of certain regulatory events related to obtaining approvals outside the us  which may total up to million in the aggregate 
we are required to make milestone payments  up to a maximum of million  based on first time achievement of significant sales thresholds  and to pay royalties on net sales of our products 
we are also required to pay the university of missouri a portion on any sublicense fees  milestone payments or royalties that we receive from any sublicense 
in june  under a strategic sublicense agreement  we granted tap pharmaceutical products inc  or tap  the north american rights to develop  manufacture and sell products resulting from the use of our immediate release ppi technology with lansoprazole and derivatives of lansoprazole 
we received an upfront fee of million in july and a million milestone payment in february related to tap s development activities 
we received the february milestone after we prevailed in an alternative dispute resolution proceeding in which we alleged that tap had achieved a development milestone 
we paid of the upfront fee and the february milestone to the university of missouri 
in january  we received notice from tap that tap is exercising its right to terminate the sublicense agreement effective march  we have a non exclusive agreement with otsuka america  under which otsuka america is co promoting zegerid powder for oral suspension and will co promote zegerid capsules to targeted us physicians 
we originally entered into the agreement in october and amended the terms of the agreement in january under the agreement  we received a million upfront payment from otsuka america  and have agreed to pay otsuka america a royalty on total us net sales of zegerid powder for oral suspension and zegerid capsules 
the agreement will terminate automatically on december   unless terminated sooner 
in addition to other more limited termination rights  either party may terminate the agreement at any time following june   by providing at least days prior written notice 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  these losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with license fees  research and development activities  including costs of clinical trial activities associated with our current products  commercialization activities and general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur additional operating losses and capital expenditures as we support the commercial launch of zegerid capsules and our commercial organization  enhance our product portfolio through internal development  product and patent licensing or strategic acquisitions and fund our administrative support activities 
on april   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share  raising net proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and offering costs 
on april   in connection with the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option  we completed the sale of  additional shares of common stock at the initial public offering price of per share  raising net proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and offering costs 

table of contents on july   we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share  raising net proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and offering costs 
the completed offering included the full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
on may   we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s covering equity or debt securities with the securities and exchange commission  which was declared effective on june  on august   we completed an offering of  shares of common stock registered under the universal shelf registration statement at a price of per share  raising net proceeds of approximately million  net of placement agents fees and offering costs 
in february  we entered into a committed equity financing facility  or ceff  with kingsbridge capital limited  or kingsbridge  which may entitle us to sell and obligate kingsbridge to purchase  from time to time over a period of three years  shares of our common stock for cash consideration up to the lesser of million or  shares  subject to certain conditions and restrictions 
in connection with the ceff  we entered into a common stock purchase agreement and registration rights agreement  and we also issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the warrant is fully exercisable beginning after the six month anniversary of the agreement for a period of five years thereafter 
on february   we filed a resale shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission to facilitate kingsbridge s public resale of shares of our common stock which it may acquire from us from time to time in connection with our draw downs under the ceff or upon the exercise of a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock that we issued to kingsbridge in connection with the ceff 
the resale shelf registration statement was declared effective on february  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our financial statements included in this form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition product sales  net 
we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when title has passed  the price is fixed or determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting the resulting receivable 
we recognize product sales net of estimated allowances for product returns  managed care rebates  reimbursements relating to medicaid  patient coupons  chargebacks from distributors  wholesaler fees and prompt payment and other discounts 
such estimates require our most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual future payments for returns  rebates  coupons  chargebacks and discounts exceed the estimates we made at the time of sale  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
we are obligated to accept from customers the return of products that are within six months of their expiration date or months beyond their expiration date 
we authorize returns for damaged products and exchanges for expired products in accordance with our return goods policy and procedures  and have established allowances for such amounts at the time of sale 
we commercially launched zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in october and zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in february  and through december   
table of contents we have had product returns of approximately  given our limited history  we have established our allowances for potential product returns based on an analysis of product shipments to our wholesale distributors in excess of prescription demand for zegerid powder for oral suspension 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable as of the date when made  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may be materially and negatively impacted if actual returns exceed our estimated allowance for returns 
sublicense and co promotion revenue 
we recognize sublicense and co promotion revenue consistent with the provisions of the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines in the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payments and customer acceptance 
we analyze each element of our sublicense and co promotion agreements  to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on upfront payments over the term of the related agreements unless the fee is in exchange for products delivered or services rendered that represent the culmination of a separate earnings process and no further performance obligation exists under the contract 
we evaluate the criteria outlined in emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of sublicense revenues and related costs or the net amount earned under the arrangement 
we have recognized the gross amount of sublicense revenue and related costs as we have no future obligations pursuant to the arrangement  we are the primary obligor in the arrangement  we had latitude in establishing the amounts received under the arrangement and we were involved in the determination of the scope of technology sublicensed under the agreement 
inventories and related reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost fifo or market and consist of finished goods and raw materials used in the manufacture of our zegerid powder for oral suspension product 
we provide reserves for potentially excess  dated or obsolete inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand and on firm purchase commitments and inventory in the distribution channel  compared to forecasts of future sales 
clinical trial expenses research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
if timelines or contracts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed  we modify our estimates accordingly on a prospective basis 
stock based compensation as allowed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
 and  accordingly  do not recognize compensation expense for stock option grants made at an exercise price equal to or in excess of the estimated fair value of the stock at the date of grant 
deferred compensation is recognized and amortized on an accelerated basis in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  over the vesting period of the related options 

table of contents we account for options issued to non employees under sfas no 
and eitf issue  accounting for equity investments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
as such  the value of such options is periodically remeasured and income or expense is recognized during their vesting terms 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we had million as of december  and million as of december  in gross deferred tax assets  which were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
please see our audited financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and product sales  net 
product sales  net were million for and consisted of sales of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg  which we commercially launched in the us in october  and sales of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg  which we commercially launched in the us in february product sales  net were  for and consisted of sales of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg 
there were no revenues from product sales in sublicense and co promotion revenue 
sublicense and co promotion revenue was million for and  for there were no sublicense and co promotion revenues in sublicense and co promotion revenue consisted of co promotion revenue from the million upfront fee received pursuant to our co promotion agreement with otsuka america entered into in october  which is being amortized to revenue over the term of the agreement through december  additionally  in  sublicense and co promotion revenue consisted of the million milestone payment we received from tap in february related to tap s development activities 
we received the february milestone payment after we prevailed in an alternative dispute resolution proceeding in which we alleged that tap had achieved a development milestone 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was million for and million for  or approximately and of net product sales  respectively 
there was no cost of sales in cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials  third party manufacturing costs  freight and indirect personnel and other overhead costs associated with the sales of zegerid powder for oral suspension 
cost of sales also includes reserves for excess  dated or obsolete commercial inventories based on an analysis of inventory on hand and on firm purchase commitments and inventory in the distribution channel  compared to forecasts of future sales 
based upon review of initial prescription trends for zegerid powder for oral suspension mg subsequent to its commercial launch in october  and in light of our receipt of fda approval to market zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in december  commercial inventory reserves of approximately million were recorded in cost of sales in license fees and royalties 
license fees and royalties were million for  million for and million for license fees and royalties consisted of royalties due to the university of missouri and otsuka america based upon net product sales in and additionally  in  license fees and royalties included million paid to the university of missouri  which represented of the milestone fee received pursuant to our 
table of contents strategic sublicense agreement with tap  and in  license fees and royalties included the one time million milestone fee paid to the university of missouri based upon the fda s approval of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg 
license fees and royalties in consisted of our million milestone fee paid to the university of missouri upon the filing of our first nda 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million for  million for and million for research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with clinical trials of our products under development as well as clinical studies designed to further differentiate our products from those of our competitors or to obtain additional labeling indications  costs of developing and manufacturing our products under development  compensation and other expenses related to research and development personnel and facilities expenses 
the million decrease in our research and development expenses from to was primarily attributable to spending in associated with our clinical trial to evaluate the safety of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg  our clinical trial evaluating zegerid powder for oral suspension as compared to protonix delayed release pantoprazole capsules for control of nocturnal gastric acidity  our pivotal pk pd clinical trials evaluating zegerid capsules and zegerid chewable tablets and the user fee associated with the submission of our nda for zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in february there were no costs associated with these activities in additionally  a decrease in costs associated with preparation for commercial manufacturing of zegerid powder for oral suspension and the formulation development and production of clinical trial materials for zegerid capsules and zegerid chewable tablets contributed to the decrease in our research and development expenses 
the million increase in our research and development expenses from to was primarily attributable to increased costs associated with preparation for commercial manufacturing of zegerid powder for oral suspension  the formulation development and production of clinical trial materials for zegerid capsules and zegerid chewable tablets  and the hiring of additional personnel 
the increase was also attributable to the initiation and completion of pivotal pk pd clinical trials evaluating zegerid capsules  initiation of pivotal pk pd clinical trials evaluating zegerid chewable tablets  spending associated with our phase iiib clinical trial evaluating zegerid powder for oral suspension as compared to protonix delayed release pantoprazole capsules for control of nocturnal gastric acidity and payment of the user fee associated with the submission of our nda for zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in february these increases in our research and development expenses were offset in part by decreased clinical trial costs associated with our pivotal phase iii clinical trial evaluating zegerid powder for oral suspension mg for the reduction of risk of upper gi bleeding in critically ill patients that was completed in june and completion of our clinical trial to evaluate the safety of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg which was initiated in october expenses related to clinical trials pursuant to contracts with research institutions and clinical research organizations represented of our research and development expenses in  of our research and development expenses in and of our research and development expenses in accrued clinical trial expenses are based on estimates of the work completed under the contracts  milestones achieved and level of patient enrollment 
actual services performed  number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates  resulting in adjustments to clinical trial expenses in future periods 
in the past  we have not experienced any material deviations between accrued clinical trial expenses and actual clinical trial expenses  and management does not anticipate material deviations in the future 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on the development of our zegerid family of products  which are immediate release formulations of the ppi omeprazole  in powder for oral suspension  capsule and chewable tablet dosage forms 
we completed a pivotal pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic  or pk pd  clinical trial for zegerid powder for oral suspension mg in  submitted an nda to the fda in and received fda approval in june we also completed a pivotal pk pd clinical trial in  as well as a pivotal phase iii clinical trial in critically ill patients in  for zegerid powder for oral suspension mg  submitted an nda to the fda in february and received fda approval in december we conducted an open label clinical trial to evaluate the safety of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg as additional support for the fda approval 
during  we also conducted a clinical trial evaluating zegerid powder for oral suspension as compared to protonix delayed release pantoprazole capsules for control of nocturnal gastric acidity 
in november  we completed two pivotal pk pd clinical trials evaluating zegerid capsules  submitted an nda to the fda in april and received fda approval in february in february  we completed two pivotal pk pd clinical 
table of contents trials evaluating zegerid chewable tablets and in may  we submitted our nda to the fda seeking approval to market this product 
from the time that we entered into our license agreement with the university of missouri in january through december   our costs associated with the research and development of the zegerid products have represented over of our research and development expenses for all program areas 
in addition  during the year ended december   costs associated with the research and development of the zegerid products represented over of our research and development expenses for all program areas 
in the future  we may conduct additional clinical trials to further differentiate our zegerid family of products  in addition to completing development of zegerid chewable tablets 
we have also committed  in connection with the approval of our ndas for zegerid powder for oral suspension  to evaluate the product in pediatric populations  including pk pd and safety studies 
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our zegerid family of products 
although we are currently focused primarily on advancing our zegerid family of products  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical merits of each project 
product development timelines and costs may vary significantly for each of our zegerid products and are difficult to estimate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations  requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
although we received fda approval to market zegerid capsules and zegerid powder for oral suspension  we cannot be certain when or if we will realize any profits from these products or any of our other development projects 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for  million for and million for the million increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily attributable to the recording of a full year s costs related to our sales and marketing personnel  including our field sales organization hired in the second half of additionally  outside services and professional fees associated with our commercial activities increased in  including advertising and promotion and initiation of our speaker programs 
the million increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses from to was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel  including our field sales organization in the second half of additionally  outside services and professional fees associated with the commercial launch of our first product  zegerid powder for oral suspension mg  increased in  including advertising and promotion  holding our first national sales meeting  medical education and the cost of product samples 
stock based compensation 
we recorded non cash compensation charges of million in  million in and million in in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  we recorded deferred compensation of  in  million in and million in we recorded this amount as a component of stockholders equity and will amortize the amount as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the options 
the compensation charges in related to research and development personnel in the amount of  and selling  general and administrative personnel in the amount of million 
the compensation charges in related to research and development personnel in the amount of million and selling  general and administrative personnel in the amount of million 
the compensation charges in related to research and development personnel in the amount of  and selling  general and administrative personnel in the amount of million 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was million in  million in and  in the million increase from to was primarily attributable to interest income awarded to us in connection with the million milestone we received from tap after we prevailed in an alternative dispute resolution proceeding and higher interest income resulting from a higher rate of return on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the  increase from to was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income resulting from higher cash balances from our initial public offering of common stock in april and follow on public offering of common stock in july 
table of contents income taxes 
we have incurred net operating losses since inception and  consequently  have not recorded any federal or state income tax benefit 
our deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax asset  as the realization of the deferred tax asset is uncertain 
as of december   we had federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
these federal and state tax loss carryforwards are available to reduce future taxable income 
if not utilized  the net operating loss carryforwards will begin expiring in for federal purposes and for state purposes 
annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carryforwards before they are used 
under the provisions of the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million  compared to million as of december   a decrease of million 
this decrease resulted primarily from our net loss for offset in part by the net proceeds of approximately million we received in august upon completion of our registered direct offering of  shares of common stock 
net cash used in operating activities was million for  million for and million for the primary use of cash was to fund our net losses for these periods  adjusted for non cash expenses  including  for   for and  for in depreciation and amortization  million for  million for and million for in stock based compensation  and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
working capital uses of cash in included decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  allowance for product returns and deferred revenue 
working capital sources of cash in included increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to increased spending levels associated with the commercial launch of zegerid powder for oral suspension mg and increased accrued compensation and benefits associated with our increase in personnel 
additionally  working capital sources of cash in included our establishment of an allowance for product returns and an increase in deferred revenue related to the million upfront payment we received from otsuka america in october  which is being amortized over the term of the agreement 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for  and net cash used in investing activities was million for and million for these activities primarily consisted of purchases and sales and maturities of short term investments 
additionally  in  long term restricted cash increased in connection with establishing a letter of credit under our vehicle lease agreements  and in  we made deposits of approximately million on certain manufacturing equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for  million for and million for these activities consisted primarily of the issuance of common stock in our registered direct offering in  initial public offering and our follow on public offering in and private sales of preferred stock in additionally  net cash provided by financing activities included proceeds received from the exercise of stock options in  and and through the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan in and while we support the commercialization of zegerid capsules and as we continue to sponsor clinical trials for  seek regulatory approvals of  and develop and manufacture our current products and new product opportunities  we anticipate significant cash requirements for personnel costs  advertising and promotional activities  capital expenditures and investment in additional office space  internal systems and infrastructure 
we currently rely on osg norwich pharmaceuticals  inc as our manufacturer of zegerid capsules and patheon  inc as our manufacturer of zegerid powder for oral suspension 
we also purchase commercial quantities of the active ingredient from our omeprazole supplier 
at december   we had finished goods and raw materials inventory purchase commitments of approximately million 

table of contents the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than one to four to contractual obligations total one year three years five years thereafter in thousands operating leases equipment financing sponsored research agreements other long term contractual obligations total in november  we entered into a master lease agreement giving us the ability to lease vehicles under operating leases 
in connection with accepting delivery of vehicles and entering into lease obligations in january  we established a letter of credit for million naming the lessor as beneficiary 
the letter of credit is fully secured by restricted cash and has automatic annual extensions 
each lease schedule has an initial term of months from the date of delivery with successive month renewal terms 
we intend to lease each vehicle  on average  approximately months 
we guarantee a certain residual value at the lease termination date 
as of december   we do not believe we will incur any significant losses associated with this guaranty 
the amount and timing of cash requirements will depend on market acceptance of zegerid powder for oral suspension  zegerid capsules and any other products that may receive regulatory approval  the resources we devote to researching  developing  formulating  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our products  and our ability to enter into third party collaborations 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments together with potential proceeds from the ceff with kingsbridge will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months  however  our projected revenue may decrease or our expenses may increase and that would lead to our cash resources being consumed before that time 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities 
we may finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
we likely will pursue raising additional funds during to support the further commercialization of our zegerid products 
in may  we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission  which was declared effective in june on august   we sold  shares of our common stock that were registered under the universal shelf registration statement 
the universal shelf registration statement may permit us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to an additional approximately million of equity or debt securities 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such offerings of securities 
factors influencing the availability of additional financing include the progress of our commercial activities  investor perception of our prospects and the general condition of the financial markets  among others 
in february  we entered into the ceff which may entitle us to sell and obligate kingsbridge to purchase  from time to time over a period of three years  shares of our common stock for cash consideration up to the lesser of million or  shares  subject to certain conditions and restrictions 
we filed a resale shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission to facilitate kingsbridge s public resale of shares of our common stock which it may acquire from us from time to time in connection with our draw downs under the ceff or upon the exercise of a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock that we issued to kingsbridge in connection with the ceff 
the resale shelf registration statement was declared effective in february there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any draw downs under the ceff 
factors influencing our ability to complete draw downs include conditions such as a minimum price for our common stock  the accuracy of representations and warranties made to kingsbridge  the continued effectiveness of the shelf registration statement  and the continued listing of our stock on the nasdaq national market 
we cannot be certain that our existing cash and marketable securities resources  including under the ceff  will be adequate  and failure to obtain adequate financing may adversely affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern 
we also cannot be certain that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
for example  we may not be successful in obtaining collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or 
table of contents royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through collaboration  licensing or other similar arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our products or proprietary technologies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders ownership will be diluted 
any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations 
if adequate funds are not available on terms acceptable to us at that time  our ability to achieve profitability or to respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited  and we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our product and clinical development programs or delay the launch of our future products 
as of december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board  or fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r supersedes apb no 
and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  we are required to adopt this new standard in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending march  sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements for sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but also permits companies to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no

 through the end of  we accounted for share based payments to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options when the exercise price was equal to or in excess of the fair value of the stock at the date of grant 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share in note to the financial statements 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed 
table of contents interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   we did not have any holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments  or any foreign currency denominated transactions  and all of our cash and cash equivalents were in money market funds and other highly liquid investments
