item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cytyc corporation is a diversified women s health company that designs  develops  manufactures  and markets innovative and clinically effective products 
our products cover a range of women s health applications  including cervical cancer screening  treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding  radiation treatment of early stage breast cancer and breast cancer risk assessment 
we operate our business in three segments domestic diagnostic products  domestic surgical products and international 
our domestic diagnostics products segment develops and markets the thinprep system in the united states primarily for use in cytology testing applications focused on women s health  such as cervical cancer screening 
our domestic surgical products segment manufactures the novasure system  an innovative endometrial ablation device to treat menorrhagia  or excessive menstrual bleeding  the mammosite radiation therapy system  a device for the treatment of breast cancer that positions radiation sources directly into the post lumpectomy site to optimize radiation treatment delivery while minimizing damage to healthy tissue  and the gliasite radiation therapy system for the treatment of malignant brain tumors 
the domestic surgical products segment markets these products in the united states 
our international segment markets our diagnostic and surgical products outside of the united states through our subsidiaries and distributors in locations such as canada  europe  australia and hong kong 
net sales have grown in all of our segments during the last three years through product diversification within the women s health market 
net sales in fiscal year were million  an increase of from the prior year 
net income in fiscal year was million  an increase of from the prior year 
net income per diluted share was in fiscal year compared to in the prior year 
our strategy is to yield sustainable growth through diversification of our revenue streams 
the growth in sales of our novasure system resulted from increased market penetration  as well as sales generated by the mammosite and gliasite systems acquired during the year 
the growth in our domestic diagnostic sales primarily reflects the growing adoption of the thinprep imaging system  which was commercially released in june and which continues to strengthen and grow our thinprep system product line 
we are also making investments in the enhancement of our current product offerings  as well as emerging technologies in such fields as cervical cancer and breast cancer diagnosis and treatment 
we are making major investments in sales and marketing  including integration efforts following the proxima acquisition in march  to better support our customers and help expand market demand  as well as to increase our market share 
the investment in our future is supported by our continued strong cash flow generated from operations of million  million and million during fiscal years  and  respectively  and our million in cash  cash equivalents and investment securities as of december  we will continue to utilize our positive cash flow from operations to invest in our existing business operations as well as to make certain strategic acquisitions or investments 
we remain committed to our goal to become the market leader in providing innovative technologies that improve women s health 
the strength of our existing capabilities in the field of obstetrics and gynecology  along with our entrance in the field of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment  including the size of our dedicated sales team  our clinically driven marketing approach  and our training to date of thousands of medical professionals  provide the foundation for our growth 
we are confident in our ability to drive long term shareholder value using the principles of our mission  our strong product offerings  and continued commitment to expansion of our existing product offerings 
understanding our financial information our financial information is summarized in this management s discussion and analysis  the consolidated financial statements  and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements as of december  and and for each of the three fiscal years ended december    and the following will assist you in fully understanding our financial information 
organization of financial information management s discussion and analysis provides material historical and prospective disclosures enabling investors and other users to assess our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the consolidated financial statements  excluding the related notes  include the consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of income  consolidated statements of stockholders equity and consolidated statements of cash flows 
the notes  which are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements  provide additional information required to fully understand the nature of amounts included in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
a critical accounting estimate is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we continuously evaluate our critical accounting estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
valuation of long lived assets  intangibles and goodwill 
tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination  including acquired in process research and development  are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the fair values of acquired assets are determined by management using relevant information and assumptions and assisted  in certain situations  by independent appraisers 
fair value of acquired intangible assets is generally calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate  which requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates  analyses of project accomplishments  assessment of overall contributions  project risks and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
amortization of all our intangibles with defined lives  including those acquired individually  is calculated either using the straight line or cash flow method 
the cash flow method requires management s estimate of net cash flows over the life of the intangible asset  reflecting the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are expected to be consumed 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and at least annually in the case of goodwill 
if it is determined that the carrying value of long lived assets  intangibles or goodwill might not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method if the undiscounted cash flows did not exceed the carrying value of such assets 
no such impairment charges have been recorded to date 
we are required to perform an impairment review for goodwill on an annual basis  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
based on our impairment review during  the carrying amount of goodwill did not exceed its fair value and  accordingly  no impairment loss exists 
at december   we had million of net intangible assets  of which million represented goodwill 
an impairment of our intangible assets could result in a material  non cash expense in our consolidated statement of income 
property and equipment is depreciated over the useful lives of the assets 
included in property and equipment is equipment under customer usage agreements for example  a thinprep processor or a thinprep imaging system  where we install the equipment at customer sites under an agreement whereby customers commit to purchasing minimum quantities of disposable supplies from us over a defined contract term 
under these arrangements  the equipment remains our property and we have the right to either remove the equipment or increase the price per disposable supply if the customer does not consume at least the number of disposable supplies committed in the contract 
the cost of the equipment is depreciated as cost of sales over its estimated useful life 
any change in conditions that would cause us to change our estimate as to the useful lives of a group 
table of contents or class of assets included in property and equipment may significantly increase or decrease our depreciation expense on a prospective basis 
in january  we revised our estimate of the useful lives of our equipment under customer usage agreements from the specific contract terms which are generally between three to five years to a range of three to eight years  depending on the nature of the equipment under the usage agreement 
this change in estimate was based on our assessment of historical usage patterns and the useful lives of similar devices 
this change in estimate has been reflected in our operating results beginning on january  net income would have been approximately million lower in had this change in estimate not occurred 
income taxes and deferred taxes 
we file income tax returns in eleven countries as well as many states and other localities 
we must estimate our income tax expense after considering  among other factors  differing tax rates between jurisdictions  allocation factors  tax credits  non deductible items and changes in enacted tax rates 
a change in our effective income tax rate would have the effect of changing net income by approximately million or per diluted share 
deferred taxes arise because of the different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting  known as temporary differences 
we record the tax effect of these temporary differences as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred tax assets generally result in tax deductions or credits subsequent to the period in which the related item was recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
deferred tax liabilities typically reflect a current tax deduction for which the related item has not yet been recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the carrying value of our deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions  to fully recover the net carrying value of the assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of income 
when we acquired proxima in march  we recorded a net deferred tax liability of million 
this balance primarily is comprised of million of deferred tax assets  net of a million valuation allowance relating to acquired net operating losses and tax credits  offset by deferred tax liabilities of million relating to patents and developed technology 
when we acquired novacept in march  we recorded a net deferred tax asset of million 
this balance primarily is comprised of million of deferred tax assets  net of a million valuation allowance relating to acquired net operating losses and tax credits offset by deferred tax liabilities of million relating to patents and developed technology 
if we are unable to realize the benefits of these net operating losses  tax credits and other tax assets in future years  we may be required to record additional tax expense in our consolidated statement of income 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we are currently undergoing various audits on both the federal and state levels 
we expect the majority of these audits to conclude at various dates throughout although we believe we have adequate reserves for potential assessments  we recognize liabilities for potential tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and to the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we will reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary or  if the reversal relates to deferred tax assets recorded in connection with the acquisitions  we would adjust the carrying value of goodwill 
legal proceedings 
we are involved in various legal actions  the outcomes of which are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some actions  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  would require significant expenditures 
we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we review these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjust the loss provision when appropriate 
if the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated  a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a 
table of contents pre tax charge in the amount of million  which is in addition to the million we had previously recorded  in connection with an arbitration panel s decision regarding the deka products limited partnership proceeding against cytyc 
our significant legal proceedings are discussed in note e to our consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings of this form k 
stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january   as required  and we will continue to evaluate the impact of such adoption on our financial position and results of operations 
as a result of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
r  we expect stock based compensation expense in fiscal year to reduce our diluted net income per common share by approximately to 
however  our estimate will be affected by the future market price of our common stock  as well as the actual results of certain assumptions we used to value the equity awards  including the related tax impact 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our common stock during fiscal year and the number of stock options to be issued  forfeited and exercised by employees 
in order to value our equity awards  we have used the black scholes option pricing model and we will recognize stock based compensation expense for future grants on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to january   we accounted for stock options using the intrinsic value method  pursuant to the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under this method  stock based compensation expense was measured as the difference between the option s exercise price and the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
historically  under this method  stock based compensation has not been material because we grant stock options at the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with little need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

results of operations net sales years ended december  percent change in millions domestic diagnostic products domestic surgical products international total company our fiscal year operating results include the results of novacept from the date of acquisition march  
our fiscal year operating results include the results of proxima from the date of acquisition march  
the international segment includes international sales of our diagnostic products of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
this segment also includes international sales of our surgical products of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
international surgical product sales in fiscal year were not significant 

table of contents net sales for each segment as a percentage of total consolidated net sales is as follows dollars in millions logo our domestic diagnostic products sales increased in as compared to and in as compared to  due primarily to increased adoption and utilization of the thinprep imaging system commercially released in june across our customer base 
thinprep pap test sales to our largest customer  quest diagnostics  inc  represented  and of our consolidated net sales in fiscal years  and  respectively 
this decrease is primarily due to increased unit sales of the thinprep pap test and our other products to new customers and other existing customers  which thereby are representing a greater percentage of our consolidated net sales 
no individual lab is expected to represent more than of our consolidated net sales in subsequent to the expiration of our agreement with quest diagnostics  inc during the second quarter of fiscal year  we implemented an arrangement that includes terms to supply both instrumentation and disposables of the thinprep system to meet their customers demand 
net sales of our domestic surgical products segment increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of an increase in unit sales and increased pricing of the novasure single use disposable devices  as well as sales of the mammosite radiation therapy single use disposable devices 
domestic sales of our novasure system represented and of domestic surgical products segment net sales in and  respectively  and sales of the mammosite system represented of domestic surgical products segment net sales in our fiscal year operating results include the results of proxima from the date of acquisition march  
our fiscal year operating results include the results of novacept from the date of acquisition march  
net sales in our international segment  which is comprised of sales to customers outside the united states of both diagnostic and surgical products  increased in as compared to and in as compared to the increase in each year primarily reflects higher unit sales of the thinprep pap test and the novasure single use disposable devices and  to a lesser degree  an increase in average pricing 
gross margin our gross margin was for fiscal years and and was in fiscal year the gross margin remained consistent in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  as the impact of domestic net sales of the thinprep pap test and increasing sales of the higher margin novasure and mammosite disposable devices were offset by increased placements of the thinprep imaging system and growth in international sales of our diagnostic products  both of which generally have lower profit margins 
the decrease in gross margin in fiscal 
table of contents year as compared to fiscal year primarily resulted from expenses related to increased placement of the thinprep imaging system  as well as the increase in international sales of our diagnostic products  which as noted above  generally have lower profit margins as compared to domestic sales of the thinprep pap test 
operating expenses total operating expenses increased to million for fiscal year  an increase of over fiscal year  as compared to an increase of in fiscal year over fiscal year operating expenses in include a million charge recorded during the first quarter of fiscal year as a result of an arbitration decision see note e to our consolidated financial statements and part i  item legal proceedings in this form k and our operating expenses in include a charge of million to write off acquired in process research and development costs related to our acquisition of novacept in march the following is a summary of operating expenses for the years ended december   and years ended december  percent of net sales in millions research and development in process research and development sales and marketing general and administrative arbitration decision total operating expenses research and development our core research and development strategy is to enhance our existing product lines  such as the thinprep imaging system  the novasure system and the mammosite radiation therapy system  through operational enhancements and cost reductions  as well as to continue to develop additional innovative medical diagnostic and surgical devices and therapeutic applications for women s health 
our research and development costs increased to million in fiscal year  an increase of million or  over fiscal year  as compared to an increase of million or in fiscal year over fiscal year  primarily reflecting million of incremental non cash amortization of our developed technology intangible assets  specifically resulting from our acquisitions of novacept in march and proxima in march  incremental expenses supporting the mammosite radiation therapy system  our efforts to continue to improve the novasure system and the mammosite radiation therapy system by augmenting our medical development team  and increasing clinical trial costs in support of the firstcyte breast test 
we expect the non cash amortization of our existing developed technology portfolio to increase by million  to million of our research and development expense  in fiscal year the increase in research and development costs to million in fiscal year  primarily reflected our efforts to continue to improve the thinprep imaging system and the addition of development efforts related to the second generation rf controller and other operational enhancements to the novasure system at our surgical products business  as well as million in non cash amortization of the developed technology intangible asset that resulted from our acquisition of novacept 
in process research and development as part of the allocation of the purchase price of novacept in march  all intangible assets were identified and valued 
it was determined that certain developed and in development technology had value 
as a result of this identification and valuation process  we allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development projects in this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to incomplete research and development activities associated with an upgrade to the rf controller 
the rf controller delivers radio frequency energy and is one of the two primary components of the novasure system 
the upgrade to the rf controller was necessary to replace the existing power supply  a critical component of the rf controller which was being discontinued by its supplier 

table of contents the rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value was based on estimated weighted average cost of capital calculations 
a discount rate of was used to value the in process research and development project 
this discount rate was higher than our weighted average cost of capital due to the early stage life cycle of the acquired products  the inherent uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the upgrade project and successful commercialization and development of the acquired assets  the useful life of the acquired technology  the profitability levels of such technology and the uncertainty of technological advances that were unknown at that time 
as of the date of acquisition march   the upgrade to the rf controller was under design review  the remaining costs to complete the project were not material and the project was anticipated to be  and actually was  completed in late with net cash inflows commencing at that time 
accordingly  the acquired in process research and development was charged to expense as of the date of the acquisition 
there have been no variations from our underlying projections and assumptions as compared to actual operating results that would have had a material impact on the valuation of the in process research and development 
in addition  since that time  there have been no additional significant  ongoing activities associated with the in process research and development and there were no other significant acquired projects 
there were no in process research and development charges in connection with our acquisition of proxima in march sales and marketing sales and marketing costs increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of over fiscal year  as compared to a increase in fiscal year over fiscal year  primarily due to sales and marketing costs at our domestic surgical products business 
the increase of approximately million in fiscal year reflects the expansion of our domestic sales force resulting from the acquisitions of novacept and proxima in march and  respectively  costs to integrate and cross train our sales forces following the proxima acquisition and costs associated with a direct to consumer marketing program launched during for our novasure product 
in addition  we incurred incremental sales and marketing costs of approximately million in as compared to to support our international expansion efforts 
the increase in fiscal year as compared to was primarily due to sales and marketing costs of approximately million at our surgical products business  including costs following the march acquisition of novacept to integrate and cross train our domestic diagnostic products and domestic surgical products sales forces 
in addition  we incurred incremental sales and marketing costs in as compared to to support our international expansion efforts  including efforts following the recommendation of liquid based cytology as the primary means to process samples for cervical cancer screening programs by the united kingdom s national institute for clinical excellence in october  as well as higher selling and customer training costs associated with supporting the continued market release of the thinprep imaging system 
overall  our sales and marketing expense remained of net sales in fiscal years  and general and administrative general and administrative costs increased to million for the year ended december   an increase of over fiscal year as compared to a increase in fiscal year over fiscal year  primarily due to increased personnel and facility costs to support the growth of our business  increased efforts to enhance our management information systems  increased costs relating to product liability insurance largely due to the expansion of our business and legal costs associated with the growth of our intellectual property portfolio and ongoing litigation see note e to our consolidated financial statements and part i  item legal proceedings in this form k 
general and administrative costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   largely due to approximately million of costs such as business insurance and personnel related costs at our domestic surgical products business acquired in march  as well as an increase in legal costs of over million related to then pending litigation 

table of contents as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were in  and arbitration decision on november   deka products limited partnership deka initiated arbitration proceedings against us alleging that we underpaid royalties due to deka pursuant to a cross license agreement entered into in the deka agreement see note e to our consolidated financial statements and part i  item legal proceedings in this form k for details 
in march  the arbitration panel issued a partial final award in which it agreed with deka s interpretation of the deka agreement and on april   issued its final decision 
according to the award  we are required to pay a one percent royalty on the net sales of all thinprep pap test disposable components  both for the period from november  to december  the retroactive royalties as well as for future sales  plus interest related to the retroactive royalties 
the panel determined that the applicable statute of limitations limited the retroactive royalties to sales from november  the panel also awarded deka the recovery of audit costs related to the royalty audit conducted after the dispute arose  as well as reimbursement for a portion of deka s legal fees and expenses relating to the arbitration proceeding 
as to deka s other claims  with the exception of certain equitable defenses  the arbitration panel found in favor of us 
the panel rejected deka s contentions of bad faith  finding that we did not act irrationally or in a secretive manner  did not engage in deceptive trade practices and did not breach any fiduciary duties 
in addition  the panel rejected deka s claim for treble damages 
as a result of the arbitration panel s decision  we recorded a pre tax charge in the first quarter of fiscal year in the amount of million  which is in addition to the million previously recorded 
on may   we filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts as we believe the award manifestly disregarded applicable law as well as the language of the underlying agreement 
our motion to vacate the arbitration award was denied by the united states district court on july  on august   we filed a notice of appeal in the united states court of appeals for the first circuit  appealing the july  judgment of the district court 
oral arguments have been scheduled for february  given the stage of the appeal proceeding  we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate outcome of this appeal 
other expense income  net we recorded interest expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to our convertible notes due  which were issued on march   including amortization of million and million  respectively  of deferred financing costs associated with the issuance of these notes 
prior to the issuance of the convertible notes  we did not have any long term debt obligations 
interest income increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  as the average interest rate for our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities was higher during as compared to interest income also totaled million in fiscal year  reflecting consistent cash balances available for investment 
income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal year was  as compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
exclusive of the effects of the non deductible million in process research and development charge incurred in connection with the novacept acquisition in march  our effective tax rate for fiscal year was 
the decrease from fiscal year to is due to savings from tax planning initiatives which began in  as well as the impact in of the american jobs creation act of the decrease from fiscal year to fiscal year  excluding the impact of the million in process research and development charge  was primarily due to savings from tax planning initiatives 
we estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year will remain as we continue to recognize savings from these tax planning initiatives and the american jobs creation act of 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investment securities totaling million 
cash provided by operations was million for fiscal year  an increase of  as compared to cash from operations of million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of increasing net sales and current year utilization of favorable tax attributes included in the novacept and proxima acquisitions

our investing activities used cash of million in fiscal year  primarily related to the purchase of proxima in march  partially offset by net proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities 
as of december   we paid million of the proxima purchase price using a combination of cash  cash equivalents and investment securities to fund the purchase 
during fiscal year  we also invested million in equipment used under customer usage agreements  of which approximately million represented thinprep imaging systems for use at customer sites 
we also made million of capital expenditures during fiscal year  related primarily to our investment in manufacturing processes  facilities and information systems to support the growth of our business  as well as costs to manufacture the thinprep imaging system units to be placed at customer sites under usage agreements 
our investing activities used cash of million in fiscal year  primarily related to the purchase of novacept in march we paid million to purchase novacept  including acquisition related costs  using a combination of debt financing and cash on hand to fund the purchase

we also made million of capital expenditures during fiscal year  related primarily to the expansion of our manufacturing and administrative facilities to support the growth of our business as well as costs to manufacture the thinprep imaging system units to be placed at customer sites under usage agreements 
during fiscal year  we expect to spend between million and million for the manufacture of the thinprep imaging systems to be placed at customer sites  as well as for capital expenditures  including an investment in systems and infrastructure improvements and other machinery and equipment purchases to support the growth in our business 
in addition  we will pay million in fiscal year to the former shareholders of proxima resulting from contingent earn out payments earned during and included in the purchase price for proxima see note to the consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments 
we do not participate in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments for which the fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  or derivative commodity instruments 
at december   all of our investments are in municipal bonds and auction rate securities that are carried at fair value on our books 
accordingly  we have no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures 
our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalents and investment securities is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
our business outside the united states is conducted primarily in local currencies  except in costa rica  where the majority of business is conducted in the us dollar 
we have no foreign exchange contracts  option contracts  or other foreign hedging arrangements 
we estimate that any market risk associated with our international operations is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations
