in february  us legislation was signed into law that would end cdsoa distributions for imports covered by antidumping duty orders entering the us after september  instead  any such antidumping duties collected would remain with the us treasury 
this legislation is not expected to have a significant effect on potential cdsoa distributions in or  but would be expected to reduce likely distributions in years beyond  with distributions eventually ceasing 
there are a number of factors that can affect whether the company receives any cdsoa distributions and the amount of such distributions in any year 
these factors include  among other things  potential additional changes in the law  ongoing and potential additional legal challenges to the law  the administrative operation of the law and the status of the underlying antidumping orders

sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in the company s consolidated statement of income 
in april  the sec announced that the accounting provisions of sfas r are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after june  as a result  the company is now required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the company estimates that compensation expense related to employee stock options for fiscal is expected to be approximately million pretax  which will be reflected as compensation expense 
no expense is recognized for awards vested in prior periods 
this estimate assumes that the number and the fair value of stock options granted are similar to historical activity for all years 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs to be reported as financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow  as required under previous accounting literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
the company believes this reclassification will not have a material impact on its consolidated statement of cash flows

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas that require a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy is to recognize revenue when title passes to the customer 
this occurs at the shipping point  except for certain exported goods for which it occurs when the goods reach their destination 
selling prices are fixed based on purchase orders or contractual arrangements 
goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested for impairment at least annually 
furthermore  goodwill is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company engages an independent valuation firm and performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter after the annual forecasting process is completed 
in and  the fair values of the company s reporting units exceeded their carrying values  and no impairment losses were recognized 
however  in  the carrying value of the company s steel reporting units exceeded their fair value 
as a result  an impairment loss of million was recognized 
refer to note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring costs the company s policy is to recognize restructuring costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
detailed contemporaneous documentation is maintained and updated on a monthly basis to ensure that accruals are properly supported 
if management determines that there is a change in estimate  the accruals are adjusted to reflect this change 
benefit plans the company sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans  which cover eligible associates 
the company also sponsors several unfunded postretirement plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees and dependents 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including discount rate  return on pension plan assets  rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 
the discount rate is determined using a model that matches corporate bond securities against projected future pension and postretirement disbursements 
actual pension plan asset performance either reduces or increases net actuarial gains or losses in the current year  which ultimately affects net income in subsequent years

table of contents for expense purposes in  the company applied a discount rate of and an expected rate of return of for the company s pension plan assets 
for expense  the company reduced the discount rate to 
the assumption for expected rate of return on plan assets was not changed from for the lower discount rate will result in an increase in pretax pension expense of approximately million 
a percentage point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately million for a percentage point reduction in the expected rate of return would increase pension expense by approximately million for effective on january   the company made revisions to certain benefit programs for its us based employees  resulting in a pretax curtailment gain of million 
depending on an associate s combined age and years of service with the company on january   defined benefit pension plan benefits were reduced or replaced by a new defined contribution plan 
the company no longer subsidizes retiree medical coverage for those associates who did not meet a threshold of combined age and years of service with the company on january  for measurement purposes for postretirement benefits  the company assumed a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost health care cost trend rate for medical benefits of for  declining gradually to in and thereafter  and for  declining gradually to in and thereafter for prescription drug benefits 
the assumed health care cost trend rate may have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased the total service and interest components by million and would have increased the postretirement obligation by million 
a one percentage point decrease would provide corresponding reductions of million and million  respectively 
the us medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of the medicare act was signed into law on december  the medicare act provides for prescription drug benefits under medicare part d and contains a subsidy to plan sponsors who provide actuarially equivalent prescription plans

fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of fsp 
during  the company s actuary determined that the prescription drug benefit provided by the company s postretirement plan is considered to be actuarially equivalent to the benefit provided under the medicare act 
the effects of the medicare act are reductions to the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of million and to the net periodic postretirement benefit cost of million 
no medicare cash subsidies were received in income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company estimates current tax due and temporary differences  resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
based on known and projected earnings information and prudent tax planning strategies  the company then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized 
if the company determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a charge is recorded to establish a valuation allowance against it  which increases income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
if the company later determines that realization of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not  a reduction in the valuation allowance is recorded  which reduces income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
net deferred tax assets relate primarily to pension and postretirement benefits and tax loss and credit carryforwards  which the company believes are more likely than not to result in future tax benefits 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
historically  actual results have not differed significantly from those used in determining the estimates described above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in short term interest rates related to several separate funding sources impact the company s earnings 
these sources are borrowings under an asset securitization  borrowings under the million senior credit facility  floating rate tax exempt us municipal bonds with a weekly reset mode and short term bank borrowings at international subsidiaries 
the company is also sensitive to market risk for changes in interest rates  as they influence million of debt that is subject to interest rate swaps 
the company has interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million to hedge a portion of its fixed rate debt 
under the terms of the interest rate swaps  the company receives interest at fixed rates and pays interest at variable rates 
the maturity dates of the interest rate swaps are january  and february  if the market rates for short term borrowings increased by one percentage point around the globe  the impact would be an increase in interest expense of million with a corresponding decrease in income before income taxes of the same amount 
the amount was determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost  year end debt balances by category and an estimated impact on the tax exempt municipal bonds interest rates 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar compared to foreign currencies  predominately in european countries  also impact the company s earnings 
the greatest risk relates to products shipped between the company s european operations and the united states 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge these intercompany transactions 
additionally  hedges are used to cover third party purchases of product and equipment 
as of december   there were million of hedges in place 
a uniform weakening of the us dollar against all currencies would have resulted in a charge of million for these hedges 
in addition to the direct impact of the hedged amounts  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive
