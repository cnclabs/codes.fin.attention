item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the results of operations for compared with and compared with  and changes in financial condition during the company s fiscal year ends on the last saturday of december and included weeks during as compared with weeks in both and this information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial information provided in item of this annual report 
the company s primary means of distributing its product is through independent sales organizations and individuals  which are also its customers 
the majority of the company s products are in turn sold to end customers who are not members of the company s sales forces 
the company is largely dependent upon these independent sales organizations and individuals to reach end consumers and any significant disruption of this distribution network would have a negative financial impact on the company and its ability to generate sales  earnings and operating cash flows 
the company s primary business drivers are the size  activity and productivity of its independent sales organizations 
estimates included herein are those of the company s management and are subject to the disclosure in the forward looking statements section at the end of this item overview overall  the company finished the year with sales up four percent with minimal net impact from foreign currencies 
all segments were up in reported and local currency sales except north america 
beauticontrol north america led sales growth this year as a result of recruiting and activating a larger sales force 
latin america followed with strong growth as well  coming from all areas  particularly mexico 
both asia pacific and europe had slight sales growth 
north america declined significantly due to a decrease in the size of the total and active sales force 
on december   the company closed an acquisition of sara lee corporation s direct selling businesses  now called international beauty see discussion in liquidity and capital resources and note to the consolidated financial statements 
this segment contributed million in sales and million in profit in the fourth quarter of this acquisition was made to advance the strategy  begun with the acquisition of beauticontrol in  of adding consumable items to the product category mix by expanding into beauty and personal care products 
for the year  net income was down two percent primarily as a result of financing costs incurred associated with the acquisition of international beauty 
profit from the segments was up due to the sales increases discussed above and a significant reduction in the north america loss as a result of value chain improvements 
other items impacting net income were fewer gains from the company s land sales program based on the timing of closing deals in  along with higher re engineering and impairment charges 
these items resulted in a net decline in income before taxes and accounting change of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company received a significant tax benefit associated with settling its pre june income taxes with its former parent company 
this benefit  along with the impact of other tax audit resolutions during the year and year end tax planning transactions  resulted in a negative full year provision for income taxes of million 
also  during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
as a result  it recognized a million net of income tax benefit charge for the cumulative effect of an accounting change to account for conditional environmental liabilities at facilities in the united states and belgium 
in  the company generated cash flow from operating activities of million  which included the fourth quarter collection of million in connection with the tax settlement with the company s former parent company 
of this amount  approximately million was previously carried as a receivable on the company s balance sheet 
the year end debt to total capital ratio was percent compared with percent last year due to the additional debt issued to acquire international beauty see additional discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements and in the liquidity and capital resources section 
consolidated results of operations net sales and net income net sales increased four percent in  both as reported and in local currency including a million positive impact from foreign exchange 
strong sales contributions were made by beauticontrol north america and latin america along with slight sales improvements from last year in europe and asia pacific 
the improvement in asia pacific came from the impact of a recall related to third party sourced product during that resulted in a million reduction in sales million at exchange rates 
there was no negative impact on profitability as the vendor reimbursed the company for lost profit and related costs 
the sales increases were partially offset by north america where sales declined significantly 
net income was down two percent in spite of improvements from last year in both sales and profit from the segments 
this was primarily due to higher interest expense and re engineering and impairment charges  along with lower land sales 
the company had a negative provision for income taxes due to a settlement related to pre june taxes as well as various audit settlements and planning transactions 
the company will adopt sfas r  share based payment in  which requires the company to record compensation expense for all unvested options that were issued prior to the company s adoption of fair value accounting 
these options were not previously considered under the company s decision to adopt fair value accounting prospectively 
this change will result in approximately million of incremental expense in each of and if the options vest over the longest possible time frame  or the same total amount more quickly if they vest sooner based on stock price appreciation as provided in the awards 
additionally  will include an incremental million of compensation expense related to clarification from the securities and exchange commission regarding accounting for stock options granted to retiree eligible participants see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
this change does not impact the total compensation cost to be recognized but does accelerate it 
net sales and net income net sales increased three percent in due to a weaker us dollar  primarily versus the euro 
excluding this million favorable impact  net sales declined two percent 
in local currency  europe was about flat with while latin america posted a strong increase and beauticontrol north america was up substantially 
offsetting these improvements were large declines in both north america and asia pacific 
partially responsible for the decline in asia pacific was the impact of the product recall noted above 
specific commentary regarding the segments is included in the regional results section of this md a 
in  net income increased significantly 
the higher net income was as a result of significant improvement in all of the company s reporting segments with the exception of north america  which incurred a larger loss than in a portion of the improvement in the segments was due to a weaker us dollar  primarily versus the euro 
in local currency  beauticontrol north america had a significant increase and latin america was up sharply 
europe and asia pacific both had strong increases in local currency profit 
also contributing to the improved net income were lower total unallocated costs as well as higher gains resulting from the disposition of property 
a lower effective tax rate  discussed in the tax rate section  further contributed to the improved net income 
included in these net improvements was the offsetting impact of higher expenses for stock based compensation 
the company prospectively adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock options in while this change had a minimal impact on results due to the timing of grants  which were largely awarded late in the year  it resulted in a pretax expense of approximately million in that was recorded in the applicable segment or unallocated as it related to corporate participants 
unallocated expenses the company allocates corporate operating expenses to its reporting segments based upon estimated time spent related to those segments where a direct relationship is present and based upon segment revenue for general expenses 
the unallocated expenses reflect amounts unrelated to segment operations 
allocations are determined at the beginning of the year based upon estimated expenditures and are not adjusted 
the unallocated expenses declined during as compared with primarily due to decreases in professional service fees related to the company s compliance with the sarbanes oxley act partially offset by increased centralized global marketing costs 
during  the company continued its program to sell land for development near its orlando  florida headquarters which began in pretax gains totaling million million after tax were recognized as a result of transactions completed during this amount compared with pretax gains of million million after tax during gains on land transactions are recorded based upon when the transactions close and proceeds are collected 
transactions in one period may not be representative of what may occur in other periods 
in  the company also recognized a million gain related to the partial settlement of an insurance claim related to hurricane damage incurred at the company s headquarters 
based upon transactions currently in various stages of negotiation and closure  management expects gains on sales of property for development of approximately million during included in net income were pretax charges of million for re engineering and impairment compared with million in million and million after tax  respectively 
these charges are discussed in the re engineering costs section following 
international operations accounted for  and percent of the company s sales in  and  respectively 
they also accounted for percent of the company s net segment profit in and all of the company s net segment profit in and the inclusion of a full year of international beauty results of operations in is expected to increase the percent contribution from international operations 
gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased to percent in compared with percent in  which was up from percent in the lower gross margin percentage in was primarily due to higher raw material costs  particularly resin  and higher promotional sales in europe in an effort to stimulate sales force recruiting  customer demand and party attendance 
management currently estimates that raw material price increases in will result in an approximate million increase to cost of products sold 
on an overall basis in  the increase was largely the result of better pricing and mix as well as reduced manufacturing costs which offset the impact of lower volume in north america 
specific segment commentary is included in the regional results section of this md a 
costs and expenses delivery  sales and administrative expense ds a as a percentage of sales was   and percent  in   and  respectively 
in  the decline in ds a as a percent of sales was due to a continued focus on operating expense reductions throughout the company  particularly in north america despite the lower sales volume 
in  the decline was due to lower distribution expenses as a result of cost reduction efforts  more effective promotional programs and a reduced provision for uncollectible accounts 
these impacts were partially offset by an increase in unallocated expenses  excluding foreign exchange charges  which are included in other expense 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company includes costs related to the distribution of its products in delivery  sales and administrative expense 
as a result  the company s gross margin may not be comparable with other companies that include these costs in cost of products sold 
re engineering costs 
as the company continuously evaluates its operating structure in light of current business conditions and strives to maintain the most efficient possible cost structure  it periodically implements actions designed to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency 
these actions may result in re engineering costs related to facility downsizing and closure as well as related asset write downs and other costs that may be necessary in light of the revised operating landscape 
in addition  the company may recognize gains upon disposal of closed facilities 
over the past three years  the company has incurred such costs gains as detailed below that were included in the following income statement captions in millions re engineering and impairment charges cost of products sold delivery  sales and administrative expense total pretax re engineering costs total after tax re engineering costs in  re engineering and impairment charges of million included million primarily related to severance costs incurred to reduce headcount in the company s south carolina  orlando  australian mold making  belgium  france and portugal operations 
in december  the company reached a decision to restructure its manufacturing facility  in hemingway  south carolina 
in  the company implemented its plans related to the hemingway facility  which resulted in the elimination of positions and pretax severance and outplacement costs of approximately million 
an additional million of severance was recorded for the elimination of positions in the company s united states sales operation 
the balance of the million charge was largely related to impairment charges recorded to write down the value of certain of the company s united states warehousing and distribution capacity and related equipment  as well as a former manufacturing facility in halls  tennessee 
in addition to headcount reductions  an additional million of pretax costs were incurred to relocate equipment to other facilities 
as a result of the capacity shift  the company also realized a million net reduction of its reserve for united states produced inventory that is accounted for under the last in first out lifo method as that inventory was sold 
both of these items were recorded in cost of goods sold 
in  the re engineering and impairment charges included severance costs of approximately million primarily related to headcount reductions in the united states  japan and the philippines 
the philippines action also resulted in an asset impairment charge of approximately million 
also included in charges was a million write off of currency translation adjustments related to the company s decision to liquidate a foreign subsidiary during the year  which was previously classified in other comprehensive income 
the decision in december of to restructure the manufacturing facility in hemingway  south carolina in early resulted in an asset impairment charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of partially offsetting these charges was the reversal of approximately million of prior accruals primarily due to lower than estimated severance costs in europe as all activities were concluded 
in  the re engineering and impairment charges included net severance costs of approximately million primarily related to downsizing north american and brazilian operations and to a lesser degree  the mexican and corporate headquarters staffs 
in addition  there were impairment charges of approximately million primarily related to a write down of the company s former halls  tennessee manufacturing facility as well a write down of its net investment in argentina as a result of a decision to liquidate its legal entity and operate strictly under an importer model 
the delivery  sales and administrative expense related to a charge for bad debts related to an adjustment to the brazilian business model in connection with the downsizing 
for further details of the re engineering actions  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
tax rate 
the effective tax rates for   and were   and percent  respectively 
in  the company reached a settlement with its former parent company resulting in a cash receipt of approximately million including interest related to pre june tax liabilities 
this generated a net tax benefit of approximately million after considering amounts previously recorded as a receivable on the company s balance sheet and a provision for taxes related to the interest portion of the settlement 
this transaction  together with various audit settlements and year end tax planning transactions  resulted in the negative provision for income taxes for in  the rate reflected the impact of re engineering actions and gains on property dispositions  including the hurricane related insurance gain discussed earlier  as well as the net favorable resolution of domestic and international tax audit contingencies 
in addition  the rate reflected a significant tax benefit related to the liquidation of the company s argentine legal entity 
the company has recognized deferred tax assets based upon its analysis of the likelihood of realizing the benefits inherent in them and where it has concluded that it is more likely than not that the benefits would ultimately be realized and as such  no valuation allowance was necessary 
this assessment was based upon expectations of improving domestic operating results as well as anticipated gains related to the company s sales of land held for development near its orlando  florida headquarters 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions may be entered into to facilitate realization of these benefits 
refer to the critical accounting policies section for additional discussion of the company s methodology for evaluating deferred tax assets 
management expects a tax rate of approximately percent for based upon anticipated improvement in domestic operating results  the inclusion of international beauty operations for the full year and the absence of the benefit for resolution of tax contingencies as outlined above 
net interest 
the company incurred million of net interest expense compared with million of net interest expense in and million in the sharp increase in was due to slightly higher interest rates in along with the requirement to pay a make whole payment of million for the call of the company s million notes in connection with entering into new financing arrangements for the acquisition of international beauty and million for the discharge of obligations related to million of bonds due in issuance costs of approximately million related to retired debt were also written off as part of interest expense 
a credit of million to recognize net deferred gains on an interest rate swaps related to these debt agreements that were previously closed offset some of this expense 
interest expense also included a million payment to close an interest rate hedge the company previously entered to lock in the base interest rate on the previously expected refinancing of its notes 
as the company s progress in its acquisition of international beauty made it no longer probable in the third quarter of that the debt would be refinanced  this agreement was no longer an effective hedge 
see additional discussion in liquidity and capital resources 
the decline in reflected the company s entering into two interest rate swap agreements discussed below and the lower resulting interest rates during also contributing to the decline was lower debt levels during the year 
offsetting the impacts of these items was the absence of a adjustment related to prior hedging activity 
on july   the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements on a portion of its long term debt effective september  the company received premiums totaling approximately million for both agreements 
the swap agreements totaled a notional amount of million and were to expire in the company received semi annual interest payments at percent and made floating rate interest payments based on the six month libor rate plus a spread of about percentage points 
these interest rate swap agreements were terminated in conjunction with the acquisition financing for international beauty as discussed above 
reflecting current interest rates  projected borrowings and their effective term structure  and additional debt outstanding due to the international beauty acquisition  management anticipates that net interest expense will be approximately million

the emerging markets of russia  turkey and poland had strong increases in with growth of percent from last year 
the largest sales growth contribution came from russia  which was up over percent and contributed the largest dollar increase from last year of all markets in the segment 
south africa and france also contributed nicely to sales growth from due to larger total and active sales forces 
these positive results were partially offset by large sales declines in the nordics  netherlands  austria and germany 
the segment s largest market  germany  was down eight percent from last year 
while it ended the year with a larger sales force size  for most of the year it operated at a sales force size disadvantage 
additionally  a sales force size advantage for most of the fourth quarter did not offset lower sales force productivity due to a difficult consumer environment 
sales in in germany totaled million  as compared with million in  translated at exchange rates 
the german market also accounts for a substantial portion of the segment s profit 
the segment overall ended the year with a percent sales force size advantage and achieved a six percent average active sales force size advantage in the fourth quarter of versus overall  the segment s sales decline absent the business to business impact noted above was due to lower sales volume  partially offset by a slight increase in overall pricing 
the average pricing increase was negatively impacted by the mix of products sold 
there was also a negative impact from the mix of markets generating sales 
the emerging markets tend to sell products with lower average price points than those of western europe 
although local currency sales increased slightly  profit was down percent as reported and percent in local currency primarily due to a lower gross margin and higher operating expenses 
the lower gross margin was a result of higher resin costs  which were not totally offset by price increases  and a less favorable sales mix 
the increased operating expenses were primarily for higher promotional expenses in germany to increase the size of the sales force 
management expects european sales to be about even with in local currency 
continued growth in emerging and developing markets will be offset by a difficult comparison from high business to business sales in the return on sales is expected to remain at about percent 
asia pacific net sales for the year increased slightly both as reported and in local currency 
this comparison benefited from the inclusion in of a product recall in japan of million  at the foreign exchange rate 
excluding this benefit  local currency sales would have been flat 
significant sales increases in china and korea combined with a strong increase in australia were partially offset by significant sales declines in japan and the philippines 
in china  direct selling has been limited by law  and the company reaches consumers through independent store fronts 
china sales grew over percent and contributed the largest dollar increase in the asia pacific segment during with almost  storefronts operating at the end of  which was up over percent from last year 
storefront sales productivity was up as well 
korea benefited from higher business to business transactions and core sales during the year  while australia grew sales through a higher active and more productive sales force 
although sales declined in japan  strategic progress was made through focus on the product and the party 
more specifically  in  the product mix was rebalanced to obtain more sales from full price products versus discounted items  which resulted in a better gross margin 
promotional programs encouraged the sales force to sell product benefits rather than sell at a discount 
additionally  the selling process was improved along with the catalogues and brochures to appeal more to the end consumer 
these actions all support moving toward a direct selling sales force rather than a wholesale buyers club 
in the second half of the year in japan  the year over year average active sales force size declines stabilized and sales force productivity turned positive 
the philippines had a large decline in active sales force size  which resulted in a significant sales decline partially due to the poor economic and political climate in this market 
asia pacific had a small decline in overall sales volume for the year  but was able to offset that with a more favorable mix of products sold as well as lower overall sales discounting as noted above in the japan commentary 
in spite of a slight sales increase  both reported and local currency profit declined moderately reflecting results in japan and the philippines  including increased promotional spending in the philippines in an attempt to stimulate sales force growth and sales in while competing in a difficult economic environment 
the product recall in japan mentioned earlier had no impact on the profitability comparison as the vendor reimbursed the company for lost profit and costs related to the recall 
effective january   the company will change its reporting segments to incorporate the management structure put in place following the international beauty acquisition 
asia pacific will be reported along with mexico  and the philippines will be included in the international beauty segment 
management expects local currency sales and profit for asia pacific and mexico to be up by low single digit percentages in  reflecting continued growth in australia  mexico and china and weakness in japan 
latin america latin america had a strong increase in sales for the year that included a slight benefit from a weaker us dollar 
local currency sales increased percent driven by improvements in all areas  particularly mexico 
the sales increase in mexico was driven by an increase in the total and active sales force count along with continued growth in the sale of beauticontrol products 
beauty sales grew percent compared with and accounted for percent of mexican sales 
venezuela and brazil also contributed to the increase for the year 
in brazil  the sales force was smaller but more productive than the prior year  as there was an increase in volume as well as improved pricing 
venezuela s sales force advantage led to the current year increase  which was mostly driven by higher volume and  to a lesser extent  improved pricing 
this segment had sequential improvement every quarter in the average active sales force size and finished the year with a fourth quarter advantage of nine percent 
the overall sales increase was driven largely by lower product discounting that led to higher average price points 
as expected  the reduced discounting did lead to some erosion of sales volume 
segment profit improved slightly due to sales growth in this segment 
however  profit growth was less than sales growth due to strategic investments made to expand beauticontrol s sales contribution in mexico 
additionally  an unfavorable sales mix impacted profit 
effective january   all tupperware markets in latin america  except mexico  will be reported in the international beauty segment reflecting a new management structure designed to capitalize on the catalog merchandising programs that work well in south america  as well as to gain back end synergies 
the outlook for the latin american markets is included within the segment they will be reported under going forward 
north america north america had a substantial decline in sales in as sales volume declined and was only partially offset by an improved product mix that included fewer sales force support items 
this was due almost exclusively to the performance in the united states  which continued to struggle and had a percent decline in the number of average active sellers in versus the company is seeking to improve its us business through a refreshed  interactive party format  continuing to introduce innovative and fashion forward products  public relations activities to ensure a broad understanding of the company s current product categories  innovations and fashionability and a better balance between its emphasis on products and its sales force earnings opportunity 
in april  the company completed its implementation of a multi tier compensation system for its sales force 
the new system is more competitive in the us market than the previous format and emphasizes building one s business through recruiting 
the company is currently training its independent sales force to operate successfully under this new model 
the new model offers life time rather than temporary commissions on the sales of people within a consultant s downline organization  removes geographic boundaries for recruiting within the nation and provides everyone within the sales force the opportunity to reach the top level of the organization without significant monetary investment 
there was a significant decrease in the segment loss for the year in spite of the substantial sales decline  also from the united states results 
this was largely due to value chain improvements implemented during and including a restructure of its manufacturing operations in hemingway  south carolina to source the majority of its products from the company s other manufacturing facilities 
the company also realized a net benefit of million from reduced lifo reserve needs as united states produced inventory was sold 
additionally  the united states benefited from an approximate million reallocation of corporate overhead charges 
during the fourth quarter of  there was million of restructuring costs recorded for the us market primarily related to warehousing and distribution 
going into  the focus will continue to be on improving the value chain  including the cost base  in expectation of a lower loss in  although management expects sales to be down by a single digit percentage 
beauticontrol north america beauticontrol north america had substantial increases in both sales and segment profit again in which were largely volume related 
a higher proportion of sales of low priced items to support increased recruiting resulted in a slightly lower average selling price 
the improved performance was a result of substantial increases in both the total and active sales forces during the year with the business closing with a percent advantage in the total sales force 
beauticontrol has now had consecutive quarters of sales increases 
the sales force growth was fueled by both a strong earnings opportunity and an easy  replicable interactive party experience  the spa escape 
both of these drivers permit a natural flow to recruiting as party attendees are drawn by the experience to inquire as to the earnings opportunity  which is also a very powerful motivator 
these factors  when combined with continued sales force leadership development  all provide the impetus for continued growth 
the sales growth was the primary reason for the profit improvement along with the absence of an approximate million charge in the first quarter of related to an accrual for legal matters and an executive retirement 
management expects sales in to increase by a double digit percentage and to generate an improved return on sales 
international beauty international beauty sales and profit were included in the company s results beginning on december  with the closing of the acquisition of sara lee corporation s direct selling businesses 
the sales and profit were million and million  respectively  including million of purchase accounting amortization 
sales and profit were strong in mexico and south africa  partially offset by some weakness in australia and the philippines 
after considering incremental interest expense related to the acquisition  this segment had little net impact on earnings 
going forward  this segment will include the acquired businesses along with tupperware central and south america and the philippines 
in  management expects local currency sales to increase organically by to percent  with greater growth in profit from continuing good results in mexico and a lower investment in south america

europe the strong increase in european sales was due to the stronger euro during excluding this impact  sales were about flat with this result reflected the impact of several markets doing very well whose impact was offset by others that did not perform as well 
the best result of the year was in russia  the segment s leading emerging market  which had a significant sales increase on the heels of the continued growth of the sales force as the market continues to expand 
in addition  another emerging market  turkey  had a substantial increase in sales during the year 
both markets benefited from larger total and active sales forces 
also  russia experienced a nearly percent growth in its distributor count 
poland  the segment s other key emerging market showed a modest sales increase for the year 
combined  the emerging markets grew nearly percent during the year 
also contributing sales increases were south africa  which was up significantly  and the nordics which had a strong increase for the year 
south africa benefited from significantly larger total and active sales forces and the nordics had a strong increase in its total active sales force which resulted in a slightly higher active sales force 
the nordics also benefited from a significant business to business transaction 
overall  however  business to business sales were down nearly million  at consistent exchange rates 
the segment s largest market  germany  finished the year about flat with while it struggled at times  particularly in the middle part of the year  the market was able to counter continuing difficult economic conditions and low consumer spending as the year closed 
for  total sales in this market were million as compared with million in  translated at exchange rates 
offsetting the favorable results noted above  austria had a large decline for the year  due primarily to the absence of a significant business to business transaction that occurred in france recorded a modest decline due to lower sales force productivity 
overall for the segment  better pricing and an improved product mix offset the impact of lower sales volume 
the segment was able to maintain a strong advantage in total and active sales force to carry into despite the flat local currency sales  the segment had a good increase in profit even after excluding the benefit of the stronger euro 
this improvement was led by sales related increases in south africa  russia and the nordics 
it further benefited from lower manufacturing costs and lower provisions for uncollectible receivables 
additionally  continuing cost control activities benefited most of the markets and helped germany post a slight increase in profit 
the segment s gross margin was up slightly during the year on the strength of the improved performance in manufacturing noted above 
asia pacific net sales for the year declined modestly as the combination of a significant increase in the philippines along with continued sharp growth in china were insufficient to counter the impact of substantial declines in japan and indonesia 
after excluding the favorable impact of stronger currencies versus the us dollar  particularly the australian dollar and japanese yen  sales had a large decline compared with in addition to the philippines and china  malaysia singapore increased modestly and australia had a slight sales increase 
strong recruiting propelled the philippines and resulted in a good increase in the total sales force size and a substantial increase in the active sales force 
china continued to expand its number of outlets and increased focus on outlet productivity has also been successful 
in china  there were over  storefronts open at the end of the improvement in malaysia singapore was largely the result of increases in the first half of the year as the absence of a business to business transaction that was completed in as well as lower recruiting hurt results in the second half of the year 
countering these impacts in malaysia singapore was the continued growth of beauty sales during whose contribution doubled as compared with australia finished with a flat total sales force and a modest decline in the active sales force but was able to end the year on a high note with a strong sales increase and a slightly improved active sales force in the fourth quarter 
even before the devastating tsunami that hit indonesia  the market had experienced some sales force and related sales declines 
in japan  the company began its transition from a wholesale buyer s method offering a large proportion of high priced  third party sourced products back to a party plan business promoting an earnings opportunity with a core tupperware product line 
as a result  the market experienced a significant sales decline for the year 
this decline was compounded by the negative impact of the product recall discussed earlier in the net sales section 
despite the sales decline  the segment had a substantial increase in profit 
though partially buoyed by a stronger australian dollar  even in local currency terms  the segment finished the year with a strong increase in profitability 
the increase was led by china s sales growth as well as cost containment efforts  particularly in the philippines  korea and australia 
improved cost performance in manufacturing  primarily from lower mold costs  also contributed to the increase 
the product recall in japan mentioned earlier had no impact on profitability as the vendor agreed to reimburse the company for lost profit and costs related to the recall 
overall  the segment had a modest increase in its gross margin rate after considering the impact of the product recall which had the effect of increasing the margin rate slightly as it reduced sales but did not impact the gross margin dollar amount 
this improvement was due to higher volume that offset the impact of unfavorable pricing  largely due to the transition of the japanese market noted above which results in the sale of a lower priced product line as well as lower sales force statistics during the transition 
latin america latin america had a slight increase in sales for the year that was hampered by a stronger us dollar  primarily as it compared with the mexican peso and the venezuelan bolivar 
excluding this impact  sales for the year had a strong increase versus there was improvement in all of the segment s major markets of mexico  the largest  venezuela and brazil 
while the segment generally posted lower sales force statistics over the year  these declines were largely the result of tighter standards being put in place that the company believes will ultimately result in a more active and productive sales force 
beauty sales grew over percent in mexico in to reach nine percent of total mexican sales versus approximately seven percent in in addition to the expansion of beauty  mexico was able to stabilize its business during to register a slight sales increase during the year 
improved pricing in venezuela and brazil  as well as improved volume in venezuela  provided the impetus for substantial sales increases in both markets 
these sales increases  as well as continued improvement in the cost structures in all markets  particularly venezuela and brazil  led to a sharp increase in local currency profit for the segment after considering the negative foreign exchange impact of weaker currencies in mexico  venezuela and brazil 
the gross margin rate for the segment was about flat with last year as good improvement in brazil was offset by slight decrements in both venezuela and mexico 
the decline in mexico was largely due to an increase in discounts on the core tupperware line of products as it worked to stabilize the business 
this impact was partially offset by a strong increase in volume as well as a lower proportion of support items sold during the year compared with the improvement in brazil was largely pricing related which offset a slight decrease in volume 
north america north america had a substantial decline in local currency sales after considering a small benefit from a stronger canadian dollar 
this decline was due almost exclusively to the performance in the united states which continued to struggle with the transformation outlined in the discussion of results in versus the active sales force was down percent during the significant increase in the segment loss for the year was also from the united states results 
this was largely due to a decrease in sales volume which led to higher manufacturing costs per unit as well as increased charges related to excess inventory 
the negative impacts in overwhelmed the benefits derived from cost control measures previously put in place 
beauticontrol north america beauticontrol north america had an outstanding year with substantial increases in both sales and segment profit 
this performance was a result of substantial increases in both the total and active sales forces during the year and the business closed with a percent advantage in the total sales force 
the sales growth was the primary reason for the profit improvement despite a million charge in the first quarter of related to an accrual for legal matters and an executive retirement 
the litigation was settled later in the year with minimal incremental impact on profit 
the segment also improved its gross margin percentage during the year primarily through changing the format of its kit of products for new consultants 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources 
working capital increased  reaching million as of december  compared with million as of december  and million as of december  the current ratio was to at the end of compared with to at the end of and to at the end of the million overall working capital increase in relation to the acquisition of international beauty is summarized as follows in millions vs international beauty tax accruals related to international beauty acquisition pre acquisition existing business total working capital increase the working capital increase  exclusive of the impact from international beauty  was due to an increase in cash primarily from cash generated from operations  including the settlement of pre june income taxes with the company s former parent  along with proceeds received upon the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the pay down of debt 
another impact was a decrease in accounts payable in the existing businesses primarily due to the timing of year end 
the december year end for resulted in more of the company s trade payables coming due before the end of the year 
of the company s year end cash balance of million  approximately million  including the tax accruals shown above  are expected to be paid out in connection with the acquisition 
the tax accruals related to international beauty are for approximately million of taxes withheld for the benefit of a subsidiary of sara lee corporation related to the sale of the mexican operations and other income tax items related to the acquisition 
the working capital increase was primarily due to a more than doubling of cash on hand to million 
the increase was due to cash generated by operations  proceeds from asset disposition  largely related to the company s sale of land for development in orlando  florida  as well as lower debt payments as a majority of the company s long term debt does not begin to mature until also contributing to the working capital increase was an increase in non trade amounts receivable largely related to value added tax receivables in greece  which had a legal structure change that delayed collection 
further contributing to the increase in working capital was the weaker us dollar compared with currencies in a majority of the company s overseas operations 
this impact was responsible for approximately million of the net increase 
during  the company wrote off approximately million of current accounts receivable against previously established allowances  primarily in latin america with no impact on income 
in conjunction with closing the international beauty acquisition on december   the company entered into a new credit agreement that included a seven year million term loan bearing an annual interest rate of basis points over the libor rate and a million revolving credit facility 
this agreement replaced its previously existing million revolving line of credit 
the company used cash on hand and the term loan borrowings to fund the amount due to sara lee corporation  to discharge its then outstanding million notes due in and to repay its million notes due in the settlement of the notes required make whole payments to the note holders of approximately million 
in anticipation of this transaction  the company closed fixed to variable interest rate swaps with combined notional amounts totaling million that were scheduled to expire in with the notes 
these swaps were entered to convert the company s million notes from fixed to variable interest rates 
closing these swaps resulted in a loss of approximately million that was recorded as a component of income when the notes were settled 
as also discussed in the market risk section  the company exited an agreement to lock in a fixed year treasury rate that was to provide the base interest for an anticipated refinancing of its million notes 
the million cost to exit this arrangement was recorded as a component of interest expense in the third quarter of in addition to the amounts discussed above  upon closure of the transaction  the company expensed unamortized debt issuance costs relating to the settled debt totaling approximately million as well as net gains deferred related to previously terminated hedging arrangements associated with the settled debt 
these net gains were approximately million 
unamortized debt issuance costs of approximately million related to the company s existing revolving credit agreement were added to the costs related to the new revolver and are being amortized over its year term 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of the company s domestic assets and percent of its stock in its significant foreign subsidiaries 
principal payments on the term loan are percent of the original amount per year in years to and the first quarters of year in quarterly installments 
the balance will be due in a balloon payment at the end of the seven year term 
the agreement also requires additional principal payments consisting of percent of cash generated from certain asset sales and new debt issuances as well as up to percent of excess cash flows 
excess cash flows are substantively defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures  required debt payments and dividends paid up to million annually 
the new debt agreement contains covenants of a similar nature to those under the previous agreement 
while the new covenants are more restrictive than the previous covenants and could inhibit the company s ability to pay dividends or buy back stock  the company currently believes it will be able to continue paying its current per share quarterly dividend under the covenant requirements 
the company will provide detailed covenant calculations in its first quarter q when the initial calculation is required under its credit agreement 
see further information in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s two debt rating agencies  standard and poor s and moody s  have both rated the new debt 
standard and poor s lowered its corporate credit rating of the company from bb to bb and assigned a stable outlook 
moody s lowered its corporate family rating of the company to ba as of december   the company had million available under its revolving line of credit and about million available under other uncommitted lines of credit 
current and committed borrowing facilities and cash generated by operating activities are expected to be adequate to finance working capital needs and capital expenditures 
the company s major markets for its products are australia  france  germany  japan  mexico and the united states 
a significant downturn in the company s business in these markets would adversely impact the company s ability to generate operating cash flows 
while the current downturns in japan  germany and the united states tupperware business noted earlier have limited the ability of these markets to contribute to the company s operating cash flows as compared with the past they have not resulted in a material negative impact to the company as a whole 
the combined favorable results in the other major markets as well as improvement in many smaller markets were sufficient to overcome the negative impact of the japanese  german and tupperware united states operating results on cash flows from operating activities 
operating cash flows would also be adversely impacted by significant difficulties in the recruitment  retention and activity of the company s independent sales force  the success of new products and promotional programs 
the debt to total capital ratio at the end of was percent compared with percent at the end of debt is defined as total debt and capital is defined as total debt plus shareholders equity 
the increase from the same period a year ago reflected increased debt from financing the acquisition of international beauty 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for was compared with million in and million in the increase from to was primarily due to million received in connection with settling pre june income taxes with the company s former parent 
the company also received a refund of approximately million from the united states internal revenue service in settlement of audits for the period to these items were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
there was a cash inflow from settling hedge contracts this year versus an outflow last year due to a weaker us dollar during than in investing activities 
for  and  the company spent  and million respectively  for capital expenditures 
the most significant type of spending in all years was for molds for new products with the greatest amount spent in europe 
the increase from last year was due to improvements made to property being developed for disposition  which will be recovered in future sales  as well as from manufacturing maintenance 
full year capital expenditures are expected to be about million reflecting an increase from for international beauty  capacity expansion at beauticontrol north america to service the growth environment there and for a manufacturing facility in europe 
partially offsetting the capital spending was million in and million in  of proceeds related to the sale of certain property  plant and equipment in addition to insurance proceeds received in for property damaged by a hurricane during the third quarter of the proceeds from the sales were primarily related to land for development near the company s orlando  florida headquarters 
cumulative proceeds from the company s program to sell land for development which began in  are now expected to be up to million by the end of  including million received through the end of expected proceeds for are million 
investing activities in also included a net cash outflow of million to acquire international beauty  which was funded by a new term loan and cash on hand 
see discussion above in liquidity and capital resources 
financing activities 
included net proceeds from issuance of term debt of million to fund the acquisition of international beauty and refinance existing debt 
see detailed discussion in liquidity and capital resources including settlement of historical debt and related covenant restrictions 
dividends 
during  and  the company declared dividends of per share of common stock totaling million  million and million  respectively 
at the time of its emergence as a publicly held corporation with its spin off from premark international  inc in may  the company established a target of paying percent of trailing four quarter income as a dividend 
at that time  such a policy equated to a dividend level of approximately per share annually 
despite decreases in income  the company has maintained sufficient cash flows from operations and dispositions of property to fund its historical requirement for cash over the period since the spin off  including working capital and capital spending needs  its share repurchase program concluded in  its acquisition of beauticontrol in  debt service and its dividend 
while the payment of a dividend on common shares is a discretionary decision made on a quarterly basis  in the absence of a significant event requiring cash  the company has no current expectation of altering the dividend level as projected cash flows from operations as well as additional property sales are expected to be sufficient to maintain the dividend without restricting the company s ability to finance its operations  make necessary investments in the future growth of the business of the nature included in its earnings outlook or its near term debt repayment obligations 
if there is an event requiring the use of cash  such as a strategic acquisition  the company would need to reevaluate whether to maintain its current dividend payout 
stock option exercises 
during  and  the company received proceeds of million  million  million  respectively  related to the issuance of stock options 
the corresponding shares were issued out of the company s balance held in treasury 
subscriptions receivable 
in october  a subsidiary of the company adopted a management stock purchase plan the mspp  which provides for eligible executives to purchase company stock using full recourse loans provided by the subsidiary 
under the mspp  in  the subsidiary issued full recourse loans for million to senior executives to purchase  shares representing the bulk of the shares issued under the program 
the mspp loans provide for the repayment of percent of the principal after and years with the remaining percent due at the end of the eighth year 
there were no new participants during   or during   and  respectively  two  two  and one participant left the company and sold   and  shares to the company  at the current market price  to satisfy loans totaling million  million  and million 
the mspp permits the surrender of shares in lieu of payment of the loan with the surrendered shares valued at the then current market price 
during the year executives surrendered  shares to satisfy million of loans and four participants made cash payments to satisfy loan payment obligations totaling million 
an additional participant left the company during and made a cash payment of million to satisfy the loan obligation 
also during  a participant elected to make a voluntary advance loan payment totaling million 
the participant who left the company in also paid approximately million to satisfy the remainder of his loan 
based upon the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  no further loans under this plan will be permitted 
based upon the loan payment schedule  the company expects to receive million of payments during see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the mspp 
in  the company made a non recourse  non interest bearing loan of million the loan to its chairman and chief executive officer chairman  the proceeds of which were used by the chairman to buy in the open market  shares of the company s common stock the shares 
the shares are pledged to secure the repayment of the loan 
the loan has been recorded as a subscription receivable and is due november   with voluntary prepayments permitted commencing on november  ten percent of any annual cash bonus awards are being applied against the balance of the loan 
as the loan is reduced by voluntary payments after november   the lien against the shares will be reduced 
the subscription receivable is being reduced as payments are received

application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported and disclosed amounts 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains current and long term receivable amounts with most of its independent distributors and sales force in certain markets 
the company regularly monitors and assesses its risk of not collecting amounts owed to it by its customers 
this evaluation is based upon an analysis of amounts currently and past due along with relevant history and facts particular to the customer 
it is also based upon estimates of distributor business prospects  particularly related to the evaluation of the recoverability of long term amounts due 
this evaluation is done market by market and account by account based upon historical experience  market penetration levels  access to alternative channels and similar factors 
it also considers collateral of the customer that could be recovered to satisfy debts 
based upon the results of this analysis  the company records an allowance for uncollectible accounts for this risk 
this analysis requires the company to make significant estimates  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon estimates of future demand 
the demand is estimated based upon the historical success of product lines as well as the projected success of promotional programs  new product introductions and new markets or distribution channels 
the company prepares projections of demand on an item by item basis for all of its products 
if inventory quantity exceeds projected demand  the excess inventory is written down 
however  if actual demand is less than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets also are recognized for credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted rates applicable to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse and the credits are expected to be used 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of the change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
an assessment is made as to whether or not a valuation allowance is required to offset deferred tax assets 
this assessment requires estimates as to future operating results as well as an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company s tax planning strategies 
these estimates are made based upon the company s business plans and growth strategies in each market and are made on an ongoing basis  consequently  future material changes in the valuation allowance are possible 
at the end of  the company had net domestic deferred tax assets of approximately million for which no valuation allowance has been provided 
of this total  approximately million relates to recurring type temporary differences which reverse regularly and are replaced by newly originated items 
the balance is expected to be realized within the next years based upon an increase in domestic income from beauticontrol north america as well as expected improvement in the united states tupperware business 
also  expected gains related to the company s previously discussed orlando land sales activities will result in the realization of a portion of these assets 
in addition  certain tax planning transactions are available to the company should they be necessary 
promotional and other accruals 
the company frequently makes promotional offers to its independent sales force to encourage them to meet specific goals or targets for sales levels  party attendance  recruiting or other business critical activities 
the awards offered are in the form of cash  product awards  special prizes or trips 
the cost of these awards is recorded during the period over which the sales force qualifies for the award 
these accruals require estimates as to the cost of the awards based upon estimates of achievement and actual cost to be incurred 
the company makes these estimates on a market by market and program by program basis 
it considers the historical success of similar programs  current market trends and perceived enthusiasm of the sales force when the program is launched 
during the promotion qualification period  actual results are monitored and changes to the original estimates that are necessary are made when known 
like the promotional accruals  other accruals are recorded at a time when the liability is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
adjustments to amounts previously accrued are made when changes in the facts and circumstances that generated the accrual occur 
valuation of goodwill 
the company conducts an annual impairment test of its recorded goodwill in the second quarter of each year 
additionally  in the event of a change in circumstances that would lead the company to believe that an impairment may have occurred  a test would be done at that time as well 
the company s recorded goodwill relates primarily to that generated by its acquisition of beauticontrol in october and international beauty in december the valuation of its goodwill is dependent upon the estimated fair market value of its beauticontrol operations both in north america and overseas and the historical segment operations of international beauty 
the company estimates the fair value of its beauticontrol operations and will estimate the value of its international beauty operations using discounted future cash flow estimates 
such a valuation requires the company to make significant estimates regarding future operations and the ability to generate cash flows including projections of revenue  costs  utilization of assets and capital requirements 
it also requires estimates in allocating the goodwill to the different segments that include beauticontrol operations  beauticontrol north america  latin america and asia pacific 
lastly  it requires estimates as to the appropriate discounting rates to be used 
the results of the reviews conducted to date related to beauticontrol indicate fair values in excess of the carrying values of the respective business operations 
the most sensitive estimate in this evaluation is the projection of operating cash flows as these provide the basis for the fair market valuation 
if operating cash flows were to be percent worse than projected  the company would still have no goodwill impairment in any segment 
if operating cash flows were to be more than percent worse than projected  the company would need to calculate a potential impairment as it relates to beauticontrol operations in latin america 
in both north america and asia pacific  a reduction of operating cash flows of more than percent would be required to necessitate calculating a potential impairment 
a significant impairment would have an adverse impact on the company s net income and could result in a lack of compliance with the company s debt covenants 
other intangible assets 
the company recorded as assets the fair value of various trademarks and trade names of million in conjunction with its acquisition of international beauty 
these amounts have an indefinite life and will be evaluated for impairment the same as discussed in goodwill valuation above 
additionally  the company recorded million for valuation of the international beauty sales force  and million for product formulations 
the estimated aggregate annual amortization expense associated with the above intangibles for each of the five succeeding years is million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
retirement obligations 
the company s employee pension and other post employment benefits health care costs and obligations are dependent on its assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include health care cost trend rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
the health care cost trend assumptions are based upon historical results  near term outlook and an assessment of long term trends 
the salary growth assumptions reflect the company s historical experience and outlook 
the long term return on plan assets are based upon historical results of the plan and investment market overall  as well as the company s belief as to the future returns to be earned over the life of the plans 
the discount rate is based upon current yields of aa rated corporate long term bond yields 
these assumptions can have a material impact on the company s financial results 
for example  a percentage point increase in the company s health care cost trend rate would have resulted in a million decrease in the company s pretax earnings for the year and a million increase in its obligation 
for each percentage point change in the domestic pension long term rate of return assumption  pretax earnings would change by approximately million 
the company s key assumptions and funding expectations are indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements 
for  the company increased its health care cost trend rate to percent for all participants grading down to percent in this change represented an increase of one percentage point for post participants and three percentage points for pre participants 
as a result  pretax expense related to the company s post employment health care plan increased approximately million 
additionally  it has reduced the discount rate to percent related to all domestic post employment plans which is expected to result in an additional approximately million of expense combined for all such plans 
unrecognized losses on post employment plans as shown in note to the consolidated financial statements are not expected to result in a material increase of pretax expense as compared with that of effective june   the company froze the accrual of benefits to participants under its domestic defined benefit pension plans 
this action necessitated a remeasurement of its accumulated benefit obligation under the plans and resulted in a pretax decrease of million million after tax 
this change results in the elimination of the service cost component of net periodic pension expense as it relates to these plans and an ongoing annual reduction of approximately million or about million as compared with due to an excess of lump sum retirement distributions from its domestic pension plans as compared with service and interest costs  the company recorded a settlement charge of approximately million in the company is currently still evaluating what  if any  impact such payments may have on the expense 
in conjunction with the benefit freeze  the company increased its basic contribution related to one of its domestic defined contribution plans from percent of eligible employee compensation up to the social security wage base to percent 
impact of inflation inflation as measured by consumer price indices has continued at a low level in most of the countries in which the company operates 
new pronouncements refer to discussion of new pronouncements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
market risk one of the company s market risks is its exposure to the impact of interest rate changes 
the company has elected to manage this risk through the maturity structure of its borrowings  interest rate swaps  the currencies in which it borrows and the interest rate lock described below 
the company has previously set a target  over time  of having approximately half of its borrowings with fixed rates based either on the stated terms or through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
as discussed earlier  the company s post acquisition term debt carries a variable interest rate 
the company entered into swap agreements in december and january to fix the rate on approximately half of the debt for at least three years at a rate of approximately percent 
if short term interest rates varied by percent the company s annual interest expense would be impacted by approximately million 
the company had intended to refinance its million notes when they came due in to protect itself from the risk of higher interest rates  in march  the company entered into an agreement to lock in a fixed year treasury rate of approximately percent that would provide the base interest for the debt to be issued in the refinancing 
this derivative was designated as a cash flow hedge and was recorded at its fair value on a quarterly basis 
in light of the refinancing necessary for the international beauty acquisition  the agreement was terminated since it was no longer an effective hedge 
this action resulted in a charge of million in interest expense during the third quarter of during  the company entered an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of billion japanese yen that matures on january  the company pays a fixed rate payment of percent semi annually and receives a japanese yen floating rate payment based on the libor rate which is determined two days before each interest payment date 
at inception the company believed that this agreement would provide a valuable economic hedge against rising interest rates in japan by converting the variable interest rate implicit in the company s rolling net equity hedges in japan to a fixed rate

a significant portion of the company s sales and profit comes from its international operations 
although these operations are geographically dispersed  which partially mitigates the risks associated with operating in particular countries  the company is subject to the usual risks associated with international operations 
these risks include local political and economic environments  and relations between foreign and us governments 
another economic risk of the company is exposure to foreign currency exchange rates on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of the company s international operations 
the company is not able to project in any meaningful way the possible effect of these fluctuations on translated amounts or future earnings 
this is due to the company s constantly changing exposure to various currencies  the fact that all foreign currencies do not react in the same manner in relation to the us dollar and the large number of currencies involved  although the company s most significant exposures are to the euro and mexican peso 
although this currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from the company s local product sourcing in many markets  a strengthening us dollar generally has a negative impact on the company 
in response to this fact  the company uses financial instruments  such as forward contracts  to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks associated with a portion of its investment in international operations 
in addition to hedging against the balance sheet impact of changes in exchange rates  the hedge of investments in international operations also has the effect of hedging a portion of cash flows from those operations 
the company also hedges with these instruments certain other exposures to various currencies arising from amounts payable and receivable  non permanent intercompany loans and forecasted purchases 
the company continuously monitors its foreign currency exposure and may enter into contracts to hedge exposure in see further discussion regarding the company s hedging activities in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is also exposed to rising material prices in its manufacturing operations and in particular the cost of oil and natural gas based resins 
this is the primary material used in production of tupperware products  and totaled about million in a percent fluctuation in the cost of resin could therefore impact the company s annual cost of sales in the million dollar range as compared with the prior year 
the company manages this risk by utilizing a centralized procurement function that is able to take advantage of bulk discounts while maintaining multiple suppliers and also enters into short term pricing arrangements 
it also manages its margin through the pricing of its products  with price increases generally in line with consumer inflation  and its mix of sales through its promotional programs and discount offers 
it may also  on occasion  make advance material purchases to take advantage of what it perceives to be favorable pricing 
at this point in time  the company has determined that entering forward contracts for resin prices is not cost beneficial and has no such contracts in place 
however  should circumstances warrant  the company may consider such contracts in the future 
the company s program to sell land held for development is also exposed to the risks inherent in the real estate development process
