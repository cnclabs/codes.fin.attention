if it is management s judgment that the selling price of an item must be lowered below its cost in order for it to be sold  then the carrying value of the related inventory is written down to estimated realizable sales value 
a number of factors would be taken into consideration in assessing realizable value including the quantity on hand  historical sales  technological advances  the existence of a replacement product  and consumer demand and preferences 
depending on market conditions  the actual amount received on sale could differ from management s estimate

these estimates range from things such as accrued bonuses to estimates of pending litigation claims and income taxes 
in establishing appropriate accruals  management must make judgments regarding the amount of the disbursement that will ultimately be incurred 
in making such assessments  management uses historical experience as well as any other special circumstances surrounding a particular item 
the actual amount paid could differ from management s estimate
