risk factors 
these risk factors may not be exhaustive 
we operate in a continually changing business environment  and new risk factors emerge from time to time

introduction selective insurance group  inc  selective  the company  we  or our offers property and casualty insurance products and diversified insurance services through its various subsidiaries 
selective classifies its businesses into three operating segments i insurance operations  ii investments  and iii diversified insurance services 
the purpose of the management s discussion and analysis md a is to provide an understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition and known trends and uncertainties that may have a material impact in future periods 
for convenience and reading ease  we have written the md a in the first person plural 
in the md a  we will discuss and analyze the following critical accounting policies and estimates  highlights of results for years ended december    and results of operations and related information by segment  financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources  federal income taxes  and adoption of accounting pronouncement 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates described below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of our operations 
our preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we consider our most significant accounting policies and estimates to be those applied to establish reserves for loss and loss expenses  deferred acquisition costs  pension and post retirement plan expenses  and other than temporary investment impairments 
reserves for losses and loss expenses significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss expenses  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and loss expenses 
as of december   the company had accrued billion of loss and loss expense reserves compared to billion at december  when a claim is reported to an insurance subsidiary  its claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices  as well as the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the case 
in accordance with industry practice  we maintain  in addition to case reserves  estimates of reserves for losses and loss expenses incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  we project our estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses at each reporting date 
the difference between i projected ultimate loss and loss expense reserves and ii case loss reserves and loss expense reserves thereon are carried as the ibnr reserve 
the actuarial techniques used are part of a comprehensive reserving process that includes two primary components 
the first component is a detailed quarterly reserve analysis performed by our internal actuarial staff 
in completing this analysis  the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions  including for example  the selection of loss development factors and the weight to be applied to each individual actuarial indication 
these indications include paid and incurred versions for the following methodologies loss development  bornhuetter ferguson  berquist sherman  and frequency severity 
additionally  the actuaries must gather substantially similar data in sufficient volume to ensure the statistical credibility of the data 
the second component of the analysis is the projection of the expected ultimate loss ratio for each line of business for the current accident year 
this projection is part of the company s planning process wherein the expected loss ratios are reviewed and updated each quarter 
this review includes actual versus expected pricing changes  loss trend assumptions  and updated prior period loss ratios from the most recent quarterly reserve analysis 
in addition to the most recent loss trends  a range of possible ibnr reserves is determined annually and continually considered  amongst other factors  in establishing ibnr for each reporting period 
loss trends include  but are not limited to large loss activity  environmental claim activity  large case reserve additions or reductions for prior accident years  and reinsurance recoverable issues 
the company also considers factors such as i per claim information  ii company and industry historical loss experience  iii legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and iv trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
based on the consideration of the range of possible ibnr reserves  recent loss trends and other factors  ibnr is established and the ultimate net liability for losses and loss expenses is determined 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment given that it is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until some time after the event 
even if a change is determined to be permanent  it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until some time later 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by many factors 
the changes in these estimates  resulting from the continuous review process and the differences between estimates and ultimate payments  are reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the period in which such estimates are changed 
any changes in the liability estimate may be material to the results of operations in future periods

such techniques assume that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  are an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
although this range reflects the most likely scenarios  it is possible that the final outcomes may fall above or below these amounts 
this range does not include a provision for potential increases or decreases associated with environmental reserves  as management believes it is not meaningful to calculate a range given the uncertainties associated with environmental claims 
the company does not discount to present value that portion of its loss reserves expected to be paid in future periods  however  the loss reserves include anticipated recoveries for salvage and subrogation claims 
in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels  the company reviews its reserve estimates on a regular basis as described above and makes adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustment is determined 
these reviews  from time to time  result in the company identifying information and trends that cause the company to increase some reserves and decrease other reserves for prior periods and could lead to the identification of a need for additional increases in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  which could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  equity  business  insurer financial strength and debt ratings 
the company experienced adverse development in its loss and loss expense reserves totaling million in  million in and million in for further discussion on the adverse development in loss and loss expense reserves  see the discussion on net loss and loss expense reserves in item business and note of
