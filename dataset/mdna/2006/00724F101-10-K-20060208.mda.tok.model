acquisition of macromedia on december   we completed the acquisition of macromedia for approximately billion 
we expect the acquisition to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we expect our revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses to increase in the future  but we also anticipate cost saving synergies 
in addition  we expect to incur estimated restructuring charges of million to million in the next fiscal year  primarily in the first quarter 
coinciding with the integration of macromedia and the start of our fiscal year  we changed the reporting of our principal business segments to be aligned with our market opportunities and how we manage our various businesses 
the discussions in this section of the annual report on form k  as well as the financial statements contained herein  relate to adobe as a standalone entity and do not reflect the impact of the acquisition

our software runs on microsoft windows  apple os  linux  unix and various non personal computer platforms  depending on the product 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  see the discussion in the section titled recent accounting pronouncements below and note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current us generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and are subject to change 
our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently and which portions  if any  must be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services 
our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services could differ from actual events  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
we have to estimate provisions for returns which are recorded against our revenues 
in determining our estimate for returns  and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue  we rely upon historical data  the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel  the rate at which our product sells through to the end user  product plans and other factors 
our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs 
more or less product may be returned from what was estimated 
the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated 
our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs 
there could be a delay in the release of our products 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards revised sfas r  share based payment which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of income 
in april  the sec announced that the accounting provisions of sfas r are to be applied in the first quarter of the fiscal year beginning after june  as a result  we are now required to adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal and will recognize stock based compensation expense using the modified prospective method 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for the pro forma net income and net income per share amounts as if we had used a fair value based method similar to the methods required under sfas r to measure compensation expense for employee stock incentive awards 
we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r and expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our consolidated statements of income and net income per share 
see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding other recent accounting pronouncements 
results of operations overview of during fiscal  we continued to focus on delivering comprehensive technology platforms to our customers to drive revenue and earnings growth 
in our intelligent document business  we achieved year over year growth primarily due to our acrobat family of products which began shipping in the first quarter 
acrobat has numerous new features to help drive increased adoption by users in enterprises  governments and specialized vertical markets such as architecture  engineering and construction 
we also achieved year over year growth in our creative professional business due primarily to the release of version of our adobe creative suite products beginning in the second quarter of the fiscal year 
creative suite integrates new full versions of adobe s design and publishing software  along with version cue cs and a new visual file browser called adobe bridge 
beginning in fiscal  many customers began licensing photoshop capabilities via the creative suite products  as opposed to licensing the standalone version of the product 
this planned migration has impacted the revenues from our digital imaging and video business segment 
however  our total revenue in the digital imaging and video business grew in fiscal due to the strength of our adobe photoshop elements and adobe premiere elements software bundle  new versions of which were released in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenue fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal product    percentage of total revenues services and support percentage of total revenues total revenues    in fiscal  we had four reportable segments digital imaging and video  creative professional  intelligent document  and oem postscript and other 
the digital imaging and video segment provides users with software for creating  editing  enhancing and sharing digital images and photographs  digital video  audio and animations 
the creative professional segment provides software for professional page layout  professional web page layout  graphic and illustration creation  technical document publishing and business publishing 
additionally  this segment includes photoshop and acrobat professional as part of its adobe creative suite products 
the intelligent document segment provides electronic document distribution software that allows users to create  enhance  annotate and securely send adobe pdf files that can be shared  viewed  navigated and printed exactly as intended on a broad range of hardware and software platforms

the oem postscript and other segment includes printing technology used to create and print simple or visually rich documents with precision 
our services and support revenue is composed of professional services such as consulting services and training and maintenance and support  primarily related to the licensing of our intelligent document server solution products 
our support revenue also includes technical support and developer support to partners and developer organizations related to our desktop products 
our professional services revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method and is measured monthly based on input measures  such as hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete  with consideration given to output measures  such as contract milestones  when applicable 
our maintenance and support offerings  which entitle customers to receive product upgrades and enhancements or technical support  depending on the offering  are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
segment information fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal digital imaging and video percentage of total revenues creative professional percentage of total revenues intelligent document percentage of total revenues oem postscript and other percentage of total revenues total revenues    beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year with the completion of our acquisition of macromedia  we changed the reporting of our business segments to be aligned with our market opportunities and how we manage our combined businesses 
our new business segments are creative solutions  knowledge worker solutions  enterprise and developer solutions  mobile and device solutions  and other 
the management discussion and analysis that follows is based on the segment reporting that was in effect throughout fiscal fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue revenue from our digital imaging and video segment grew slightly for fiscal as compared to fiscal the growth in the segment was due to the increase in revenues from our digital imaging software products as a result of new releases of our adobe photoshop elements product as well as the new software bundle that combines our adobe photoshop elements and adobe premiere elements products 
revenue from our creative professional segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a increase in revenues from the new versions of our adobe creative suite products which were released during the second quarter of fiscal there were no notable decreases for fiscal revenue from our intelligent document segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a increase in revenues from our acrobat desktop products 
the increase in revenues from our acrobat desktop products is due to continued adoption of acrobat desktop products by enterprises and technical professionals  as well as the release of acrobat during the first quarter of fiscal revenue from our intelligent document livecycle products increased approximately during fiscal due to increased licensing and server support revenue  as we continue to focus on both the government sector and financial services 
additionally  revenue from our intelligent document segment increased during fiscal due to an increase in consulting revenues 
there were no notable decreases for fiscal revenue from our oem postscript and other segment remained relatively flat during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from this segment has declined over the last few years and we expect this trend to continue 
fiscal revenue compared to fiscal revenue revenue from our digital imaging and video segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to increases in revenues from both our digital video and digital imaging software products 
revenue from our digital video software products increased during fiscal which was attributable to new releases during fiscal revenue from our digital imaging software products increased during fiscal due to continued success with adobe photoshop cs which was released at the end of fiscal as well as the release of photoshop elements in fiscal revenue from our creative professional segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the continued strength of our adobe creative suite products which were initially released in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in revenues from our adobe creative suite products were partially offset by decreases in revenues in our business and technical page layout software products due to product lifecycle timing 
revenue from our intelligent document segment increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a increase in revenues from our acrobat desktop products as a result of continued adoption of acrobat desktop products launched in fiscal additionally  revenue from our intelligent document server based products increased due to increased licensing and server support revenue 
revenue from our oem postscript and other segment decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a decline in pricing resulting from competition from clone postscript technologies and lower prices of output devices 
geographic information fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal americas percentage of total revenues emea percentage of total revenues asia percentage of total revenues total revenues    revenue in the americas increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the strength of our digital imaging and video  creative professional and intelligent document products 
revenue in emea and asia increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the strength of our creative professional and intelligent document products 
the increase in revenues  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  in each of our geographic segments was primarily due to the strength of our creative professional products 
additionally  due to the strength of the euro and the yen  revenues in emea and asia increased approximately million and million  respectively  during fiscal over fiscal and increased million and million  respectively  during fiscal over fiscal platform information fiscal fiscal fiscal windows macintosh we expect a growth trend towards the windows platform over the long term due to our targeting of business users with our intelligent document desktop products  where the majority of users run the windows operating system 
inventory information at the end of fiscal our overall channel inventory position was within our global inventory policy which allows  on an overall basis  up to weeks of anticipated total product supply at our distributors 
with regard to our product backlog  our experience is that the actual amount of backlog at any particular time may not be a meaningful indicator of future business prospects 
for example  prior to the finalization and release of new products  we may have significant levels of orders for new product releases 
our backlog of unfulfilled orders at the end of fiscal  other than those associated with new product releases  those pending credit review and those due to the application of our global channel inventory policy  was approximately of fourth quarter fiscal revenue 
the comparable backlog at the end of third quarter of fiscal was approximately of third quarter fiscal revenue 
cost of revenues fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal product percentage of total revenues services and support percentage of total revenues total cost of revenues product cost of product revenue includes product packaging  third party royalties  excess and obsolete inventory  amortization related to localization costs and acquired technologies and the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products 
cost of product revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to material costs related to higher shrink wrap revenue  due to an increase in our localization costs related to our product launches  related to royalties for licensed technologies  related to excess and obsolete inventory and other expenses 
these increases were partially offset by an decrease in cost of product revenue due to a one time charge related to a litigation settlement that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal the remaining increase in cost of product revenue for fiscal was due to various individually insignificant items 
cost of product revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to licensing costs as a result of litigation settlements that occurred in fiscal and an increase in localization costs related to our product launches 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in overall material costs 
services and support cost of services and support revenue is composed primarily of employee related costs and related costs incurred to provide consulting services  training and product support 
cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to increases in headcount related expenses  including higher compensation and related benefits  as well as outsourced consulting fees 
cost of services and support revenue increased during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to costs associated with our expert support program that was initiated during the second quarter of fiscal additionally  cost of services and support revenue increased due to compensation and related benefits as a result of higher headcount and incentive compensation related to increases in services and support activities in fiscal operating expenses research and development fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal expenses percentage of total revenues research and development expenses consist of salary and benefit expenses for software developers  contracted development efforts  related facilities costs and expenses associated with computer equipment used in software development 
research and development expenses fluctuated due to the following change to change to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation increased use of contractors increased purchases of equipment and software licenses various individually insignificant items total change we believe that investments in research and development  including the recruiting and hiring of software developers  are critical to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to continued timely development of new and enhanced products

general and administrative expenses fluctuated due to the following change to change to compensation and related benefits associated with headcount growth and higher incentive compensation increased professional fees increased depreciation and amortization increased repairs and maintenance decreased legal fees various individually insignificant items total change restructuring and other charges fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal expenses percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful 
we did not incur any restructuring and other charges in fiscal and during fiscal  we revised our estimates of certain costs associated with our restructuring program that was implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we revised the accrual related to severance and other charges and facilities 
non operating income fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal investment gain loss percentage of total revenues interest and other income percentage of total revenues total non operating income percentage is not meaningful 
investment gain loss investment gain loss consists principally of realized gains or losses from the sale of marketable equity investments  other than temporary declines in the value of marketable and non marketable equity securities  and gains and losses of adobe ventures 
net losses related to our investments in adobe ventures and cost method investments write downs due to other than temporary declines in value of our marketable equity securities gains from sale of short term investments gains on stock warrants total investment gain loss we are uncertain of future investment gains or losses as they are primarily dependent upon market conditions and the operations of the underlying investee companies 
interest and other income the largest component of interest and other income is interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term fixed income investments  but also includes gains and losses on the sale of fixed income investments  foreign exchange transactions including hedging gains and losses  and interest expense 
interest and other income increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to higher interest income as a result of higher levels of cash and higher interest rates during fiscal  as well as higher gains on our foreign currency hedging program 
interest and other income increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher levels of cash during fiscal income tax provision fiscal change to fiscal change to fiscal provision percentage of total revenues effective tax rate our effective tax rate decreased percentage points during fiscal as compared to fiscal due to a million tax benefit recognized for the repatriation of certain foreign earnings under fasb staff position no

see note in our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding fas the net tax benefit includes a million reversal for taxes on foreign earnings for which a deferred tax liability had been previously accrued 
in addition  our effective tax rate decreased percentage point due to a variety of factors  including higher profits earned by our international trading company which are taxed at a lower statutory rate and a reduction of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to higher profits earned by our international trading company which are taxed at a lower statutory rate

the primary uses of cash are payroll salaries  bonuses  and benefits  general operating expenses marketing  travel  office rent and cost of product revenue 
another source of cash is proceeds from the exercise of employee options and another use of cash is our stock repurchase program  which is detailed below 
in fiscal  we reclassified all auction rate securities and variable rate demand obligations to short term investments pursuant to an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  statement of cash flows relating to the definition of cash equivalents 
this interpretation and subsequent reclassification has resulted in a presentation of our consolidated balance sheet that may understate the true liquidity of our fixed income portfolio 
as of december   million of the securities now classified as short term investments have structural features that allow us to sell the securities at par within days and thus retain similar liquidity characteristics as cash equivalents 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  of million  primarily comprised net income  net of non cash related expenses 
working capital sources of cash were increases in accrued expenses  income taxes payable and deferred revenue 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to compensation related costs and marketing expenses 
income taxes payable increased as a result of higher current tax liabilities related to repatriation of certain foreign earnings and overall increased taxable income 
deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations 
working capital uses of cash included increases in trade receivables and other current assets 
our accounts receivable increased due to higher revenue during the period 
as compared to fiscal  our days sales outstanding in trade receivables dso was days  one day higher than fiscal other current assets increased due to an increase in prepaid expenses primarily related to acquisition costs 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  of  million primarily comprised net income  net of non cash related expenses 
working capital sources of cash were increases in accrued expenses  deferred revenue and a decrease in accounts receivable 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to compensation related costs 
deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance and support obligations 
our accounts receivable decreased due to increased levels of cash collections 
our trade dso decreased from days at november  to days at december  working capital uses of cash included a decrease in income taxes payable due to tax payments made for both agreed and disputed tax assessments 
cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  of million  primarily comprised net income  net of non cash related expenses  and increases in accrued expenses  income taxes payable and deferred revenue 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to incentive compensation related costs  sales and marketing programs  legal fees and accruals for major product releases 
income taxes payable increased due to an increase in taxable income 
deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased maintenance obligations 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in receivables at the end of the year and a decrease in accrued restructuring charges 
the increase in receivables was primarily due to the increase in revenues during the year and the launch of our new creative suites and related cs products at the end of the year 
the decrease in accrued restructuring is primarily due to the payments of severance and facility costs 
net cash used for investing activities in fiscal of million decreased from net cash used in fiscal of million because there was not an investment in a lease receivable related to our corporate headquarter office buildings in as there was in this was partially offset by higher net purchases of short term investments in fiscal net cash used for investing activities in fiscal decreased from net cash used in fiscal of million due primarily to lower net purchases of short term investments in fiscal cash used for financing activities in fiscal of million increased from cash used in fiscal of million primarily due to a decrease in proceeds received from the re issuance of treasury stock as a result of a lower number of options being exercised 
cash used for financing activities in fiscal increased from the cash provided in fiscal of million primarily due to repurchases of stock 
cash used for stock repurchases during fiscal increased from fiscal due to a higher average cost per share  a higher number of shares being repurchased and remaining prepayments related to stock repurchase agreements see the section titled stock repurchase program i on going dilution 
we discontinued our quarterly cash dividend after the payment of the dividend for the first quarter of fiscal we intend to use the cash previously used to pay the quarterly dividend for our ongoing stock repurchase programs 
under the terms of our lease agreements for our san jose headquarters  we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless an event of default occurs 
we expect to continue our investing activities  including investments in short term and long term investments and purchases of computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  product support  and administrative staff 
furthermore  cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase programs and strategically acquire software companies  products or technologies that are complementary to our business 
adobe uses professional investment management firms to manage most of our invested cash 
external investment firms managed  on average  of adobe s invested balances during fiscal within the us  the fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in municipal bonds 
outside of the us  our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in us treasury notes and other sovereign obligations  and highly rated corporate notes 
the balance of the fixed income portfolio is managed internally and invested primarily in money market funds for working capital purposes 
all investments are made according to policies approved by the board of directors 
during fiscal  we completed our evaluation of the repatriation provisions of the ajca and repatriated million of certain foreign earnings 
the effect of the repatriation was to increase liquidity in the united states with a corresponding reduction in liquidity in foreign subsidiaries 
we expect that our foreign subsidiaries will have sufficient positive cash flow from operations to meet ongoing liquidity needs over the next months 
further information regarding the tax effects of the ajca can be found in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances may decline during fiscal in the event of a weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay 
however  based on our current business plan and revenue prospects  we believe that our existing balances together with our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to the risks detailed in the section entitled business risk factors 
also  while we currently have no committed lines of credit  we believe that our banking relationships and good credit should afford us the opportunity to raise sufficient debt in the bank or public market  if required 
acquisition of macromedia on december   we completed the acquisition of macromedia  inc for approximately billion 
under the terms of the agreement  which was approved by the boards of directors and the stockholders of both companies  macromedia stockholders received  at a fixed exchange ratio  shares of adobe common stock for every share of macromedia common stock in a tax free exchange 
this fixed exchange ratio gives effect to the two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend paid on may  to the stockholders of adobe 
we expect to incur significant incremental costs  such as direct costs related to the acquisition and costs associated with restructuring our operations 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet these cash outlays 
stock repurchase program i on going dilution coverage to facilitate our stock repurchase program  designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances  we repurchase shares in the open market and from time to time enter into structured stock repurchase agreements with third parties 
authorization to repurchase shares to cover on going dilution is not subject to expiration 
however  this repurchase program is limited to covering net dilution from stock issuances and is subject to business conditions and cash flow requirements as determined by our board of directors from time to time 
refer to part ii  item c in this report for share repurchases during the quarter ended december  during fiscal  we entered into several structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions 
under these agreements  we provided the financial institutions with up front payments totaling million 
the financial institutions agreed to deliver to us  at certain intervals during the contract term  a certain number of our shares based on the volume weighted average price during such intervals less a specified discount 
upon payment  the million was classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet 
as of december   approximately million of the up front payments remained under the agreements which expired on december  on april   the board of directors approved the use of billion for stock repurchase commencing upon the close of the macromedia acquisition 
at the beginning of our fiscal  we entered into additional structured stock repurchase agreements with large financial institutions 
under these agreements  we provided the financial institutions with up front payments totaling million 
the financial institutions agreed to deliver to us  at certain intervals during the contract term  a certain number of shares based on the volume weighted average price during such intervals less a specified discount 
the million will be classified as treasury stock on our balance sheet

off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations our principal commitments as of december   consist of obligations under operating leases  royalty agreements and various service agreements 
we expect to fulfill all of the following commitments from our working capital 
lease commitments the two lease agreements discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements are subject to standard financial covenants 
as of december  we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
we expect to remain within compliance in the next months 
we are comfortable with these limitations and believe they will not impact our credit or cash in the coming year or restrict our ability to execute our business plan 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our lease commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  total less than year years years over years non cancelable operating leases  net of sublease income indemnifications in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future results of operations 
to the extent permitted under delaware law  we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements in excess of applicable insurance coverage is minimal 
as part of our limited partnership interests in adobe ventures  we have provided a general indemnification to granite ventures  an independent venture capital firm and sole general partner of adobe ventures  for certain events or occurrences while granite ventures is  or was serving  at our request in such capacity provided that granite ventures acts in good faith on behalf of the partnerships 
we are unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments that could potentially result from any hypothetical future claim  but believe the risk of having to make any payments under this general indemnification to be remote 
royalties we have certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue and are not included in the table above 
royalty expense  which was recorded under our cost of products revenue on our consolidated statements of income  was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
certain royalty commitments have minimum commitment obligations  however  as of december  all such obligations were immaterial 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in foreign countries  in us dollars and in various foreign currencies 
in europe and japan  transactions that are denominated in euro or yen subject us to exposure from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to yen denominated product and support revenue in japan and euro denominated product and support revenue in certain european countries 
in fiscal  and  our revenue exposures were billion yen  billion yen and billion yen  respectively 
in fiscal  and  our revenue exposures were million euros  million euros and million euros  respectively 
our japanese operating expenses are in yen and our european operating expenses are primarily in euro  which mitigates a portion of the exposure related to yen and euro denominated product revenue 
in addition  we hedge firmly committed transactions using forward contracts 
these contracts do subject us to risk of accounting gains and losses  however  the gains and losses on these contracts largely offset gains and losses on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
we also hedge a percentage of forecasted international revenue with forward and purchased option contracts 
our revenue hedging policy is intended to reduce the negative impact on our forecasted revenue due to foreign currency exchange rate movements 
at december   total outstanding contracts were million which included the notional equivalent of million in foreign currency forward exchange contracts which hedged our balance sheet exposures and the notional equivalent of million in put option contracts which hedged our forecasted revenue 
as of december   all contracts were set to expire at various times through april the bank counterparties in these contracts expose us to credit related losses in the event of their nonperformance 
however  to mitigate that risk we only contract with counterparties with specific minimum rating requirements 
in addition  our hedging policy establishes maximum limits for each counterparty 
in addition we also have long term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non usd functional currency foreign subsidiaries 
for the fiscal years ending december  and december  this long term investment exposure totaled a notional equivalent of million and million  respectively 
at this time we do not hedge these long term investment exposures 
economic hedging hedges of forecasted transactions we use option foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain operational cash flow exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these foreign exchange contracts  carried at fair value  may have maturities between one and twelve months 
such cash flow exposures result from portions of our forecasted revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
we enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted product licensing revenue in the normal course of business  and accordingly  they are not speculative in nature 
we record changes in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  until the forecasted transaction occurs 
when the forecasted transaction occurs  we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue 
in the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur  or it becomes probable that it will not occur  we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to interest and other income loss on the consolidated statement of income at that time 
for the fiscal year ended december   there were no such net gains or losses recognized in other income relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur 
see also note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
balance sheet hedging hedging of foreign currency assets and liabilities we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as other income loss 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
at december   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a and shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
for option contracts  the black scholes equation model was used 
for forward contracts  duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes are made to the spot rates of the currency 
a and increase in the value of the us dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a and decrease in the value of the us dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by million and million  respectively 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as a general rule  we do not use financial instruments to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists 
for example  in many countries revenue from the local currency product licenses substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures  primarily related to operating expenses  on an ongoing basis 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program

equity investments we are exposed to equity price risk on our portfolio of marketable equity securities 
as of december   our total equity holdings in publicly traded companies were valued at million compared to million at december   a decrease of 
the decrease was due to sales of million and million write downs due to an other than temporary decline in value of our marketable equity securities offset by an increase of in market value adjustments 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that the fair values of these securities could adversely change in the near term 
we have a policy in place to review our equity holdings on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each company s cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance over the past six months  liquidity and management ownership 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline in value exists in one of our marketable equity securities  it is our policy to write down these equity investments to the market value and record the related write down in our consolidated statements of income 
the following table represents the potential decrease in fair values of our marketable equity securities that are sensitive to changes in the stock market 
fair value deteriorations of  and were selected based on the probability of their occurrence 
marketable equity securities fixed income investments at december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents  of  million compared to  million at december   an increase of 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our fixed income investments 
the table below separates the remaining maturities of our fixed income securities into segments  based on stated maturities  to show the approximate exposure to interest rates 
a significant proportion of securities classified as due after three years  based on the stated maturity  have structural features that allow us to sell the securities  at par  in less than three years 
due within one year due within two years due within three years due after three years total  a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over six month and twelve month time horizons 
the following table represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
month horizon month horizon we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
our investment policy limits the maximum weighted average duration of all invested funds to years 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one security issue  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
privately held investments we have direct investments  as well as indirect investments through adobe ventures  in several privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky  as the technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize  and we could lose a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies 
it is our policy to review privately held investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying amount and economic viability of these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us publicly traded companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies
