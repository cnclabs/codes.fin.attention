overview we are a biopharmaceutical company committed to the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule medicines for the treatment of hepatitis  other serious infections and cancer 
our current clinical development programs include ana  an oral prodrug of isatoribine for the treatment of hepatitis c virus hcv and hepatitis b virus hbv  which we are co developing with novartis international pharmaceutical ltd  a novartis ag company novartis  and ana for the treatment of hbv  which we are co developing with lg life sciences lgls 
in december we selected ana  a novel toll like receptor tlr oral prodrug  for our next clinical development program 
we are independently developing ana as an oral therapy for the treatment of certain cancers and plan to initiate clinical trials for ana in the second half of our therapeutic focus in hepatitis  other serious infections and cancer leverages our core capabilities in toll like receptor tlr based small molecules and structure based drug design  and is aimed to advance a balanced and strong pipeline of drug candidates into the clinic 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and  as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for at least the next several years as we fund our portion of the development of ana for the treatment of hcv and hbv  fund our portion of the global development costs of ana  continue the development of our other product candidates  including ana  advance our preclinical candidates into clinical development  develop and scale up product candidates for clinical trials and potential commercialization  further our research and development programs  establish a commercial infrastructure  commercialize any product candidates that receive regulatory approval  and potentially in license technology and acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that are synergistic with our own 
research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the discovery and preclinical and clinical development of our lead product candidates  ana  ana and ana  and our other product candidates 
research and 
table of contents development expenses include direct external costs such as fees paid to consultants  joint development collaboration costs and related contract research  and internal direct and indirect costs such as compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies and materials  facility costs and depreciation 
to the extent that costs are not tracked to a specific project  they are included as unallocated direct internal costs and unallocated indirect internal costs and overhead in the table below 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
the following summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and for the years ended december  in thousands direct external costs isatoribine family of compounds  excluding ana ana ana ana other unallocated direct internal costs unallocated indirect internal costs and overhead reimbursement of ana costs by novartis total research and development under our existing collaboration with novartis for the development of ana  novartis will fund of the development costs and we will fund of such development costs 
reimbursement of development costs for ana from novartis are recorded as an offset to research and development expense 
payments to novartis for its portion of development costs for ana will be recorded as a component of research and development expense 
for the year ended december   we have recorded as an offset to research and development expense million which represents novartis share of ana expenses incurred by us from june  through december  as we progress through the development plan for ana  more responsibility for the clinical trials will transition from us to novartis  with reimbursement for research and development expenditures then flowing from us to novartis 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our lead compounds  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
however  we expect our research and development costs to be substantial and to increase as we move other product candidates into preclinical and clinical trials and advance our existing product candidates into later stages of development 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we are currently focused primarily on advancing the development of ana as a potential frontline therapy for hcv and hbv  ana as a potential oral therapy for the treatment of certain cancers and ana as a potential therapy of hbv 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for administrative  finance  investor relations  business development  human resources and legal personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include insurance costs  professional services and an allocated portion of facilities costs and information systems support personnel 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or gaap 
the preparation of these 
table of contents financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while all of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies involve the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we may receive payments from collaborators for compound licenses  technology access fees  option fees  research services  milestones and royalty obligations 
these payments are recognized as revenue or reported as deferred revenue until they meet the criteria for revenue recognition as outlined in staff accounting bulletin sab  no 
 revenue recognition  which provides guidance on revenue recognition in financial statements  and is based on the interpretations and practices developed by the sec  and emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services were rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
specifically  we have applied the following policies in recognizing revenue revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgment from the collaborator or other persuasive evidence that the milestone has been achieved  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by the collaborator at the comparable level and iii the milestone is not refundable or creditable 
if all of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
upfront fees under our collaborations  such as technology access fees  are recognized over the period the related services are provided 
non refundable upfront fees not associated with our future performance are recognized when received 
fees that we receive for research services are generally recognized as the services are provided  as long as the amounts received are not refundable regardless of the results of the research project 
research services may include agreements through which we will deploy our internal capabilities to assist a collaborator to advance their target  such as our medicinal chemistry and screening capabilities 
drug development costs 
we review and accrue drug development costs based on work performed  which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on subject enrollment  estimated timeline for completion of studies and other events 
these costs and estimates vary based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial and the length of dose period for each subject as well as other factors 
drug development costs are subject to revisions as trials and studies progress to completion 
expense is adjusted for revisions in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which we receive employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method that we currently use and requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expense in our statement of operations 
the effective date of the standard is for annual periods beginning after june  accordingly  we adopted sfas r on january  the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to result in non cash compensation expense that will reduce the company s net loss per share by approximately to per share for however  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense is affected by changes in the company s stock price  the number of stock based awards granted in  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation assumptions 
these valuation assumptions include  but are not limited to  the volatility of the company s stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors 

table of contents results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and revenue 
we recorded revenues of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase from to was primarily attributed to revenues derived from our collaborations with novartis and roche 
during  we recorded revenues of million associated with the amortization of our million up front payment and million ind milestone payment from novartis 
the up front payment and the ind milestone payment are both being amortized over the estimated development period for ana the  decrease from to was primarily attributable to revenues derived from our collaborations with roche and amgen in compared to fluctuations in our collaboration related revenue from period to period are expected  as amounts recognized are dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to  the timing of agreements  the timing of the workflow under the agreements  our collaborators abilities to provide us with the materials and information necessary for us to conduct our portion of the collaboration effort and the occurance of events that may trigger milestone payments to us 
we expect our revenues to continue to fluctuate in future periods as we continue to enter into new agreements and perform activities under existing agreements 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease from to was primarily attributable to the recording of million as an offset to research and development expense  which represents an estimate of novartis share of ana expenses incurred by us from june  through december  this decrease was offset by increased costs associated with the development of ana  including clinical trial costs and costs associated with compound manufacturing and safety studies as well as research and development expenses associated with other programs 
the million increase from to was primarily a result of the following i the  option payment and the million licensing fee paid to lgls in conjunction with the execution of our joint development and license agreement and ii an increase in drug development expenses of million related to drug development costs associated with the continued development of our isatoribine family of compounds and joint drug development costs associated with ana general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the  increase from to was primarily the result of the following i an increase in personnel and recruiting expenses of  ii an increase in consultant costs associated with the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act and iii an increase in our directors and officers insurance premium as a result of our initial public offering which was completed in march the million increase from to was primarily the result of the following i moving expenses associated with our relocation of our corporate headquarters in june  ii increases in legal expenses associated with the filing of patent applications and other legal costs associated with the on going operations of the company and iii increases in costs as a result of being a public company including directors and officers insurance premiums  accounting fees and investor and public relations expenses 
stock based compensation 
deferred compensation for stock options and stock awards granted has been determined as the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
options or awards issued to non employees are recorded at their fair value in accordance with sfas no 
and periodically remeasured in accordance with eitf and recognized over the service period 
in conjunction with our initial public offering  we reviewed our historical exercise prices through march  and  as a result  revised our estimate for financial reporting purposes of fair value for stock options granted subsequent to july  through the date of our initial public offering 
with respect to these options  we recorded deferred stock based compensation for the difference between the original exercise price per share determined by the board of directors and our revised estimate of fair value per share at the respective grant dates 
we recorded these amounts as a component of stockholders equity and are amortizing these amounts  on an accelerated basis  as a non cash charge to operations over the vesting period of the options 
as a result  we recorded stock based compensation of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest income 
interest income was million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in our interest income from to was the result of the receipt of the following amounts which were invested into interest bearing securities during an up front license payment of million from novartis in july  million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs  from our follow on public offering of common stock in august and a million milestone payment from novartis triggered by the acceptance of our ind application 
table of contents by the fda received in september our average balance of cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale  which were invested in interest bearing securities  was million in compared to million in the  increase from to was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income due to our higher average cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale balances as a result of the receipt of the proceeds from our initial public offering during april and may interest expense 
interest expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest expense for the years ended december   and was relatively consistent 
other  net 
other  net was an expense of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the fluctuation in other  net for the years ended december   and was primarily the result of the loss on the disposal of assets and due to the substantial dissolution of our german subsidiary in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and securities available for sale of million 
during  we have funded our operations and increased our cash reserves through the sale of common stock and payments received pursuant to our collaboration agreement with novartis 
on august   we completed a public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock  including  shares issued upon the exercise of an option granted to the underwriters to cover over allotments  at a public offering price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs 
during july  we received from novartis an upfront payment of million  and in september received a million milestone payment triggered by the acceptance of our ind application with the fda for ana during  we primarily funded our operations through our initial public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock  including  shares issued upon the exercise of an option granted to the underwriters to cover over allotments  at a public offering price of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs 
cash flows from operating activities and investing activities our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows for the years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities purchase of securities available for sale proceeds from sale of securities available for sale purchase of property and equipment proceeds from disposal of property and equipment acquisition of facility leasehold improvements from lease incentive net cash provided by used in investing activities cash flows provided by used in operating activities increased by million from to the increase was primarily a result of an increase in deferred revenue attributable to the receipt of the up front license payment of million from novartis in july and the receipt in september of a million milestone payment from novartis triggered by the acceptance of our ind application by the fda 
the up front license payment of million and the million ind milestone payment are being recognized as revenue over the estimated development period for ana as of december   we have recorded million of deferred revenue related to these two payments 
the increase in deferred revenue was offset by our million net operating loss for the year ended december  
table of contents cash flows used in operating activities increased by million from to the key component of this increase was our increased net loss from to of million 
the following items also significantly impacted our cash flows used in operating activities amortization of deferred compensation from employee stock options increased million from million during compared to million during during  we received million in lease incentives as a result of entering into a lease for our new corporate headquarters and research and development facility 
in addition  we paid million for a refundable security deposit on this facility 
cash flows provided by used in investing activities increased by million from to the increase was primarily the result of the investment in securities available for sale of million from our initial public offering during the year ended december  offset by the use of the proceeds from our initial public offering and maturity of securities available for sale during the year ended december  to fund our on going operations 
cash flows provided by used in investing activities decreased by million from to the key component in this decrease was the use of our excess proceeds from our initial public offering during for the purchase of marketable securities whereas during we used proceeds from the sale of marketable securities to fund operations 
the following items also significantly impacted our cash flows from investing activities we purchased property  equipment  and facility leasehold improvements in the amount of  which related primarily to research and development equipment 
during  we utilized million of lease incentives to fund the construction of certain tenant improvements to prepare our new corporate headquarters and research and development facility for occupancy 
cash flows from financing activities our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows for the years ended december  in thousands cash provided by financing activities proceeds from exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan proceeds from sale of common stock  net of issuance costs proceeds from sale of preferred stock  net of issuance costs proceeds from long term debt principal payments on long term debt net cash provided by financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million from to the increase was primarily a result of the receipt of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs from our follow on public offering of common stock completed during august  as compared to the receipt of million from our initial public offering completed during march and april cash flows provided by financing activities increased by million from to the key component in this increase was the proceeds from our initial public offering of million during the following items also significantly impacted our cash flows provided by financing activities during  we received proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and from our employee stock purchase plan of  
table of contents during  we modified our existing loan and security agreement and as a result increased the maximum amount available under the agreement to million  provided for a revolving credit facility and extended the availability of the credit facility to december  during  we executed promissory notes under the loan and security agreement in the amount of million for eligible equipment and tenant improvements 
aggregate contractual obligations the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands less than to to contractual obligations total year thereafter operating leases equipment financing minimum royalty commitment during february  we paid the outstanding principal due on all of the equipment financing loans and as a result the entire outstanding balance is being reported as due in fiscal year we also enter into agreements with clinical sites and contract research organizations that conduct our clinical trials 
we generally make payments to these entities based upon the number of subjects enrolled and the length of their participation in the trials 
to date  the majority of our clinical costs have been related to the costs of subjects entering our clinical trials as well as the manufacturing of compounds to be used in our clinical trials 
costs associated with clinical trials will continue to vary as the trials go through their natural phases of enrollment and follow up 
our portion of the costs will also be influenced by the pace and timing of the development activities conducted under our joint development agreements with our collaborators  including novartis and lgls 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the total costs we will incur in the continued development of our clinical candidates for potential commercialization 
due to these same factors  we are unable to determine the anticipated completion dates for our current product development programs 
clinical development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
as we continue our discovery  pre clinical and clinical programs  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment of the product candidate s commercial potential 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which currently un partnered product candidates will be subject to future partnering  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
as a result  we cannot be certain when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our drug candidates 
we expect our development expenses to be substantial and to increase as we continue the advancement of our development programs 
the lengthy process of completing clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or delay in completing clinical trials  or in obtaining regulatory approvals  could cause our research and development expenses to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
overview of financial position and future cash requirements our consolidated balance sheet as of december   compared to our consolidated balance sheet as of december   was primarily impacted by the increase in cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale of million which represents the receipt of funds from the following events the receipt of an up front license payment of million from novartis in july  the receipt of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs  from our follow on public offering of common stock in august  and the receipt of a million milestone payment from novartis in september triggered by the acceptance of our ind application by the fda 
as of december   we have recorded million of deferred revenue related to the two novartis payments 

table of contents our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the progress of our clinical trials  the progress of our research activities  the number and scope of our research programs  the progress of our preclinical development activities  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the pace and timing of development activities conducted under joint development agreements with our collaborators  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing or expanding manufacturing  sales and distribution capabilities  the costs related to development and manufacture of pre clinical  clinical and validation lots for regulatory and commercialization of drug supply  the success of the commercialization of ana  ana  ana or any other product candidates we may develop  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses 
as a component of research and development expense  we have recorded our share of ana development expenses incurred by lgls  net of lgls s portion of our costs incurred during the year ended december  we estimate our share of joint development costs based on information provided to us by lgls and based upon the current development plan for ana in connection with the execution of the agreement  we paid a licensing fee of million during may to lgls 
in addition  we may be required to make additional milestone payments totalling up to million  subject to the attainment of product development and commercialization objectives 
we will pay royalties on any product sales in our sales territory to lgls and will receive royalties on any product sales in china from lgls 
on june   we entered into a license and co development agreement with novartis  for the development and potential commercialization of ana and potentially additional toll like receptor tlr oral prodrugs for chronic hcv and hbv infections  as well as other potential infectious disease indications 
under the collaboration agreement  the parties will collaborate to develop one or more isatoribine prodrugs or other tlr compounds for the treatment of hcv and hbv 
under the collaboration  we may receive up to million for the achievement of specified development  regulatory and sales milestones 
there is no guarantee we will receive any milestone payments under the agreement 
under the collaboration agreement  novartis will fund of the global development costs of the lead product candidate  and we will fund of such development costs  subject to certain limitations 
during the year ended december   we have recorded million as an offset to research and development expense  which represents an estimate of novartis share of ana expenses incurred by us from june  through december  as of december   the million due from novartis was recorded as a component of our accounts receivable 
as we progress through the development plan for ana  more responsibility for the clinical trials will transition from us to novartis with reimbursement for research and development expenditures then flowing from us to novartis 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and securities available for sale and revenues we may generate from our current collaborations will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at least the next fiscal year 
we expect to incur substantial expenses for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and funding that we expect to receive from collaborators will enable us to maintain our 
table of contents currently planned operations for at least the next fiscal year 
changes to our current operating plan may require us to consume available capital resources significantly sooner than we expect 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities and cash receipts from collaboration agreements 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and securities available for sale resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties other than what is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
