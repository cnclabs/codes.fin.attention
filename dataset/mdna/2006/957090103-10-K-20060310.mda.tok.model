item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion addresses information pertaining to the financial condition and results of operations of westamerica bancorporation and subsidiaries the company that may not be otherwise apparent from a review of the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
it should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes found on pages through  as well as with the other information presented throughout the report 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make certain estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the allowance for loan losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the amount of loss in the loan portfolio that can be reasonably estimated as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  uncertainties and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the credit quality discussion below 
effective march   the company acquired redwood empire bancorp rebc  parent company of national bank of the redwoods 
the rebc acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations which requires valuing assets and liabilities which do not have quoted market prices 
in determining fair values for assets and liabilities without quoted market prices for the rebc acquisition  management engaged an independent consultant to determine such fair values 
critical assumptions used in the valuation included prevailing market interest rates on similar financial products  future cash flows  maturity structures and durations of similar financial products  the cost of processing deposit products  the interest rate structure for similar funding sources over the estimated duration of acquired deposits  the duration of customer relationships  and other critical assumptions 
overview of financial results operating results following the rebc acquisition include additional net interest income from rebc s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and higher merchant credit card income due to the rebc s card processing unit 
additionally  results included a million gain on sale of real estate  thousand in tax exempt life insurance proceeds  and million in securities losses 
acquisition the acquisition of rebc was completed on march   followed by a divestiture of a former rebc branch in lake county in the second quarter 
after adjusting for the divestiture the transaction was valued at approximately million  including approximately million paid in cash  issuance of approximately million shares of the company s common stock  and conversion of redwood empire stock options into company stock options based on an average stock price of 
rebc  on march   had approximately million loans  million deposits  million trust preferred subordinated debt  and million shareholders equity 
goodwill of million and identifiable intangibles of million were recorded in accordance with the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
during the second quarter of  the company sold a former rebc branch with approximately million in deposits  as required by the federal reserve in connection with its approval of the rebc acquisition 
a premium of million on the sale of the branch was recorded as a reduction of goodwill associated with the purchase of rebc 
net income the company reported net income for of million or diluted earnings per share  an increase of million over net income for of million  or diluted earnings per share 
results for include a million gain on sale of real estate  thousand in tax exempt life insurance proceeds  and million in securities losses which  on a combined basis  increased net income thousand 
results for included a million asset impairment writedown in the value of fnma and fhlmc preferred stock  a million loss on extinguishment of debt  and million realized losses on the sale of securities

investment portfolio the company maintains a securities portfolio consisting of us government sponsored entities  state and political subdivisions  asset backed and other securities 
investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian 
the objective of the held to maturity portfolio is to maintain a prudent yield  provide liquidity from maturities and paydowns  and provide collateral to pledge for federal  state and local government deposits and other borrowing facilities 
the held to maturity investment portfolio had a duration of years at december  and  on the same date  those investments included  million in fixed rate and million in adjustable rate securities 
investment securities available for sale are generally used to supplement the company s liquidity  provide a prudent yield  and provide collateral for public deposits 
unrealized net gains and losses on these securities are recorded as an adjustment to equity  net of taxes  but are not reflected in the current earnings of the company 
if a security is sold  any gain or loss is recorded as a credit or charge to earnings and the equity adjustment is reversed

credit quality the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and continues its strategy to control exposure to loans with higher credit risk and to increase diversification of the loan portfolio 
credit reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
loans receiving lesser grades fall under the classified loans category  which includes all nonperforming and potential problem loans  and receive an elevated level of management attention to ensure collection 

table of contents classified loans and other real estate owned the following summarizes the company s classified loans for the periods indicated classified loans and oreo at december  dollars in thousands classified loans other real estate owned total classified loans at december  increased million or to million from december   mainly due to the classified loans totaling million acquired from rebc  partially reduced by subsequent improvements in credit quality and loan payoffs 
other real estate owned was zero  unchanged from the prior year 
nonperforming loans nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and loans or more days past due and still accruing 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming delinquent days or more  unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
interest previously accrued on loans placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income 
in addition  some loans secured by real estate with temporarily impaired values and commercial loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties are placed on nonaccrual status even though the borrowers continue to repay the loans as scheduled 
such loans are classified by management as performing nonaccrual and are included in total nonaccrual loans 
when the ability to fully collect nonaccrual loan principal is in doubt  payments received are applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected 
any additional interest payments received after that time are recorded as interest income on a cash basis 
nonaccrual loans are reinstated to accrual status when improvements in credit quality eliminate the doubt as to the full collectibility of both interest and principal 
the following table summarizes the nonperforming assets of the company for the periods indicated nonperforming loans and oreo at december  dollars in thousands performing nonaccrual loans nonperforming nonaccrual loans nonaccrual loans loans or more days past due and still accruing other real estate owned total nonperforming loans and oreo as a percentage of total loans performing nonaccrual loans at december  were thousand higher than the previous year  as a result of the million performing nonaccrual loans acquired from rebc and new loans being placed on nonaccrual status  less charge offs  loans being returned to accrual status and loans being placed on nonperforming nonaccrual status 
except one relationship totaling thousand  performing nonaccrual loans at december  were either paid off  charged off or brought current in nonperforming nonaccrual loans at december  declined thousand compared with a year ago  attributable to loans being returned to accrual status  transfers to repossessed collateral or being charged off or paid off  partially offset by loans being added to nonperforming nonaccrual status 
with the exception of three relationships totaling million  all loans on nonperforming nonaccrual status at december  were either paid off  charged off or brought current in there was no other real estate owned oreo at december  since one property foreclosed during was disposed of at a small gain 
performing nonaccrual loans at december  were million higher than the previous year end  due to new loans placed on performing nonaccrual status  partially offset by payoffs  chargeoffs  loans being returned to accrual status and loans being placed on nonperforming nonaccrual status 
nonperforming nonaccrual loans at december  decreased million from a year ago  attributable to loans being returned to accrual status  transfers to repossessed collateral  or being charged off or paid off  partially offset by loans being added to nonperforming nonaccrual status 
there was no oreo at december  the company had no restructured loans as of december   and the amount of gross interest income that would have been recorded if all nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms while outstanding during the period was thousand in  thousand in and thousand in the amount of interest income that was recognized on nonaccrual loans from cash payments made in  and was thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively 
cash payments received  which were applied against the book balance of performing and nonperforming nonaccrual loans outstanding at december   totaled approximately thousand  compared with thousand and thousand at december  and  respectively 
management believes the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio continues to be strong  however  total nonperforming assets could fluctuate in the future 
the performance of any individual loan can be impacted by external factors such as the interest rate environment or factors particular to the borrower 
the company expects to maintain nonperforming loans and oreo at their current levels  however  no assurance can be given that increases in nonaccrual loans will not occur in future periods 
allowance for credit losses 
table of contents the company s allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be estimated based upon specific and general conditions 
these include conditions unique to individual borrowers  as well as overall credit loss experience  the amount of past due  nonperforming loans and classified loans  recommendations of regulatory authorities  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
a portion of the allowance is specifically allocated to impaired and other identified loans whose full collectibility is uncertain 
such allocations are determined by management based on loan by loan analyses 
a second allocation is based in part on quantitative analyses of historical credit loss experience  in which criticized and classified credit balances identified through an internal credit review process are analyzed using a linear regression model to determine standard loss rates 
the results of this analysis are applied to current criticized and classified loan balances to allocate the reserve to the respective segments of the loan portfolio 
in addition  loans with similar characteristics not usually criticized using regulatory guidelines are analyzed based on the historical loss rates and delinquency trends  grouped by the number of days the payments on these loans are delinquent 
last  allocations are made to general loan categories based on commercial office vacancy rates  mortgage loan foreclosure trends  agriculture commodity prices  and levels of government funding 
the remainder of the reserve is considered to be unallocated and is established at a level considered necessary based on relevant economic conditions and available data  including unemployment statistics  unidentified economic and business conditions  the quality of lending management and staff  credit quality trends  concentrations of credit  and changing underwriting standards due to external competitive factors 
management considers the million allowance for credit losses to be adequate as a reserve against losses as of december  during  management refined its allowance methodology for commercial real estate loans  agricultural loans and certain municipal loans 
this refinement had the effect of increasing the allowance allocation for commercial loans with a corresponding decrease in the unallocated allowance as of december  the following table summarizes the loan loss experience of the company for the periods indicated allowance for credit losses  chargeoffs recoveries year ended december  dollars in thousands total loans outstanding average loans outstanding during the period analysis of the allowance balance  beginning of period additions to the allowance charged to operating expense allowance acquired through merger loans charged off commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction real estate residential consumer total chargeoffs recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial and commercial real estate real estate construction real estate residential consumer total recoveries net loan losses balance  end of period components allowance for loan losses reserve for unfunded credit commitments allowance for credit losses net loan losses to average loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans outstanding allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans outstanding effective december   the company transferred the portion of the allowance for credit losses related to lending commitments and letters of credit to other liabilities

table of contents impaired loans the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impairment may be based on i the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the observable market price of the impaired loan or iii the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan 
the company does not apply this definition to smaller balance loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
in measuring impairment  the company reviews all commercial and construction loans classified substandard and doubtful that meet materiality thresholds of thousand and thousand  respectively 
all loans classified as loss are considered impaired 
commercial and construction loans that are not classified  and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans such as installment  personal revolving credit  residential real estate and student loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment under the company s standard loan loss reserve methodology 
the company generally identifies loans to be reported as impaired when such loans are placed on nonaccrual status or are considered troubled debt restructurings due to the granting of a below market rate of interest or a partial forgiveness of indebtedness on an existing loan 
the following summarizes the company s impaired loans for the dates indicated impaired loans at december  dollars in thousands total impaired loans specific reserves the average balance of the company s impaired loans for the year ended december  was thousand compared with thousand and million in and  respectively 
portions of the company s allowance for loan losses were allocated to each of these impaired loans 
in general  the company does not recognize any interest income on troubled debt restructuring or loans that are classified as nonaccrual 
however  interest income may be recorded as cash is received  provided that the company s recorded investment in such loans is deemed collectible 
asset and liability management the fundamental objective of the company s management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk results from many factors 
assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times 
assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by different amounts 
short term and long term market interest rates may change by different amounts 
the remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change 
in addition  interest rates may have an indirect impact on loan demand  credit losses  and other sources of earnings such as account analysis fees on commercial deposit accounts  official check fees and correspondent bank service charges 
in adjusting the company s asset liability position  management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing net interest margin and net interest income 
at times  depending on expected increases or decreases in general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  management may adjust the company s interest rate risk position in order to manage its net interest margin and net interest income 
the company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to changes in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short term interest rates 
management assesses interest rate risk by comparing the company s most likely earnings plan with various earnings models using many interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes  the degree of change over time  the speed of change and the projected shape of the yield curve 
for example  assuming an increase of bp in the federal funds rate and an increase of bp in the year constant maturity treasury bond yield during the same period  estimated earnings at risk would be approximately of the company s most likely net income plan for simulation estimates depend on  and will change with  the size and mix of the actual and projected balance sheet at the time of each simulation 
the company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk  even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the company s board of directors 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk  equity price risk and commodity price risk  are not significant in the normal course of the company s business activities 
during as the company reviewed its interest rate risk position to include the acquisition of rebc  in management s judgment  the company s interest rate risk exposure would be reduced through the sale of investment securities available for sale  with the proceeds from sale applied to reduce short term borrowed funds 
as a result  the company sold million of investment securities available for sale with a duration of years and book yield of at a realized loss of million 
liquidity the company s principal source of asset liquidity is investment securities available for sale and principal payments from consumer loans 
at december   investment securities available for sale totaled million 
at december   residential real estate loans and indirect auto loans totaled million  which were experiencing stable monthly principal payments of approximately million 
in addition  at december   the company had customary lines for overnight borrowings from other financial institutions in excess of million and a million line of credit  under which million was outstanding at december  as a member of the federal reserve system  the company also has the ability to borrow from the federal reserve

the operating cash flows in was more than sufficient to pay million in shareholder dividends and retire million of the company s common stock 
in  operating activities provided a substantial portion of cash for million in shareholder dividends and million of share repurchase activity 
during  the company financed its acquisition of rebc by issuing approximately million shares of common stock and approximately million to rebc shareholders 
the cash consideration was accumulated in the second half of and early as the company reduced its share repurchase activity 
the acquisition of rebc increased the loan portfolio by approximately million  deposits by approximately million  and subordinated debt by approximately million 
other investing activities included sale and maturity of investment securities  net of purchases  of approximately million 
the company sold approximately million of available for sale investment securities to manage the interest rate risk posture of its assets and liabilities subsequent to the rebc acquisition 
the company also experienced net loan repayments of million 
the proceeds from liquidating investment securities were applied to reduce short term borrowings by million 
the company also experienced a million decrease in deposit balances as interest sensitive cds and money market products declined while short term interest rates rose throughout in  purchases  net of sales and maturities  of investment securities were million  which was generally financed by a million increase in deposits and a million increase in short term borrowings 
in  purchases  net of maturities  of investment securities were million
