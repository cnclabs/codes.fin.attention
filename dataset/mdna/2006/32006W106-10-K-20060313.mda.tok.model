allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s assessment of the estimated probably credit losses in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date 
lending activities contain risks of loan losses 
management analyzes the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses regularly through reviews of the performance of the loan portfolio 
consideration is given to economic conditions  changes in interest rates and the effect of such changes on collateral values and borrower s ability to pay  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  and trends in past due and non performing loan balances 
the allowance for loan losses is a material estimate that is susceptible to significant fluctuation and is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
in addition to extensive in house loan monitoring procedures  the company utilizes an outside party to conduct an independent loan review of all commercial loan and commercial real estate loan relationships that exceed  of aggregate exposure 
management utilizes the results of this outside loan review to assess the effectiveness of its internal loan grading system as well as to assist in the assessment of the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses associated with this type of loans 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million compared to million at december  those balances represented and of outstanding loans as of december  and december  respectively 
the allowances acquired in the combanc and genoa acquisitions totaled million and  respectively and they were the most significant factor in the year over year growth in the allowance balance in determining the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses  first defiance evaluates all loans in its portfolio 
while allowances are frequently required for loans classified as substandard  it is possible for a credit relationship to be graded as substandard based on the financial performance of the credit for which no allowance is required because of other factors such as value of collateral or creditworthiness of guarantors 
at december   a total of million of loans are classified as substandard for which some level of reserve ranging between and of the outstanding balance is required 
a total of million in additional credits were classified as substandard at december  for which no reserve is required 
first defiance also has classified million as doubtful at december  first defiance also utilizes a general reserve percentage for loans not otherwise classified which ranges from for mortgage loans to for consumer loans 
general reserves for commercial and commercial real estate loans  the largest category in first defiance s portfolio  are established at of the outstanding balance 
the reserve percentage utilized for these loans is based on both historical losses in the company s portfolio  national statistics on loss percentages  regulatory guidance and empirical evidence regarding the strength of the economy in first defiance s general market area 
first defiance s ratio of allowance for loan losses to non performing loans dropped from at the end of to at december   the result of substantial non performing loans acquired as part of the two acquisitions 
through its due diligence prior to making the acquisitions  management was aware of the existence of non performing loans in both portfolios 
at december   first defiance had total non performing assets of million 
of that  million related to either the combanc or genoa acquisitions 
the balance of non performing assets which either were originated by first defiance or acquired in the rfc branch acquisition were million compared to million of non performing assets at december  while the level of classified loans has increased  year over year  management believes that the current allowance for loan losses is appropriate and that the provision for loan losses recorded in is consistent with both charge off experience and the strength of the overall credits in the portfolio 
first defiance s non performing assets at december  were just million compared to million at december  and million at december  non performing assets include loans that are days past due and all real estate owned and other foreclosed assets 
non performing assets at december  and by category were as follows december in thousands non performing loans single family residential  non residential and multi family residential real estate   commercial consumer finance total non performing loans   real estate owned and repossessed assets total non performing assets   non performing loans in the single family residential  non residential and multi family residential real estate and commercial loan categories represent  
and 
of the total loans in those categories respectively at december  compared to  and respectively for the same categories at december  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover any estimated losses from non performing loans 
loans acquired with impairment certain loans acquired in the combanc and genoa acquisitions had evidence that the credit quality of the loan had deteriorated since its origination and in management s assessment at the acquisition date it was probable that the first defiance would be unable to collect all contractually required payments due 
in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer sop  these loans have been recorded based on management s estimate of the fair value of the loans 
at the acquisition date of january   loans with a contractual receivable of million were acquired from combanc which were deemed impaired 
those loans were recorded at a net realizable value of million 
on april   loans with a contractual receivable of million were acquired from genoa which were deemed impaired 
those loans were recorded at a net realizable value of  as of december   the total contractual receivable for those loans was million and the recorded value was million 
in determining the fair value of these loans  management evaluated the likelihood of receiving full payment under the contractual terms 
because of the nature of the types of loans identified  estimates of specific cash flows are not readily determinable 
the loans acquired that are within the scope of sop are not accounted for using the income recognition model of the sop because the company cannot reasonably estimate cash flows expected to be collected 
see note in the financial statements 
high loan to value mortgage loans the majority of first defiance s mortgage loans are collateralized by one to four family residential real estate  have loan to value ratios of or less  and are made to borrowers in good credit standing 
frist federal usually requires residential mortgage loan borrowers whose loan to value is greater than to purchase private mortgage insurance pmi 
first federal does originate and retain a limited number of residential mortgage loans with loan to value ratios that exceed where pmi is not required if the borrower possesses other demonstrable strengths 
the loan to value ratios on these loans are generally limited to and exceptions must be approved by first federal s senior loan committee 
mortgage loans whose balances when combined with applicable second mortgages exceed of the appraised value with no pmi totaled million at december  these loans are generally paying as agreed 
in addition to first mortgages that exceed loan to value  first defiance makes home equity loans which  when combined with first mortgage loans  held either by first federal or by other lenders  have potential exposure in excess of 
first defiance generally will not make home equity loans that exceed loan to value and exceptions to that guideline must be approved by first federal s senior loan committee 
first defiance s total exposure for home equity loans that exceed is million at december  these loans are generally paying as agreed 
first defiance does not make interest only first mortgage residential loans  nor does it have residential mortgage loan products  or other consumer products that allow negative amortization 
securities the securities portfolio declined million to million at december  only a minimal amount of securities were acquired in the acquisitions 
the activity in the portfolio in included million of purchases  million of amortization and maturities  million of sales and a net decrease of million in market value 
the decline in market value in was attributable primarily to rising interest rates and that decline is believed to be temporary 
management took advantage of the rate environment and sold a portion of the portfolio in order to realize gains totaling million 
proceeds of those sales were used primarily to fund loan growth 
in addition  management maintained approximately million in overnight investments as of december  goodwill and intangible assets goodwill increased million to million at december  the combanc and genoa acquisitions added million and million respectively to goodwill for the year

the combanc acquisition added million of deposits and genoa added million 
the remaining activity was a net increase of million 
non interest bearing checking grew by million while money market and interest bearing checking accounts grew by million  savings by million  and certificates of deposit by million 
excluding the acquisitions  non interest bearing accounts increased by million during and certificates of deposit increased by million while interest bearing checking and money market accounts declined by million and savings accounts declined by this swing is attributable to improved cd rates during management periodically utilizes brokered certificates of deposit to supplement its funding needs 
at december  the balance of brokered cds totaled million  down from million at december  borrowings fhlb advances totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the balance at the end of includes million of convertible advances with rates ranging from to 
these advances are all callable by the fhlb  at which point they would convert to a three month libor advance if not paid off 
those advances have final maturity dates ranging from to in addition  first defiance has advances totaling million that are callable by the fhlb only if the three month libor rate exceeds a strike rate ranging from to 
the rate on those advances ranges from to 
first defiance also has million outstanding at the fhlb under a series of fixed rate loans and million borrowed on an overnight basis at december  first defiance also has million of securities that have been sold at december  with agreements to repurchase  an increase of this type of funding of million over december  the combanc acquisition accounted for approximately million of that growth 
in october  the company issued million of subordinated debentures 
these debentures were issued to an unconsolidated affiliated trust that purchased them with the proceeds from a million issued of trust preferred securities to an outside party 
the proceeds of the subordinated debentures were used for general corporate purposes 
the subordinated debentures have a rate equal to three month libor plus 
capital resources total shareholders equity increased million to million at december  this increase is primarily comprised of million of stock issued in conjunction with the combanc acquisition and million for net income 
those increases were offset by million of dividends per share declared  million in after tax market value adjustments to the available for sale securities portfolio and million for treasury stock repurchases 
the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of  shares in a total of  shares were repurchased in at an average cost of and  shares remain to be purchased under the authorization

with recent increases in interest rates  the cost of carrying those liquid assets has declined relative to longer investment options 
total interest income increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in income was due to an increase in the average balance of loans receivable  to million for the twelve months of compared to million for during the same period  the average balance of lower yielding investment securities declined to million in from million in and funds held on deposit at other financial institutions dropped to an average of just million in from million in while loan yields between and dropped to from  that basis point decline was more than offset by the change in the mix between loans and lower yielding assets

mortgage banking income totaled million  million and million in  and respectively 
that  of growth in over was primarily attributable to the recapture of  of previously recorded mortgage servicing rights impairment and a  increase in mortgage servicing fees resulting from a million increase in the portfolio of mortgage loans serviced for others 
gains from the sale of mortgage loans totaled million for both and the higher level of mortgage banking income in was the result of significant mortgage loan origination activity  a result of the major mortgage refinancing wave which occurred in those periods 
gains from sale of loans in were million 
the higher level of gains in was offset somewhat by higher levels of mortgage servicing rights amortization million in compared to just  and  in and respectively 
also there have been significant fluctuations in the level of mortgage servicing rights impairment adjustments over the past three years  ranging from impairment expense of  and  in and respectively  to a recovery of previously recorded impairment of  in the balance of the impairment allowance stands at just  at the end of following the recording of a  permanent mortgage servicing rights write down in see note to the financial statements 
first defiance also realized million of securities gains in compared to million in and million in in all three years  management took advantage of favorable prices in the bond portfolio as long term interest rates stayed low 
generally as investments were sold out of the investment portfolio  the related proceeds were used to fund loan growth or they were reinvested in shorter term securities in order to position the company for an eventual overall rate increase 
non interest expense total non interest expense for was million compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the results include million of acquisition related charges while the amount includes a charge of million related to the final settlement of a contingent liability related to first defiance s sale of its leader mortgage subsidiary 
non interest expense  excluding the acquisition related charges in and the settlement of the contingency in  was million and million respectively for those two years

first defiance s other non interest expense category also increased to million in from million in increases in that category resulted from higher levels of advertising up  printing and office supplies up  postage up  and bad check charge offs and other related deposit account losses up 
the increase in non interest expense in from was the primarily due to a million increase in compensation and benefits expense 
occupancy costs and data processing costs also increased in by  and  respectively 
as noted  the non interest expense included million of acquisition related costs 
of these costs  million related to the combanc acquisition and related to the genoa acquisition

concentrations of credit risk financial institutions such as first defiance generate income primarily through lending and investing activities 
the risk of loss from lending and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment agreement 
this possibility is known as credit risk 
lending or investing activities that concentrate assets in a way that exposes the company to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of occurrences increases credit risk 
diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one manner a financial institution can reduce potential losses due to credit risk 
examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower and loans of inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution 
management believes adherence to its loan and investment policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels 
first defiance s loan portfolio is concentrated geographically in its northwest ohio market area 
there are no industry concentrations that exceed of the company s loan portfolio 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through first federal s branch network  along with unused wholesale sources of funding and its capital base

the adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by or used in operations during the periods presented consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of loans less the origination of loans held for sale  the provision for loan losses  depreciation expense  the origination  amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights  esop expense related to the release of esop shares in accordance with aicpa sop and increases and decreases in other assets and liabilities 
in a typical year  the primary investing activity of first defiance is lending  which is funded with cash provided from operating and financing activities  as well as proceeds from payment on existing loans and proceeds from maturities of investment securities 
in  first defiance completed the acquisitions of combanc and genoa 
in the case of the combanc acquisition  which was purchased with a combination of stock and cash  first defiance realized an increase in cash of million after netting the cash that was acquired from combanc 
combanc s cash level was high because they liquidated their investment portfolio in advance of the acquisition closing date 
in the case of the genoa acquisition  the acquisition resulted in a net reduction in cash of  after netting genoa s cash balances against the purchase price 
in  first defiance completed the rfc acquisition  which increased cash from investing activities by million as deposits acquired exceeded the purchase price plus loans acquired

critical accounting policies first defiance has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of its financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of first defiance are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of first defiance 
allowance for loan losses first defiance believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
in determining the appropriate estimate for the allowance for loan losses  management considers a number of factors relative to both specific credits in the loan portfolio and macro economic factors relative to the economy of the united states as a whole and the economy of the northwest ohio region in which the company does business 
factors relative to specific credits that are considered include a customer s payment history  a customer s recent financial performance  an assessment of the value of collateral held  knowledge of the customer s character  the financial strength and commitment of any guarantors  the existence of any customer or industry concentrations  changes in a customer s competitive environment  and any other issues that may impact a customer s ability to meet his obligations 
economic factors that are considered include levels of unemployment and inflation  specific plant or business closings in the company s market area  the impact of strikes or other work stoppages  the impact of weather or environmental conditions  especially relative to agricultural borrowers and other matters than may have an impact on the economy as a whole 
in addition to the identification of specific customers who may be potential credit problems  management considers its historical losses  the results of independent loan reviews  an assessment of the adherence to underwriting standards  the loss experience being reported by other financial institutions operating in the company s market area  and other factors in providing for loan losses that have not been specifically classified 
while management believes its allowance for loan losses is conservatively determined based on the above factors  it does not believe the allowances to be excessive or unnecessary 
refer to the section titled allowance for loan losses and note  statement of accounting policies for a further description of the company s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights first defiance believes the valuations of mortgage servicing rights is a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
first defiance recognizes as separate assets the value of mortgage servicing rights  which are acquired through loan origination activities 
first defiance does not purchase any mortgage servicing rights 
key assumptions made by management relative to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights include the stratification policy used in valuing servicing  assumptions relative to future prepayments of mortgages  the potential value of any escrow deposits maintained or ancillary income received as a result of the servicing activity and discount rates used to value the present value of a future cash flow stream 
in assessing the value of the mortgage servicing rights portfolio  management utilizes a third party that specializes in valuing servicing portfolios 
that third party reviews key assumptions with management prior to completing the valuation 
prepayment speeds are determined based on projected median prepayment speeds for and year mortgage backed securities 
those speeds are then adjusted up or down based on the size of the loan 
the discount rate used in this analysis is the pretax yield generally required by purchasers of bulk servicing rights as of the valuation date 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is especially vulnerable in a falling interest rate environment 
refer also to the section entitled mortgage servicing rights and note  statement of accounting policies  and note  mortgage banking  for a further description of first defiance s valuation process  methodology and assumptions along with sensitivity analyses 
forward looking information forward looking statements in this report are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this report which are not historical fact are forward looking statements and they include  among other statements  projections about growth in the financial condition section  comments about the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and projections about interest rate simulations included in the asset liability management section 
actual results may differ from expectations contained in such forward looking information as a result of factors including but not limited to the interest rate environment  economic policy or conditions  federal and state banking and tax regulations  and competitive factors in the marketplace 
each of these factors could affect estimates  assumptions  uncertainties and risks considered in the development of forward looking information and could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectation regarding future performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk asset liability management a significant portion of the company s revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  the company strives to manage its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of the company s performance due to changes in interest rates 
the company attempts to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
first defiance does not presently use off balance sheet derivatives to enhance its risk management 
first defiance monitors interest rate risk on a monthly basis through simulation analysis that measures the impact changes in interest rates can have on net interest income 
the simulation technique analyzes the effect of a presumed basis point shift in interest rates which is consistent with management s estimate of the range of potential interest rate fluctuations and takes into account prepayment speeds on amortizing financial instruments  loan and deposit volumes and rates  non maturity deposit assumptions and capital requirements 
the results of the simulation indicate that in an environment where interest rates rise basis points over a month period  first defiance s net interest income would increase by just over the base case scenario 
were interest rates to fall by basis points during the same month period  the simulation indicates that net interest income would decrease by only 
it should be noted that other areas of first defiance s income statement  such as gains from sales of mortgage loans and amortization of mortgage servicing rights are also impacted by fluctuations in interest rates but are not considered in the simulation of net interest income 
the majority of first defiance s lending activities are in the non residential real estate and commercial loan areas 
while such loans carry higher credit risk than residential mortgage lending  they tend to be more rate sensitive than residential mortgage loans 
the balance of first defiance s non residential and multi family real estate loan portfolio was million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  the commercial loan portfolio increased to million  which is split between million of fixed rate loans and million of adjustable rate loans at december  certain of the loans classified as adjustable have fixed rates for an initial term that may be as long as five years 
the maturities on fixed rate loans are generally less than years 
first defiance also has significant balances of consumer loans million at december  which tend to have a shorter duration than residential mortgage loans  and home equity and improvement loans million at december  which fluctuate with changes in the prime lending rate 
also  to limit its interest rate risk  as well as to provide liquidity first federal sells a majority of its fixed rate mortgage originations into the secondary market 
in addition to the simulation analysis  first federal also prepares an economic value of equity eve analysis 
this analysis calculates the net present value of first federal s assets and liabilities in rate shock environments that range from basis points to basis points 
the results of this analysis are reflected in the following table 
december  economic value of equity as of economic value of equity present value of assets change in rates amount change change ratio change dollars in thousands bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp bp  bp   bp bp   bp bp   bp based on the above analysis  in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates as of december   first federal would experience a decrease in its economic value of equity 
if rates would fall by basis points its economic value of equity would increase by 
during periods of rising rates  the value of monetary assets declines 
conversely  during periods of falling rates  the value of monetary assets increases 
it should be noted that the amount of change in value of specific assets and liabilities due to changes in rates is not the same in a rising rate environment as in a falling rate environment 
based on the eve analysis  the change in the economic value of equity in both rising and falling rate environments is relatively low because both its assets and liabilities have relatively short durations and the durations are fairly closely matched 
the average duration of its assets at december  was years while the average duration of its liabilities was years 
in evaluating first federal s exposure to interest rate risk  certain shortcomings inherent in the each of the methods of analysis presented must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market rates while interest rates on other types of financial instruments may lag behind current changes in market rates 
furthermore  in the event of changes in rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels could differ significantly from the assumptions in calculating the table and the results therefore may differ from those presented
