the company s board of directors approved additional million authorizations to the company s existing share repurchase program on february  and july  in connection with the may acquisition  the company suspended repurchases under the company s share repurchase program 
as of january   the share repurchase program had approximately million of authorization remaining 
the company currently anticipates resuming its share repurchase program sometime in the second or third quarter of the company is a party to a five year credit agreement with certain financial institutions providing for revolving credit borrowings and letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed billion which amount may be increased to billion at the option of the company outstanding at any particular time 
this agreement expires august  and replaces the previous five year credit agreement which was set to expire june  as of january   the company had no borrowings outstanding under the five year credit agreement 
in connection with the merger  the company entered into a day bridge credit agreement with certain financial institutions providing for revolving credit borrowings in an aggregate amount initially not to exceed billion outstanding at any particular time 
the aggregate amount of the facility will be reduced upon the receipt by the company of net cash proceeds from certain events  including certain sales or other dispositions of assets aggregating million or more  the issuance of certain equity interests and the incurrence of certain long term indebtedness 
the aggregate amount of the facility has been reduced to billion as a result of the proceeds received from the sale of the fds credit assets 
as of january   the company had no borrowings outstanding under the day bridge credit agreement 
in connection with the merger  the company entered into an unsecured commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue and sell commercial paper in an aggregate amount outstanding at any particular time not to exceed its then current combined borrowing availability under the revolving credit facilities described above 
as of january   the company had  million of commercial paper outstanding under its commercial paper program 
the company funded the cash consideration payable in the merger originally through cash on hand and borrowings under its day bridge credit agreement 
the company subsequently issued commercial paper and utilized the proceeds thereof and additional cash on hand to pay down the borrowings under the day bridge credit agreement 
the company s bank credit agreements require the company to maintain a specified interest coverage ratio of no less than and a specified leverage ratio of no more than 
the interest coverage ratio for was and at january  the leverage ratio was 
management believes that the likelihood of the company defaulting on these requirements in the future is remote absent any material negative event affecting the us economy as a whole 
however  if the company s results of operations or operating ratios deteriorate to a point where the company is not in compliance with any of its debt covenants and the company is unable to obtain a waiver  much of the company s debt would be in default and could become due and payable immediately 
at january   the company had contractual obligations within the scope of item a of regulation s k as follows obligations due  by period less than more than total year years years years millions short term debt long term debt interest on debt capital lease obligations other long term liabilities operating leases letters of credit other obligations other obligations in the foregoing table consist primarily of significant merchandise purchase obligations and obligations under outsourcing arrangements  construction contracts  employment contracts  group medical dental life insurance programs and energy and other supply agreements identified by the company 
the company s merchandise purchase obligations fluctuate on a seasonal basis  typically being higher in the summer and early fall and being lower in the late winter and early spring 
the company purchases a substantial portion of its merchandise inventories and other goods and services otherwise than through binding contracts 
consequently  the amounts shown as other obligations in the foregoing table do not reflect the total amounts that the company would need to spend on goods and services in order to operate its businesses in the ordinary course 
management believes that  with respect to the company s current operations  cash on hand and funds from operations  together with its credit facilities and other capital resources  will be sufficient to cover the company s reasonably foreseeable working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements in both the near term and over the longer term 
the company s ability to generate funds from operations may be affected by numerous factors  including general economic conditions and levels of consumer confidence and demand  however  the company expects to be able to manage its working capital levels and capital expenditure amounts so as to maintain sufficient levels of liquidity 
for short term liquidity  the company also relies on its unsecured commercial paper facility which is discussed above 
access to the unsecured commercial paper program is primarily dependent on the company s credit ratings  a downgrade in its short term ratings could hinder its ability to access this market 
if the company is unable to access the unsecured commercial paper market  it has the current ability to access billion pursuant to its bank credit agreements  subject to compliance with the interest coverage and leverage ratio requirements discussed above and other requirements under the agreements 
depending upon conditions in the capital markets and other factors  the company will from time to time consider the issuance of debt or other securities  or other possible capital markets transactions  the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other corporate purposes 
management believes the retail business will continue to consolidate 
the company intends from time to time to consider additional acquisitions of  and investments in  department stores and other complementary assets and companies 
acquisition transactions  if any  are expected to be financed from one or more of the following sources cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under existing or new credit facilities and the issuance of long term debt  commercial paper or other securities  including common stock 
critical accounting policies allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its proprietary accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including analysis of historical trends  aging of accounts receivable  write off experience and expectations of future performance 
proprietary accounts receivable are considered delinquent if more than one scheduled minimum payment is missed 
delinquent proprietary accounts are generally written off automatically after the passage of days without receiving a full scheduled monthly payment 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
the company reserves for doubtful proprietary accounts with a methodology based upon historical write off performance in addition to factoring in a flow rate performance tied to the customer delinquency trend 
at january   a percentage point change in the result of the reserve methodology would impact the proprietary reserve for doubtful accounts by approximately million 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the last in  first out lifo retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics  and is stated at its current retail selling value 
inventory retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying specific average cost factors for each merchandise department 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise department based on beginning inventory and the fiscal year purchase activity 
the retail inventory method inherently requires management judgments and contains estimates  such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory  which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margins 
permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the utility of the inventory has diminished 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
when a decision is made to permanently mark down merchandise  the resulting gross profit reduction is recognized in the period the markdown is recorded 
the company receives cash allowances from merchandise vendors as purchase price adjustments 
purchase price adjustments are credited to cost of sales in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal period 
such estimates are based on experience and the most recent physical inventory results 
while it is not possible to quantify the impact from each cause of shrinkage  the company has loss prevention programs and policies that are intended to minimize shrinkage 
physical inventories are generally taken within each merchandise department annually and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
long lived asset impairment and restructuring charges the carrying values of long lived assets are periodically reviewed by the company whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred 
for long lived assets held for use  a potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets 
the estimate of cash flows includes management s assumptions of cash inflows and outflows directly resulting from the use of those assets in operations 
when a potential impairment has occurred  an impairment write down is recorded if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the company believes its estimated cash flows are sufficient to support the carrying value of its long lived assets 
if estimated cash flows significantly differ in the future  the company may be required to record asset impairment write downs 
for long lived assets held for disposal by sale  an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds its fair value less costs to sell 
such valuations include estimations of fair values and incremental direct costs to transact a sale 
for long lived assets to be abandoned  the company considers the asset to be disposed of when it ceases to be used 
if the company commits to a plan to abandon a long lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life  depreciation estimates are revised accordingly 
in addition  liabilities arise such as severance  contractual obligations and other accruals associated with store closings from decisions to dispose of assets 
the company estimates these liabilities based on the facts and circumstances in existence for each restructuring decision 
the amounts the company will ultimately realize or disburse could differ from the amounts assumed in arriving at the asset impairment and restructuring charge recorded 
the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed annually for possible impairment 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach at the reporting unit level  that requires significant management judgment with respect to sales  gross margin and expense growth rates  and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted future operating cash flows and could increase or decrease an impairment charge 
the occurrence of an unexpected event or change in circumstances  such as adverse business conditions or other economic factors  would determine the need for impairment testing between annual impairment tests 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured for workers compensation and public liability claims up to certain maximum liability amounts 
although the amounts accrued are actuarially determined by third parties based on analysis of historical trends of losses  settlements  litigation costs and other factors  the amounts the company will ultimately disburse could differ from such accrued amounts 
pension and supplementary retirement plans the company has funded defined benefit pension plans the pension plans and unfunded defined benefit supplementary retirement plans the serps 
the company accounts for these plans using sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
under sfas no 
 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
pension expense calculated under sfas no 
is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
the company anticipates that pension expense and other retirement costs relating to continuing operations will increase by approximately million in  compared to  reflecting a full year of expenses related to may 
funding requirements for the pension plans are determined by government regulations  not sfas no 
although no funding contributions were required  the company made a million voluntary funding contribution to the pension plans in and a million voluntary funding contribution to the pension plans in the company currently anticipates that it will not be required to make any additional contributions to the pension plans until the company has not yet determined whether a voluntary contribution will be made to the pension plans prior to this date 
at january   the company had unrecognized actuarial losses of million for the pension plans and million for the serps 
these losses will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years in accordance with sfas no 
the calculation of pension expense and pension liabilities requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience may differ significantly from current expectations 
the company believes that the most critical assumptions relate to the long term rate of return on plan assets in the case of the pension plans  the discount rate used to determine the present value of projected benefit obligations and the weighted average rate of increase of future compensation levels 
the company has assumed that the pension plans assets will generate a long term rate of return of for and the company develops its long term rate of return assumption by evaluating input from several professional advisors taking into account the asset allocation of the portfolio and long term asset class return expectations  as well as long term inflation assumptions 
pension expense increases or decreases as the expected rate of return on the assets of the pension plans decreases or increases  respectively 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on the pension plans assets by from to would increase the estimated pension expense by approximately million and raising the expected long term rate of return on the pension plans assets by from to would decrease the estimated pension expense by approximately million 
the company discounted its future pension obligations using a rate of at december   compared to at december  the company determines the appropriate discount rate with reference to the current yield earned on an index of investment grade long term bonds and the impact of a yield curve analysis to account for the difference in duration between the long term bonds and the pension plans and serps estimated payments 
pension liability and future pension expense both increase or decrease as the discount rate is reduced or increased  respectively 
lowering the discount rate by from to would increase the projected benefit obligation at january  by approximately million and would increase estimated pension expense by approximately million 
increasing the discount rate by from to would decrease the projected benefit obligation at january  by approximately million and would decrease estimated pension expense by approximately million 
the assumed weighted average rate of increase in future compensation levels was as of december  and december  for the pension plans  and as of december  and december  for the serps 
the company develops its increase of future compensation level assumption based on recent experience 
pension liabilities and future pension expense both increase or decrease as the weighted average rate of increase of future compensation levels is increased or decreased  respectively 
increasing or decreasing the assumed weighted average rate of increase of future compensation levels by would increase or decrease the projected benefit obligation at january  by approximately million and change estimated pension expense by approximately million

under the provisions of this statement  the company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition alternatives include retrospective and prospective adoption methods 
under the retrospective method  prior periods may be restated based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either for all periods presented or as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recognized beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of this statement  for all share based payments granted after the effective date  and based on the requirements of sfas  for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of this statement that remain unvested on the effective date 
the company has decided to adopt sfas r for its fiscal year beginning january  using the prospective method 
the impact of adopting sfas r cannot be accurately estimated since it will depend on levels of share based awards granted in the future  the stock price at the date of grant and other factors used in the black scholes options pricing model
