item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the results of operations and the liquidity and capital resources of the partnership for the periods indicated below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the partnership s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this report 
overview the partnership is a master limited partnership which operates through subsidiary entities the operating subsidiaries in the transportation  terminalling and storage of refined petroleum products on a fee basis through facilities owned and operated by the partnership 
the partnership also operates pipelines owned by third parties under contracts with major integrated oil and chemical companies  and performs certain construction activities  generally for the owners of these third party pipelines 
during and  the partnership significantly expanded its operations through acquisitions 
on october   the partnership acquired refined petroleum products pipelines with an aggregate mileage of approximately miles and refined products terminals with an aggregate storage capacity of million barrels the midwest pipelines and terminals from shell oil products us  shell for a purchase price of million 
in may  the partnership acquired a refined petroleum products pipeline system comprising approximately miles of pipeline and four refined products terminals with aggregate storage capacity of approximately million barrels located principally in the northeastern united states the northeast pipelines and terminals from affiliates of exxon mobil corporation exxonmobil 
the assets acquired in these two acquisitions added million and million of revenue in and  respectively 
in november the partnership acquired a mile ammonia pipeline located in texas 
in december  the partnership acquired a mile pipeline and a interest in a joint venture company that owns another refined petroleum products pipeline and terminal 
as a result of the expansion of the partnership s operations  in the fourth quarter of  the partnership determined that its operations are most appropriately presented in three operating segments pipeline operations  terminalling and storage and other operations 
the business of each operating segment is pipeline operations the pipeline operations segment receives refined petroleum products including gasoline  jet and diesel fuel and other distillates from refineries  connecting pipelines  bulk and marine terminals and transports those products to other locations for a fee 
as of december   this segment owned and operated approximately  miles of pipeline systems in the following states california  connecticut  florida  illinois  indiana  massachusetts  michigan  missouri  new jersey  nevada  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and tennessee 
terminalling and storage the terminalling and storage segment provides bulk storage and terminal throughput services 
this segment owns and operates active terminals that have the capacity to store an aggregate of approximately million barrels of refined petroleum products 
the terminals are located in illinois  indiana  massachusetts  michigan  missouri  new york  ohio and pennsylvania 
other operations the other operations segment consists primarily of the partnership s operations of third party pipelines owned principally by major petrochemical companies pursuant to operations and maintenance contracts 
the third party pipelines are located in texas 
this segment also includes the provision by the partnership  through its bgc subsidiary  of pipeline construction management services  typically for cost plus a fixed fee 
the other operations segment also includes the partnership s ownership and operation of an ammonia pipeline acquired in november  and its majority ownership of a crude butadiene pipeline located in texas the sabina pipeline 
the partnership entered into equity and debt financings to fund its asset acquisitions in and these financings are more fully described under liquidity and capital resources in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations summary operating results for the partnership were as follows year ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts revenue costs and expenses operating income other income expenses net income earnings per unit basic earnings per unit assuming dilution in  the partnership repaid million of senior notes of buckeye 
in conjunction with this repayment  the partnership incurred a yield maintenance premium of million  which has been reflected in other income expenses in the partnership s financial statements 
the partnership s net income before the yield maintenance premium was million  or per unit 
to supplement its financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  the partnership s management has used the financial measure of net income before the yield maintenance premium 
the partnership has presented net income before the yield maintenance premium in this discussion to enhance an investor s overall understanding of the way that management analyzes the partnership s financial performance 
specifically  the partnership s management used the presentation of net income before the yield maintenance premium to allow for a more meaningful comparison of the partnership s operating results in and which were not impacted by the yield maintenance premium to which were impacted by the yield maintenance premium 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of net income before the yield maintenance premium to net income  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap  is as follows in thousands net income before the yield maintenance premium yield maintenance premium net income the improvement in revenues and operating income in compared to  and compared to  is generally due to the expansion of the partnership s operations through the addition of the northeast pipelines and terminals in and the midwest pipelines and terminals in earnings per unit were impacted by the issuance of million lp units in october  million lp units in february and million lp units in may revenues and operating income by operating segment for each of the three years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in thousands revenues pipeline operations terminalling and storage other operations total operating income pipeline operations terminalling and storage other operations total results of operations are affected by factors that include general economic conditions  weather  competitive conditions  demand for refined petroleum products  seasonal factors and regulation

during  and  the partnership s principal sources of cash were cash from operations  borrowings under its revolving credit facility and proceeds from the financing transactions described under cash flows from financing activities below 
the partnership s principal uses of cash are capital expenditures  investments and acquisitions  distributions to unitholders and repayments of borrowings 
at december   the partnership had million aggregate face amount of long term debt  which consisted of million of the partnership s notes due the notes  million of the partnership s notes due the notes  million of the partnership s notes due the notes and million of the partnership s notes due the notes along with million borrowed under the partnership s revolving credit facility described below 
on august   the partnership entered into a million year revolving credit facility the credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by suntrust bank 
the credit facility contains a one time expansion feature to million subject to certain conditions 
borrowings under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of the partnership s subsidiaries 
the credit facility matures on august  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest under one of two rate options  selected by the partnership  equal to either i the greater of a the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent and b suntrust bank s prime rate or ii the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is determined based upon ratings assigned by standard and poors and moody s investor services for the partnership s senior unsecured non credit enhanced long term debt 
the applicable margin  which was at december   will increase during any period in which the partnership s funded debt ratio described below exceeds to at december   the partnership had million outstanding under the credit facility and the weighted average interest rate was  consisting of million borrowed at a libor rate of and million borrowed at the base rate of 
the credit facility contains covenants and provisions that restrict the partnership s and certain subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness based on certain ratios described below  prohibit the partnership and certain subsidiaries from creating or incurring certain liens on its property  prohibit the partnership and certain subsidiaries from disposing of property material to its operations  and limit consolidations  mergers and asset transfers by the partnership and certain subsidiaries 
the credit facility requires that the partnership and its subsidiaries maintain a maximum funded debt ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the funded debt ratio equals the ratio of the long term debt of the partnership including the current portion  if any to the partnership s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization and incentive compensation payments to the general partner adjusted ebitda  for the four preceding fiscal quarters 
as of the end of any fiscal quarter  the funded debt ratio may not exceed to  subject to a provision for increases to to in connection with future acquisitions 
at december   the partnership s funded debt ratio was to 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of adjusted ebitda for the four preceding fiscal quarters to the sum of payments for interest and principal on debt plus certain capital expenditures required for the ongoing maintenance and operation of the partnership s assets 
the partnership is required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of greater than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter 
as of december   the partnership s fixed charge coverage ratio was to 
at december   the partnership was in compliance with the remainder of its covenants under the credit facility 
in january  the partnership borrowed an additional million under the credit facility in order to fund the acquisitions of a terminal in niles  michigan and a natural gas liquids pipeline located in colorado and kansas 
the partnership s financial strategy is to maintain an investment grade credit rating  which involves  among other things  the issuance of additional lp units in connection with the partnership s acquisitions and internal growth activities in order to maintain acceptable financial ratios  including total debt to total capital 
from through  the partnership has issued approximately million of its lp units in support of its acquisition and growth strategies and has not experienced any difficulties in accessing equity capital 
the partnership may issue additional lp units in and beyond to partially fund acquisitions and internal growth activities  market conditions permitting 
the partnership is subject  however  to changes in the equity markets for its lp units  and there can be no assurance the partnership will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for its lp units in the future 
if the partnership were unable or unwilling to issue additional lp units  the partnership would be required to either restrict potential future acquisitions or pursue other debt financing alternatives  some of which could involve higher costs 
based on the partnership s existing operations  however  the partnership anticipates that cash from operations plus amounts available under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund its cash requirements for cash flows from operations the components of cash flows from operations for the years ended december   and are as follows cash flows from operations in thousands net income premium paid on retirement of long term debt depreciation and amortization minority interests changes in current assets and liabilities changes in other assets and liabilities other total cash flows from operations were million in  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the principal reason for the increase was the partnership s increase in net income of million  coupled with an increase in depreciation and amortization of million  a non cash expense 
depreciation and amortization increased by million as a result of the inclusion of the midwest pipelines and terminals for twelve months in compared to three months in  as well as the addition of the northeast pipelines and terminals in may  along with ongoing capital additions 
also  in the partnership experienced a million increase in working capital resulting from the operations it acquired with the midwest pipelines and terminals which was not repeated in working capital increased by million 
in  an increase in trade and other receivables of million and construction and pipeline relocation receivables of million related to timing of pipeline billings were principally offset by a reduction in prepaid and other current assets of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
in  trade receivables increased by million and construction receivables increased by million 
the increase in trade receivables was related to increased outstanding billings related primarily to the terminal assets acquired as part of the midwest pipelines and terminals 
in connection with terminal revenue  the partnership bills on a monthly basis  compared to the weekly basis used in pipeline billings 
construction and pipeline relocation receivables increased in due to an increase in construction activity in the fourth quarter 
prepaid and other current assets increased by million in  principally related to insurance receivables associated with environmental claims 
partially offsetting these reductions in cash from operations were increases in accounts payable of million and accrued and other current liabilities of million 
the increase in accrued and other current liabilities resulted from an increase in accrued interest payable related to the timing of the semi annual interest payments due on the partnership s notes issued in october and an increase in accrued environmental liabilities 
cash flows from operations were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the principal reason for the decrease was the increase in working capital of million described above compared to a decrease in working capital of million in in  an increase in prepaid and other current assets of million was more than offset by increases in accounts payable of million and accrued and other current liabilities of million 
during trade receivables balances were essentially unchanged 
in  accounts payable increased by million mostly due to certain insurance amounts payable at year end 
accrued and other liabilities increased in by million principally due to an increase in accrued interest related to the timing of the semi annual interest payments due on the partnership s and notes 
these changes more than offset the increase in net income of million in to million compared to net income before the yield maintenance premium of million in depreciation and amortization  a non cash expense  increased by million in compared to as a result of the addition of the midwest pipelines and terminals and ongoing capital additions 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and are as follows investing activities in millions capital expenditures acquisitions and investments other total in  cash used for investments and acquisitions consisted of the northeast pipelines and terminals million  with the balance expended in connection with a terminal acquisition in taylor  michigan  a deposit for a natural gas liquids pipeline acquired in january  an ammonia pipeline located near houston  tx and the acquisition of the remainder of wespac reno 
in  investments and acquisitions consisted of the acquisition of the midwest pipelines and terminals 
in  the partnership invested million for a interest in wtp million and an additional interest in west shore million 
in addition  in december  the partnership acquired an approximately mile pipeline and a interest in muskegon pipeline llc muskegon  which owns an approximately mile pipeline which extends from griffith  in to muskegon mi together  the pipeline interests 
the pipeline interests were acquired in exchange for consideration that included capacity lease agreements with purchase options related to one of the partnership s pipelines and a terminal 
the partnership has recorded the pipeline interests at their estimated fair values of million  with million allocated to the mile pipeline and million allocated to the interest in muskegon 
capital expenditures are summarized below capital expenditures in millions sustaining capital expenditures operating infrastructure pipeline and tank integrity total sustaining expansion and cost reduction total during  the partnership s capital expenditures of million increased by million from million in in  sustaining capital expenditures decreased by million to million principally as a result of a reduction in pipeline and tank integrity capital expenditures of million  which was only partially offset by an increase in operating infrastructure expenditures of million 
the reduction in pipeline and tank integrity expenditures occurred because the partnership completed much of the integrity work required  including electronic internal inspections  other integrity expenditures and associated repairs and improvements  as part of its comprehensive plan to comply with legal requirements and to improve the reliability of the partnership s pipelines and terminals see business environmental matters and business pipeline regulation and safety matters and an increasing amount of the partnership s integrity expenditures were charged to expense in compared to as discussed under critical accounting policies and estimates below  until december   the partnership s initial integrity expenditures have been capitalized as part of pipeline cost when such expenditures improve or extend the life of the pipeline or related assets 
subsequent integrity expenditures have been expensed as incurred 
in  approximately million of integrity expenditures were expensed  compared to million in as of january   the partnership will begin charging all internal inspection integrity expenditures to expense  whether or not such expenditures are the initial or subsequent internal inspection 
the partnership expects to charge million to million of internal integrity expenditures to expense in operating infrastructure expenditures increased to million principally as a result of million of integration expenditures undertaken in connection with the acquisition of the midwest pipelines and terminals in october and the acquisition of the northeast pipelines and terminals in may the partnership does not anticipate significant capital expenditures related to the integration of these assets in expansion and cost reduction capital expenditures were million in  an increase of million from million in the majority of these expenditures related to two major projects
