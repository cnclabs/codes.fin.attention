additionally  we provide management services to two network affiliated stations and one independent television station and two radio stations the managed stations in exchange for a management fee 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
events and other factors that have influenced our results total revenue decreased primarily due to the normal  cyclical decrease of political and olympic revenue 
during  the company was directly affected by hurricane katrina 
we own and operate wdsu tv  the nbc affiliate serving new orleans  louisiana  the nation s rd largest television market 
we estimate that wdsu lost million of revenue during the second half of the year and our stations incurred approximately million in incremental expenses due to the hurricane 
also  we wrote off million of net book value of property  plant and equipment damaged by the storm and recorded a million receivable due from our property insurers  which offset the impact of the loss in the income statement 
we perform our annual review for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements 
due to the negative impact of hurricane katrina and the uncertainty of the future prospects of the new orleans market  we recorded an impairment loss of million to write down wdsu tv s fcc license by million and goodwill by million 
during the year ended december   million in tax benefits were recorded as a result of the settlement of certain tax return examinations and million in tax benefits were recorded as a result of a change in ohio tax law 
in cash increased million over  after capital expenditures  interest and taxes and the funding with cash on hand of a repurchase of million of our senior notes due  the payment of million of dividends to our holders of series a and b common stock and the repurchase of million of series a common stock 
industry trends political advertising decreases in odd numbered years  such as  due to the decrease in the number of candidates running for political office 
revenue from olympic advertising occurs exclusively in even numbered years  such as  with the alternating winter and summer games occurring every two years 
the us congress passed  and the president signed into law  legislation that guides the transition from analog to digital television broadcasting 
a component of this legislation is a deadline of february  for completion of the transition to digital broadcasting and the return of the analog spectrum to the government 
the company estimates that analog equipment having a net book value of approximately million as of december  is affected by the digital conversion 
such equipment was being depreciated over various remaining useful lives  some of which extend to as a result of the new legislation  the equipment will now be depreciated through march  the fcc has permitted broadcast television station licensees to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services such as high definition television programming  audio  data and other types of communication  subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standards 
our station  koat tv in albuquerque  new mexico  currently leases a portion of its digital spectrum to us digital television  llc and eight of our nbc stations currently broadcast the nbc weather plus network  a local and national weather broadcast network  on a multicast stream with their main digital channels 
the fcc is currently considering reducing the restrictions on ownership including newspaper television cross ownership 
these regulations have met opposition from both the public and within the government and may not be ratified 
the lack of clarity concerning ownership rules can reduce our ability to purchase  sell and or swap stations in certain markets 
compensation from networks to their affiliates in exchange for broadcasting of network programming has been sharply reduced in recent years and may be eliminated in the future 
pursuant to the cable television consumer protection and competition act of cable act and the fcc s must carry regulations  cable operators are generally required to devote up to one third of their activated channel capacity to the carriage of the analog signal of local commercial television stations 
we record retransmission income resulting from most of our cable and satellite relationships 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  program rights  barter and trade transactions  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  carrying value of investments  accrued liabilities  contingent liabilities  income taxes  pension benefits  and fair value of financial instruments and stock options 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
had we used different assumptions in determining our estimates  our reported results may have varied 
the different types of estimates that are required to be made by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements vary significantly in the level of subjectivity involved in their determination 
we have identified the estimates below as those which contain a relatively high level of subjectivity in their determination and therefore could have a more material effect upon our reported results if different assumptions were used 
impairment testing of intangible assets in performing our annual impairment testing of goodwill and fcc licenses  which are both considered to be intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  we must make a significant number of assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value based on the present value of future cash flows 
to assist in this process  we utilize the services of an independent valuation consulting firm 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions and estimates required under the impairment testing of goodwill and fcc licenses included future market revenue growth  operating profit margins  cash flow multiples  market revenue share  and weighted average cost of capital  among others 
estimates of future cash flows for our station in new orleans declined significantly from prior year due to the negative impact of hurricane katrina on the new orleans market 
the aggregate book value of fcc licenses exceeded the estimated fair value by million and the company wrote down the book value of fcc licenses accordingly 
after reducing the carrying value of the fcc license  the company compared the carrying value of net assets to the enterprise value 
as a result  the company wrote down million of goodwill 
investment carrying values we have investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which are accounted for under the equity method if our equity interest is from to  and under the cost method if our equity interest is less than and we do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
we review the carrying value of investments on an ongoing basis and adjust them to reflect net realizable value  where necessary 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as part of our analysis and determination of the net realizable value of investments  we must make assumptions and estimates regarding expected future cash flows  which involve assessing the financial results  forecasts  and strategic direction of the investee companies 
in addition  we must make assumptions regarding discount rates  market growth rates  comparable company valuations and other factors  and the types of assumptions we must make differ according to the type of investment to be valued 
had we utilized different assumptions and estimates in our assessment of the net realizable value of investments  the carrying values of our investments as of december  may have been different 
we consider the assumptions used in our determination of investment carrying values to be reasonable 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a million write down to net realizable value of the company s investment in proact technologies corporation proact 
pension assumptions in computing projected benefit obligations and the resulting pension expense  we are required to make a number of assumptions 
to assist in this process  we use the services of an independent consulting firm 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
to compute our projected benefit obligations as of the measurement date of september   we used the discount rate of and a rate of compensation increase of 
in determining the discount rate assumption of  we used a measurement date of september  and constructed a portfolio of bonds to match the benefit payment stream that is projected to be paid from the company s pension plans 
the benefit payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities as well as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio 
to compute our pension expense in the year ended december   we assumed a discount rate of  an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  and a rate of compensation increase of 
to determine the discount rate assumption of  we used the measurement date of september  and used the same methodology to construct a portfolio of bonds to match the projected benefit payment 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption of is based on the weighted average expected long term returns for the target allocation of plan assets as of the measurement date of september  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on management s methodology for developing the expected long term rate of return assumption 
in calculating our pension expense for the year ending december   we anticipate using an assumed expected long term rate of return of 
we consider the assumptions used in our determination of our projected benefit obligations and pension expense to be reasonable 
pension assumptions sensitivity analysis the weighted average assumptions used in computing our net pension expense and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point change in each of the assumptions below would have the following effects upon net pension expense and projected benefit obligation  respectively  in the year ended and as of december  one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return rate of compensation increase discount rate expected long term rate of return rate of compensation increase in thousands net pension expense projected benefit obligation income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the differences in the book and tax bases of certain assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates
