item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following section presents highlight information from management to assist with understanding the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of partners trust financial group  inc  and its subsidiary combined  the company  during the year ended december  and the preceding two years 
the consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k should be read in conjunction with the discussions in this section 
the matters discussed in this section contain certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of statements made that are not historical facts are forward looking and are based on estimates  forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties referred to above include  but are not limited to those described under forward looking statements and risk factors in items and a  respectively of this form k 
highlights and overview the company s results for reflect the first full year of operations following its second step conversion from a mutual holding company to a stock holding company  and its acquisition of bsb bancorp bsb  a billion bank holding company  on july   as more fully discussed in the business section of this form k 
our results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on our loans and securities and our cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for or recovery of loan losses  securities and loan sale activities  loan servicing activities  service charges and fees collected on our deposit accounts  income collected from trust and investment advisory services and the income earned on our investment in bank owned life insurance 
our expenses primarily consist of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expense  marketing expense  technology expense  other expense and income tax expense 
in addition  we had significant expenses in related to the reorganization from a mutual holding company and the bsb acquisition 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particula rly changes in interest rates  inflation  government policies and the actions of regulatory authorities 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  general 
total assets were billion at december   which was million higher than at december  the company s loan portfolio totaled billion at december   an increase of million or compared to billion at december  total deposits increased million and were billion at december  see the sections of this form k titled lending activities loan portfolio composition and sources of funds deposits for further analysis 
shareholders equity decreased from million at december  to million at december   as increases in equity from net income for and the exercise of stock options were offset by share repurchases  dividend payments and a decrease in other comprehensive income  resulting from an increase in the unrealized loss on our securities portfolio due to higher market interest rates 
during  we repurchased million shares of our stock in open market transactions under a stock repurchase plan approved by our board of directors in july  resulting in a million decrease in shareholders equity 
as of december   million shares remain authorized for repurchase under the plan

rate volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and iii net change

net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  which was million  or  higher than the results were positively impacted by the acquisition of bsb and a negative provision for loan losses  while results included acquisition and conversion expenses of million relating to the bsb acquisition 
the million pre tax negative provision for loan losses in  which was recognized in the third quarter  compares with a provision for loan losses of million in the year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of over the million for the same period in the increase in net interest income reflects the full year impact in of the net earning assets acquired from bsb  which was partially offset by a lower net interest margin 
the net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to for the net interest spread for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period in the cost of interest bearing liabilities was for the year ended december   compared with for the same period in  an increase of basis points 
this increase was partially offset by a basis point increase in the yield on earning assets period to period 
the decline in interest rate spread and net interest margin is primarily attributable to the flattening of the yield curve that occurred over the past year  coupled with increased deposit rates in  a larger portion of our deposits being in time accounts and increased borrowings  as discussed in the sources of funds section of this form k 
we could experience further compression in our net interest margin if the current flat yield curve environment continues or if time deposits continue to become a larger portion of our deposit base  which could also cause us to increase rates on savings and money market accounts 
any prolonged inversion of the yield curve resulting from increases in short term interest rates could place additional pressure on our net interest margin as the spread between our short term deposit rates and longer term loan rates narrows further 
provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level management considers necessary to absorb probable credit losses in the current loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or later events occur 
management assesses the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and makes provisions for loan losses in order to increase the allowance 
we recorded a negative provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  compared with a million provision for loan losses in non performing loans to total loans were and  at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans and to total loans was and  respectively  at december   compared to and  respectively  at december  it is probable that a provision for loan losses will be necessary in future quarters if we are successful in implementing our loan growth strategy  particularly as it relates to commercial and consumer loans  which inherently are a higher credit risk than residential mortgage loans  or if loan delinquencies increase from current levels  among other factors 
the asset quality section of this form k provides further information on the methodology used in determining the allowance for loan losses and loan loss pr ovisions 
non interest income 
the following table summarizes changes in the major components of non interest income dollars in thousands change change service fees trust and investment services income from bank owned life insurance other than temporary impairment of securities net gain loss on sale of securities available for sale net gain on sale of loans other income total non interest income service fees and trust and investment services income showed similar percentage increases in resulting primarily from the full year impact of the bsb acquisition  due to the increased customer base from which these revenues are derived 
income from bank owned life insurance increased due primarily to the policies acquired from bsb 
an other than temporary impairment charge of million was recorded in on variable rate perpetual preferred stock issued by fannie mae 
there were no such writedowns in non interest expense 
the following table summarizes changes in the major components of non interest expense dollars in thousands change change salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment expense marketing expense professional services technology expense amortization of intangible assets acquisition and conversion expenses other expense total non interest expense the increase in non interest expense from to is due primarily to the full year impact of operating a much larger company  and to a full year of amortization of intangible assets that arose from the bsb acquisition  partially offset by the acquisition and conversion expenses incurred in the increase in salaries and employee benefits reflects the higher employment level of the merged company 
the number of full time and part time employees increased to and  respectively  at december  from and  respectively  immediately prior to the bsb acquisition 
the company s branch network grew from to with the acquisition of bsb  and occupancy and equipment expense increased accordingly 
marketing expense increased  in due to our larger geographic presence and increased business development efforts 
furthermore  greater emphasis was placed on advertising in our markets in an effort to increase our brand recognition 
professional services increased million in  due to a  increase in legal expenses relating primarily to commercial loan collection activities  a  increase in audit and accounting fees reflecting our larger size and increased regulatory compliance costs  and to a higher level of other professional services attributable to the company s larger size 
technology expense increased due to the increased data processing cost associated with running a bank with a much larger customer base that offers a wider variety or products and services 
we added approximately  customer accounts as a result of the bsb acquisition  representing an increase in our customer accounts of approximately 
amortization of intangible assets increased million due to a full year of amortization on the core deposit and trust intangible assets related to the bsb acquisition 
acquisition and conversion expenses of million incurred in were attributable to the bsb acquisition 
other expense increased in due primarily to the growth in the size of the company  and included increases in postage  telephone  and insurance  expenses 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million on income before taxes of million for the year ended december   resulting in an effective tax rate of compared to income tax expense of million on income before taxes of million for  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the levels of tax expense generally fluctuates with the respective levels of income before income taxes 
the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributed to the recapture of new york state bad debt reserves  as discussed in the taxation section of this form k  resulting in additional state tax expense of  net of federal benefit  and the smaller relative contribution of tax advantaged income to pre tax income in comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  which was million  or lower than the same period in the decrease was primarily due to acquisition and conversion expenses of million pre tax and an after tax charge of million for other than temporary impairment of securities  which offset additional income realized from the growth in earning assets acquired in the bsb acquisition 
net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of over the million for the same period in the increase in net interest income reflected the substantial increase in net earning assets acquired from bsb 
the low interest rate environment in  however  negatively affected our asset yields  and we were not able to reduce our cost of funds to the same degree due to the already low rates paid on our deposit accounts and competitive pressures 
as a result  our interest rate spread and net interest margin were reduced in the bsb acquisition also had a negative impact on our interest rate spread and net interest margin 
the average yield on total loans acquired from bsb was below that of the company before the acquisition and bsb s cost of funds was also higher 
this  in conjunction with the net earning assets of bsb being approximately twice as large as that of the company at the time of the acquisition  resulted in a significant reduction of our margin 
by way of comparison  our net interest margin for the last full quarter prior to the acquisition was  versus a net interest margin of for bsb 
furthermore  our net interest margin was negatively impacted by amortization of the market value adjustments recorded in the acquisition premiums and discounts on loans  securities  deposits  and borrowings 
a reduction of million in net interest income was recorded in representing the net amortization of these market value adjustments 
this corresponded to an basis point reduction in net interest margin in the net interest spread for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period in the net interest margin for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities was for the year ended december   compared with for the same period in  a reduction of basis points 
this reduction was not sufficient to offset the basis point reduction in the yield on earning assets period to period 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in non performing loans to total loans were and  at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans and to total loans increased to and  respectively  at december  from and  respectively  at december  non interest income 
the following table summarizes changes in the major components of non interest income dollars in thousands change change service fees trust and investment services income from bank owned life insurance other than temporary impairment of securities n a net loss on sale of securities available for sale n a net gain on sale of loans other income total non interest income the increase in service fees from to is primarily attributed to an increase in deposit accounts  deposit products and new products offered as a result of the bsb acquisition 
trust and investment services income increased  due primarily to the increase of approximately million in trust assets under management and an increase in the sale of non deposit investment products resulting from the bsb acquisition 
the increase of  on income from bank owned life insurance is primarily attributable to the policies acquired from bsb 
an other than temporary impairment writedown of million was recorded on variable rate perpetual preferred stock issued by fannie mae with an aggregate face value of million  as these securities had a market value below their book value for a sustained period of time 
the decrease in net gain on sale of loans is primarily attributable to the  gain recognized in on the sale of agricultural loans as we sought to exit this business line 
non interest expense 
the following table summarizes changes in the major components of non interest expense dollars in thousands change change salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment expense marketing expense professional services technology expense amortization of intangible assets acquisition and conversion expenses n a other expense total non interest expense the increase in non interest expense from to is due in large part to the impact of operating a much larger company  as similarly discussed in the comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and non interest expense section of this form k 
increases in costs associated with the acquisition of bsb  including amortization of intangible assets  also affected non interest expense in income tax expense 
income tax expense was million on income before taxes of million for the year ended december   resulting in an effective tax rate of compared to income tax expense of million on income before taxes of million for  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the levels of tax expense generally fluctuates with the respective levels of income before income taxes 
the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily attributed to the higher ratio of tax exempt income to income before taxes 
supplemental reporting of non gaap results of operations 
in addition to results presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we are providing in this report certain non gaap financial measures 
we believe that providing certain non gaap financial measures provides the reader with information useful in understanding our financial performance  our performance trends and financial position 
specifically  we provide measures based on what we believe are our core operating earnings 
core operating earnings is net income as reported on a gaap basis  adjusted to exclude large non cash items which affect the reporting of results of operations  such as net amortization of fair market value adjustments on net assets acquired in mergers  amortization of intangibles and covenant not to compete expense  and the negative provision for loan losses 
additionally  we exclude acquisition and conversion expenses 
we believe these items are not reflective o f on going operations and are therefore nonoperating in nature 
we consider loan loss provisions to be a normal operating expense and therefore they are not added back when calculating our core earnings 
we utilize core operating earnings  along with other factors  to evaluate ongoing operating performance for internal planning and forecasting purposes 
we  as well as securities analysts  investors and other interested parties  also use this measure as a tool to compare peer company operating performance 
we believe that our presentation and discussion of core operating earnings  together with the accompanying reconciliations  provides a complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business and allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to management 
we also believe that the adjustments we use to calculate core operating earnings remove the effects of factors that are not representative of our ongoing operations and otherwise distort trends in underlying operating results 
while some of these items may have occurred historically and may be considered to be recurring items for gaap purposes  occurrence in future periods is dependent upon future business an d economic factors  including for example  the ability to identify and execute on further acquisition transactions  as well as other evaluation criteria 
these factors are often frequently beyond the control of company management 
these non gaap measures should not be considered a substitute for gaap basis measures and results and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 
because non gaap financial measures are not standardized  it may not be possible to compare this financial measure with other companies non gaap financial measures having the same or similar names 
our core operating earnings rose to million or per diluted share in  compared to million or per diluted share in and million or per diluted share in the following table reconciles core operating earnings to net income in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  in thousands  except per share data net income as reported gaap adjustments net amortization of premium on net assets acquired in mergers other than temporary impairment on securities acquisition and conversion expense amortization of core deposit trust intangibles covenant not to compete expense negative provision for loan loss total adjustments pre tax related income taxes total adjustments after tax core operating earnings diluted eps using core operating earnings the following table sets forth certain gaap and non gaap performance ratios year ended december  return on average assets using gaap earnings using core operating earnings return on average equity using gaap earnings using core operating earnings return on average tangible equity using gaap earnings using core operating earnings efficiency ratio using gaap earnings using core operating earnings averages are daily averages 
represents the ratio of non interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non interest income  excluding gains or losses on the sale of securities and loans 
impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increasing cost of our operations 
unlike those of most industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are nearly all monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or to the same extent  as the price of goods and services 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by us for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding 
for the year ended december   we engaged in no off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to maintain cash flows that are adequate to fund our operations and meet our obligations and other commitments on a timely and cost effective basis 
our liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of funds management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  various forms of both short and long term borrowings provide an additional source of funds 
liquidity management at the bank focuses on its ability to generate sufficient cash to meet the funding needs of current loan demand  deposit withdrawals  principal and interest payments with respect to outstanding borrowings and to pay operating expenses 
it is the bank s policy to maintain greater liquidity than required in order to be in a position to fund loan originations and investments 
the bank monitors its liquidity in accordance with guidelines established by its board of directors and applicable regulatory requirements 
the bank s need for liquidity is affected by its loan activity  net changes in deposit levels and the scheduled maturities of its borrowings 
liquidity demand resulting from net reductions in deposits is usually caused by factors over which the bank has limited control 
the principal sources of the bank s liquidity consist of deposits including brokered time deposits  interest and principal payments and prepayments  its ability to sell assets at market price s and its ability to pledge its unencumbered assets as collateral for additional borrowings  advances from the fhlb of new york and reverse repurchase agreements 
at december   the bank had billion in available fhlb borrowing capacity  of which million was outstanding 
at december   the bank had outstanding commitments including undisbursed loan principal balances to originate loans of million 
certificates of deposit which are scheduled to mature within one year totaled million  excluding purchase accounting adjustments  at december   and borrowings that are scheduled to mature within the same period amounted to million excluding purchase accounting adjustments  at such date 
deposit flows are affected by the level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by competitors and other factors 
based on our deposit retention experience we anticipate that a majority of the time deposits maturing within the next year will be retained  though increased competitive pressures have resulted in increased outflows  which may continue 
we are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position and monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis 
if deposit outflow increases beyond reasonable levels  we will readjust our deposit pricing strategy or take other measures  such as discontinuing our reinvestment of security payments or increasing our reliance on wholesale funding sources  such as brokered time deposits or borrowings  to ensure ample liquidity 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments  though it is possible that our reliance on wholesale funds will increase in the current competitive and interest rate environments  resulting in further upward pressure on our overall cost of funds 
liquidity management at the holding company focuses on generating sufficient cash flow to pay dividends to common stockholders  execute authorized share repurchases and to make interest payments on the junior subordinated obligations 
at december   the total interest payments due in on the junior subordinated obligations amounts to approximately million in the aggregate  based on the applicable interest rate at that date 
the company s primary sources of funds are net proceeds from capital offerings  dividends from the bank and investment income 
at december   the company had million of cash and securities available for sale at the holding company level 
under ots capital distribution regulations  the bank may pay dividends to the company without prior regulatory approval so long as the bank meets its applicable regulatory capital requirements before and after payment of the dividends and its total dividends do not exceed its net income to date over the calendar year plus retained net income over the preceding two years 
the ots has discretion to prohibit any otherwise permissible capital distributions on general safety and soundness grounds  and must be given days advance notice of all capital distributions 
at december   the bank had the ability to pay dividends of million to the company without the prior approval of the ots 
on july   the company announced that its board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of its outstanding common stock 
management will use its discretion in determining the timing of the repurchases and the prices at which buybacks will be made 
the extent to which shares are repurchased will depend on a number of factors including market trends and prices  economic conditions  internal and regulatory trading quiet periods and alternative uses for capital 
the repurchase program is authorized for up to one year  and there can be no assurance that the company will repurchase all million shares authorized 
the primary source of funding for the repurchase program will be dividends available for payment by the bank to the company 
as of december   million shares were purchased at a total cost of million 
we do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for the foreseeable future  nor do we have any balloon payments due on any long term obligations other than scheduled maturities  although million of fhlb advances at december  can be called by the fhlb at quarterly intervals 
these callable advances  with a weighted average interest rate of  mature in if called  we have the option to reprice the advances at the then current fhlb rates  or to repay the advances 
at december   the bank exceeded all the applicable regulatory capital requirements 
although the office of thrift supervision does not impose minimum capital requirements on thrift holding companies  our consolidated regulatory capital amounts and ratios are discussed below 
the company s consolidated and the bank s leverage tier capital at december  was million and million  respectively  or and of assets  respectively 
in order to be classified as well capitalized under federal banking regulations  the bank was required to have leverage tier capital of at least million  or of assets 
to be classified as a well capitalized bank  the bank must also have a ratio of total risk based capital to risk weighted assets of at least 
at december   the bank s total risk based capital ratio was critical accounting policies management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required for probable credit losses and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
management also considers the accounting policy relating to the test for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets to be a critical accounting policy due to the subjectivity and judgment involved and the material effect an impairment loss could have on the results of operations 
our policies on the allowance for loan losses and goodwill and intangible assets are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a more detailed description of our methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is included in the asset quality section in part  item of this report 
all accounting policies are important  and as such  we encourage the reade r to review each of the policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements to obtain a better understanding of how our financial performance is reported

this statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amou nt equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
excess tax benefits  as defined by this statement  will be recognized as an addition to paid in capital

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk qualitative analysi s 
because the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
we are vulnerable to an increase in interest rates to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or re price more rapidly than interest earning assets 
the primary objective of our interest rate risk policy is to manage the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
we actively monitor interest rate risk in connection with our lending  investing  deposit and borrowing activities 
we do not hold any of our assets for trading purposes 
as discussed in the comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and section of this form k  our net interest margin decreased in we could see further compression in our net interest margin if the current flat yield curve environment continues or if competition for deposits continues  which would drive up the cost of retaining or attracting deposits 
furthermore  any prolonged inversion of the yield curve resulting from increases in short term interest rates could place additional pressure on our net interest margin as the spread between our short term deposit rates and our longer term loan rates narrows further 
quantitative analysis 
our interest rate sensitivity is monitored through the use of a net interest income simulation model  which generates estimates of the change in our net interest income over a range of interest rate scenarios 
the model assumes loan prepayment rates  reinvestment rates and deposit decay rates based on historical experience and current conditions 
the following table sets forth the result of our net interest income simulation model as of december  and change in interest in basis points annual net interest income annual net interest income rate ramp amount change change amount change change dollars in thousands flat in the event of an instantaneous basis point increase in interest rates across the yield curve  we estimate that we would experience a  or million  decrease in net interest income 
in the event of an instantaneous basis point decrease in interest rates across the yield curve  we estimate that we would experience a  or  increase in net interest income 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
while we believe such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity 
moreover  the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the net interest income table provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
