item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contractual obligations for disclosure of approximate aggregate amount of principal indebtedness scheduled to mature 
we and mission could also incur additional debt in the future 
the terms of our and mission s senior credit facilities  as well as the indentures governing our publicly held notes  limit  but do not prohibit us or mission from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt 
to the extent we or mission incur additional debt  we would become even more susceptible to the leverage related risks described above 
the agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our management s discretion in the operation of our business 
our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our publicly held notes contain various covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things incur additional debt and issue preferred stock  pay dividends and make other distributions  make investments and other restricted payments  merge  consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create liens  sell assets or stock of our subsidiaries  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
in addition  our senior credit facility requires us to maintain or meet certain financial ratios  including consolidated leverage ratios and interest coverage ratios 
future financing agreements may contain similar  or even more restrictive  provisions and covenants 
as a result of these restrictions and covenants  our 
table of contents management s ability to operate our business at its discretion is limited  and we may be unable to compete effectively  pursue acquisitions or take advantage of new business opportunities  any of which could harm our business 
mission s senior credit facility contains similar terms and restrictions 
if we fail to comply with the restrictions in present or future financing agreements  a default may occur 
a default could allow creditors to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies 
a default could also allow creditors to foreclose on any collateral securing such debt 
mission may make decisions regarding the operation of its stations that could reduce the amount of cash we receive under our local service agreements 
mission is owned by an independent third party 
mission owns and operates television stations 
we have entered into various local service agreements with mission  pursuant to which we provide services to mission s stations 
in return for the services we provide  we receive substantially all of the available cash  after payment of debt service costs  generated by mission s stations 
we also guarantee all of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility  which were incurred primarily in connection with mission s acquisition of its stations 
in addition  the sole shareholder of mission has granted to us a purchase option to acquire the assets and liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent  for consideration equal to the greater of seven times the station s broadcast cash flow  as defined in the option agreement  less the amount of its indebtedness as defined in the option agreement or the amount of its indebtedness 
we do not own mission or mission s television stations 
however we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in them under us gaap 
in order for our arrangements with mission under the local service agreements to comply with fcc regulations  mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming  finances  personnel and operations of its stations 
as a result  mission s sole shareholder and officers can make decisions with which we disagree and which could reduce the cash flow generated by these stations and  as a consequence  the amounts we receive under our local service agreements with mission 
for instance  we may disagree with mission s programming decisions  which programming may prove unpopular and or may generate less advertising revenue 
furthermore  subject to mission s agreement with its lenders  mission s sole shareholder could choose to pay himself a dividend 
the revenue generated by stations we operate or provide services to could decline substantially if they fail to maintain or renew their network affiliation agreements on favorable terms  or at all 
due to the quality of the programming provided by the networks  stations that are affiliated with a network generally have higher ratings than unaffiliated independent stations in the same market 
as a result  it is important for stations to maintain their network affiliations 
except for kcpn lp  all of the stations we operate or provide services to have network affiliation agreements twelve stations have primary affiliation agreements with nbc  eight with cbs  nine with abc  thirteen with fox and three with upn 
each of nbc  cbs and abc generally provides affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week  while each of fox and upn provides affiliated stations with up to hours of prime time programming per week 
in return  affiliated stations broadcast the respective network s commercials during the network programming 
under the affiliation agreements with nbc  cbs and abc  most of the stations we operate or provide services to also receive compensation from these networks 
all of the network affiliation agreements of the stations that we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to are scheduled to expire at various times beginning in june through december  except for one network affiliation agreement which can be terminated upon days prior written notice by the network 
network affiliation agreements are also subject to earlier termination by the networks under limited circumstances 
for more information regarding these network affiliation agreements  see business network affiliations 

table of contents on january   the owners of upn and wb announced the two television networks will merge to form a new network called the cw 
we and mission operate three upn affiliated stations located in wichita falls  texas  champaign  illinois  and utica  new york 
nexstar and mission do not believe that the loss of any of these stations affiliation agreements would have a material impact on revenue 
the fcc could decide not to grant renewal of the fcc license of any of the stations we operate or provide services to which would require that station to cease operations 
television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the fcc 
the fcc is required to grant an application for license renewal if during the preceding term the station served the public interest  the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules  and the licensee committed no other violations of the communications act or the fcc s rules which  taken together  would constitute a pattern of abuse 
a majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard 
if a licensee fails to meet this standard the fcc may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate  including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight year period 
on october   the director of the central illinois chapter of the parents television council ptc submitted an informal objection to the application for renewal of license for nexstar s station  wcia  champaign  illinois  requesting the fcc withhold action on wcia s license renewal application until the fcc acts on the ptc s complaint regarding an allegedly indecent broadcast on wcia 
on january   cable america corporation submitted a petition to deny the applications for renewal of license for nexstar s station  ksfx  and mission s station  kolr  both licensed to springfield  missouri 
cable america has alleged that nexstar s local service agreements with mission give nexstar improper control over mission s operations 
nexstar and mission submitted a joint opposition to this petition to deny and cable america submitted a reply 
nexstar and mission began to submit renewal of license applications for their stations beginning in june and will continue to do so through april we and mission expect the fcc to renew the licenses for our stations in due course 
the loss of the services of our chief executive officer could disrupt management of our business and impair the execution of our business strategies 
we believe that our success depends upon our ability to retain the services of perry a 
sook  our founder and president and chief executive officer 
mr 
sook has been instrumental in determining our strategic direction and focus 
the loss of mr 
sook s services could adversely affect our ability to manage effectively our overall operations and successfully execute current or future business strategies 
our growth may be limited if we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy 
we intend to continue our growth by selectively pursuing acquisitions of television stations 
the television broadcast industry is undergoing consolidation  which may reduce the number of acquisition targets and increase the purchase price of future acquisitions 
some of our competitors may have greater financial or management resources with which to pursue acquisition targets 
therefore  even if we are successful in identifying attractive acquisition targets  we may face considerable competition and our acquisition strategy may not be successful 
fcc rules and policies may also make it more difficult for us to acquire or enter into local service agreements with additional television stations 
television station acquisitions are subject to the approval of the fcc and  potentially  other regulatory authorities 
the need for fcc and other regulatory approvals could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions if  for example  the fcc or other government agencies believe that 
table of contents a proposed transaction would result in excessive concentration in a market  even if the proposed combinations may otherwise comply with fcc ownership limitations 
growing our business through acquisitions involves risks and if we are unable to manage effectively our rapid growth  our operating results will suffer 
we have experienced rapid growth 
since january   we have more than doubled the number of stations that we own  operate  program or provide sales and other services to  having acquired stations and contracted to provide service to additional stations 
we will continue to actively pursue additional acquisition opportunities 
to manage effectively our growth and address the increased reporting requirements and administrative demands that will result from future acquisitions  we will need  among other things  to continue to develop our financial and management controls and management information systems 
we will also need to continue to identify  attract and retain highly skilled finance and management personnel 
failure to do any of these tasks in an efficient and timely manner could seriously harm our business 
there are other risks associated with growing our business through acquisitions 
for example  with any past or future acquisition  there is the possibility that we may not be able to successfully reduce costs  increase advertising revenue or audience share or realize anticipated synergies and economies of scale with respect to any acquired station  an acquisition may increase our leverage and debt service requirements or may result in our assuming unexpected liabilities  our management may be reassigned from overseeing existing operations by the need to integrate the acquired business  we may experience difficulties integrating operations and systems  as well as  company policies and cultures  we may fail to retain and assimilate employees of the acquired business  and problems may arise in entering new markets in which we have little or no experience 
the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  particularly during the period immediately following any acquisition 
fcc actions may restrict our ability to create duopolies under local service agreements  which would harm our existing operations and impair our acquisition strategy 
we have created duopolies in some of our markets by entering into what we refer to as local service agreements 
while these agreements take varying forms  a typical local service agreement is an agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market  whereby the owner of one station provides operational assistance to the other station  subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter station s owner 
by operating or entering into local service agreements with more than one station in a market  we achieve significant operational efficiencies  broaden our audience reach and enhance our ability to capture more advertising spending in a given market 
while all of our existing local service agreements comply with fcc rules and policies  we cannot assure you that the fcc will continue to permit local service agreements as a means of creating duopoly type opportunities 
on august   the fcc initiated a rule making proceeding to determine whether to make tv joint sales agreements attributable under its ownership rules 
comments and reply comments were filed in this proceeding in the fourth quarter of the fcc has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding 
however  if the fcc adopts a jsa attribution rule for tv stations we will be required to comply with the rule 

table of contents cable america corporation has alleged that nexstar s local service agreements with mission give nexstar improper control over mission s operations 
on january   cable america corporation submitted a petition to deny the applications for renewal of license for nexstar s station  ksfx  and mission s station  kolr  both licensed to springfield  missouri 
nexstar and mission submitted a joint opposition to this petition to deny and cable america submitted a reply 
if the fcc challenges our existing arrangements with mission or our similar arrangements with sinclair broadcasting group  inc based on this complaint and determines that our arrangements violate the fcc s rules or policies  we may be required to terminate such arrangements and we could be subject to sanctions  fines and or other penalties 
the fcc may decide to terminate grandfathered time brokerage agreements 
the fcc currently attributes toward the local television ownership limits in market stations when one station owner programs a second in market station pursuant to a time brokerage agreement or local marketing agreement tba  if the programmer provides more than percent of the second station s weekly broadcast programming 
however  tbas entered into prior to november  are exempt attributable interests for now 
the fcc will review these grandfathered tbas in the future 
during this review  the fcc may determine to terminate the grandfathered period and make all tbas fully attributable to the programmer 
if the fcc does so  we and mission will be required to terminate the tbas for stations wfxp and khmt  unless the fcc simultaneously changes its duopoly rules to allow ownership of two stations in the applicable markets 
failure to construct full power dtv facilities may lead to a loss of station coverage area or other fcc sanctions 
fcc regulations required all commercial television stations in the united states to commence digital operations on a schedule determined by the fcc and congress  in addition to continuing their analog operations 
all of the television stations we and mission own and operate are broadcasting at least a low power digital television signal  except for knwa  for which we have filed a request for extension of time with the fcc 
when the fcc acts on the extension request  we will have at least six months to complete construction of knwa s dtv facilities 
if knwa is not broadcasting a digital signal by the end of this six month period we could be subject to sanctions  including  eventually  loss of the dtv construction permit 
digital transmissions were initially permitted to be low power  but full power transmission was required by july  for stations affiliated with the four largest networks abc  cbs  nbc and fox in the top one hundred markets and is required by july  for all other stations 
we have filed a request for extension of time to construct full power dtv facilities for our top four affiliates in the top one hundred market stations 
mission also has filed a request for such extension for its top four affiliates in the top one hundred market stations 
the fcc has not yet acted on these requests for extension of time 
for each of the stations we and mission own and operate that do not obtain an extension of time and are not broadcasting a full power digital signal by the deadlines set by the fcc  such station may lose its interference protection  which could have a material adverse effect on the station 
the level of foreign investments held by our principal stockholder  abry partners  llc and its affiliated funds abry  may limit additional foreign investments made in us 
the communications act limits the extent of non us ownership of companies that own us broadcast stations 
under this restriction  a us broadcast company such as ours may have no more than non us ownership by vote and by equity 
because our majority shareholder  abry has a substantial level of foreign investment  the amount of additional foreign investment that may be made in us is limited to approximately percent of our total outstanding equity 

table of contents the interest of our principal stockholder  abry  in other media may limit our ability to acquire television stations in particular markets  restricting our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
the number of television stations we may acquire in any market is limited by fcc rules and may vary depending upon whether the interests in other television stations or other media properties of persons affiliated with us are attributable under fcc rules 
the broadcast or other media interest of our officers  directors and stockholders with or greater voting power are generally attributable under the fcc s rules  which may limit us from acquiring or owning television stations in particular markets while those officers  directors or stockholders are associated with us 
in addition  the holder of otherwise non attributable equity and or debt in a licensee in excess of of the total debt and equity of the licensee will be attributable where the holder is either a major program supplier to that licensee or the holder has an attributable interest in another broadcast station  cable system or daily newspaper in the same market 
abry  our principal stockholder  is one of the largest private firms specializing in media and broadcasting investments 
as a result of abry s interest in us  we could be prevented from acquiring broadcast companies in markets where abry has an attributable interest in television stations or other media  which could impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy 
our certificate of incorporation allows abry and its affiliates to identify  pursue and consummate additional acquisitions of television stations or other broadcast related businesses that may be complementary to our business and therefore such acquisitions opportunities may not be available to us 
we are controlled by one principal stockholder  abry  and its interests may differ from your interests 
as a result of abry s controlling interest in us  abry is able to exercise a controlling influence over our business and affairs 
abry is able to unilaterally determine the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders  including the election and removal of directors and the approval of any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  five of our directors are or were affiliated with abry 
abry s interests may differ from the interests of other security holders and abry could take actions or make decisions that are not in the best interests of our security holders 
furthermore  this concentration of ownership by abry may have the effect of impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares 
our certification of incorporation  bylaws  debt instruments and delaware law contain anti takeover protections that may discourage or prevent a takeover of us  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law  could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us  even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock by our board of directors without a stockholder vote  do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  and set forth specific advance notice procedures for matters to be raised at stockholder meetings 
the delaware general corporation law prohibits us from engaging in business combinations with interested shareholders with some exceptions unless such transaction is approved in a prescribed manner 
the existence of this provision could have an anti takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors  including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock 

table of contents in addition  a change in control would be an event of default under our senior credit facility and trigger the rights of holders of our publicly traded notes to cause us to repurchase such notes 
these events would add to the cost of an acquisition  which could deter a third party from acquiring us 
we and mission have a history of net losses 
we and mission had aggregate net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we and mission may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
we and mission have a material amount of goodwill and intangible assets  therefore the company could suffer losses due to future asset impairment charges 
as of december   approximately million  or  of our and mission s combined total assets consisted of goodwill and intangible assets  including fcc licenses and network affiliation agreements 
we and mission test goodwill and fcc licenses annually  and on an interim date if factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test of these assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we and mission test network affiliation agreements whenever circumstances or indicators become apparent the asset may not be recoverable through expected future cash flows 
the methods used to evaluate the impairment of the of the company s goodwill and intangible assets would be affected by a significant reduction in operating results or cash flows at one or more of the company s television stations  or a forecast of such reductions  a significant adverse change in the advertising marketplaces in which the company s television stations operate  the loss of network affiliations  or by adverse changes to fcc ownership rules  among others  which may be beyond our or mission s control 
if the carrying amount of goodwill and intangibles assets is revised downward due to impairment  such non cash charge could materially affect the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
on january   the owners of upn and wb announced that the two television networks will merge to form a new network called the cw 
we and mission operate upn affiliated stations located in wichita falls  texas  champaign  illinois  and utica  new york 
we and mission are currently evaluating the impact the merger will have on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
risks related to our industry nexstar s operating results are dependent on advertising revenue and as a result  nexstar may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and other factors beyond nexstar s control than businesses not dependent on advertising 
nexstar derives revenue primarily from the sale of advertising time 
nexstar s ability to sell advertising time depends on numerous factors that may be beyond nexstar s control  including the health of the economy in the local markets where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole  the popularity of our programming  fluctuations in pricing for local and national advertising  the activities of our competitors  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based media  particularly newspapers  cable television  internet and radio  the decreased demand for political advertising in non election years  and changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located 
because businesses generally reduce their advertising budgets during economic recessions or downturns  the reliance upon advertising revenue makes nexstar s operating results particularly susceptible to prevailing 
table of contents economic conditions 
we also cannot assure you that our programming will attract sufficient targeted viewership or that we will achieve favorable ratings 
our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control  such as viewer preferences  competing programming and the availability of other entertainment activities 
a shift in viewer preferences could cause our programming not to gain popularity or to decline in popularity  which could cause our advertising revenue to decline 
in addition  we and the programming providers upon which we rely may not be able to anticipate  and effectively react to  shifts in viewer tastes and interests in our markets 
because a high percentage of our operating expenses are fixed  a relatively small decrease in advertising revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
our business is characterized generally by high fixed costs  primarily for debt service  broadcast rights and personnel 
other than commissions paid to our sales staff and outside sales agencies  our expenses do not vary significantly with the increase or decrease in advertising revenue 
as a result  a relatively small change in advertising prices could have a disproportionate effect on our financial results 
accordingly  a minor shortfall in expected revenue could have a significant negative impact on our financial results 
preemption of regularly scheduled programming by network news coverage may affect our revenue and results of operations 
nexstar may experience a loss of advertising revenue and incur additional broadcasting expenses due to preemption of our regularly scheduled programming by network coverage of a major global news event such as a war or terrorist attack 
as a result  advertising may not be aired and the revenue for such advertising may be lost unless the broadcasting station is able to run the advertising at agreed upon times in the future 
there can be no assurance that advertisers will agree to run such advertising in future time periods or that space will be available for such advertising 
we cannot predict the duration of such preemption of local programming if it occurs 
in addition  our stations and the stations we provide services to may incur additional expenses as a result of expanded news coverage of the local impact of a war or terrorist attack 
the loss of revenue and increased expenses could negatively affect our results of operations 
the industry wide mandatory conversion to digital television will require us to make significant capital expenditures without assurance that we will remain competitive with other developing technologies 
it will be expensive to convert from the current analog broadcast format to the digital broadcast format 
this conversion required an average initial capital expenditure of approximately million per station for low power transmission of digital signal programming  and we estimate that it will require an average additional capital expenditure of approximately million per station for stations to modify our and mission s stations dtv transmitters for full power digital signal transmission  including costs for the transmitter  transmission line  antenna and installation  and estimated costs for tower upgrades and or modifications 
digital conversion expenditures were million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and stations that fail to meet the fcc s build out deadlines  and that have not received an extension of time from the fcc  will lose interference protection for their signals outside their low power coverage areas 
as of december   mission s stations wutr  wtvo and wyou are transmitting full power digital signals and nexstar s station wbre is transmitting a full power digital signal 
since digital technology allows broadcasting of multiple channels within the additional allocated spectrum  this technology could expose us to additional competition from programming alternatives 
technological advancements and the resulting increase in programming alternatives such as cable television  dbs systems  pay per view  home video and entertainment systems  video on demand and the internet have created new types of competition to television broadcast stations and will also increase competition for household audiences and advertisers 

table of contents if direct broadcast satellite companies do not carry the stations that we own and operate or provide services to  we could lose audience share and revenue 
the satellite home viewer extension and reauthorization act allows direct broadcast satellite television companies to continue to transmit local broadcast television signals to subscribers in local markets provided that they offer to carry all local stations in that market 
however  satellite providers have limited satellite capacity to deliver local station signals in local markets 
satellite providers  such as directv and echostar  carry our and mission s stations in only some of our markets and may choose not to carry local stations in any of our other markets 
directv currently provides satellite carriage of our and mission s stations in the champaign springfield decatur  evansville  ft 
smith fayetteville springdale rogers  ft 
wayne  little rock pine bluff  peoria bloomington  rochester  shreveport  springfield and wilkes barre scranton markets

in those markets in which the satellite providers do not carry local station signals  subscribers to those satellite services are unable to view local stations without making further arrangements  such as installing antennas and switches 
furthermore  when direct broadcast satellite companies do carry local television stations in a market  they are permitted to charge subscribers extra for such service 
some subscribers may choose not to pay extra to receive local television stations 
in the event subscribers to satellite services do not receive the stations that we own and operate or provide services to  we could lose audience share which would adversely affect our revenue and earnings 
if we are unable to reach retransmission consent agreements with cable companies for the carriage of our stations signals  we could lose audience share and revenue 
the communications act grants television broadcasters retransmission consent rights in connection with the carriage of their stations signal by cable companies 
if a broadcaster chooses to exercise retransmission consent rights  a cable television system which is subject to that election may not carry a station s signal without the broadcaster s consent 
this generally requires the cable system operator and the television broadcaster to negotiate the terms under which the broadcaster will consent to the cable system s carriage of its station s signal 
we and mission have elected to exercise retransmission consent rights for all of our stations where we have a legal right to do so 
we and mission have negotiated retransmission consent agreements with substantially all of the cable systems which carry the stations signals 
the fcc can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations which it finds to be indecent 
in  the fcc imposed substantial fines on television broadcasters for the broadcast of indecent material in violation of the communications act and its rules 
the fcc also revised its indecency review analysis to more strictly prohibit the use of certain language on broadcast television 
because our and mission s stations programming is in large part comprised of programming provided by the networks with which the stations are affiliated  we and mission do not have full control over what is broadcast on our stations  and we and mission may be subject to the imposition of fines if the fcc finds such programming to be indecent 
in addition  congress currently is considering legislation that will substantially increase the maximum amount the fcc can fine broadcasters for the broadcast of indecent programming and may consider permitting the fcc to institute license revocation proceedings against any station which repeatedly violates the indecency regulations 
intense competition in the television industry could limit our growth and impair our ability to become profitable 
as a television broadcasting company  we face a significant level of competition  both directly and indirectly 
generally we compete for our audience against all the other leisure activities in which one could choose to engage 
table of contents in rather than watch television 
specifically  stations we own or provide services to compete for audience share  programming and advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and with other advertising media  including newspapers  radio stations  cable television  dbs systems and the internet 
the entertainment industry  and particularly the television industry  are highly competitive and are undergoing a period of consolidation 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  marketing  programming and broadcasting resources than we do 
the markets in which we operate are also in a constant state of change arising from  among other things  technological improvements and economic and regulatory developments 
technological innovation and the resulting proliferation of television entertainment  such as cable television  wireless cable  satellite to home distribution services  pay per view and home video and entertainment systems  have fractionalized television viewing audiences and have subjected free over the air television broadcast stations to increased competition 
we may not be able to compete effectively or adjust our business plans to meet changing market conditions 
we are unable to predict what form of competition will develop in the future  the extent of the competition or its possible effects on our businesses 
in addition  on february   the us court of appeals for the us circuit directed the fcc to repeal in its entirety the local television cable cross ownership rule  which prohibits any cable television system from carrying the signal of any television broadcast station with a predicted service area that overlaps  in whole or in part  the cable system s service area  if the cable system or any of its attributable principals has an attributable interest in the television station 
as a result of such repeal  cable systems and co located television stations now may be commonly owned 
this means that the operator of a cable system that carries one of the stations we own or provide services to could become the owner of a competing station in the market 
on june   the fcc eliminated its radio television cross ownership rule and its local television newspaper cross ownership rule  replacing both with a new single cross media ownership rule 
under this new rule  a daily newspaper  under certain circumstances  may be able to own a television station in the same market 
this means that the owner of a local newspaper could become the owner of a competing station in the market 
however  this rule did not become effective and  on june   a three judge panel of the us court of appeals for the third circuit remanded the rule back to the fcc for further consideration 
for more information about this rule  which also remains subject to petitions for reconsideration at the fcc and congressional review and modification  see business federal regulation of television broadcasting cross media ownership 
the fcc could implement legislation and or regulations that might have a significant impact on the operations of the stations we own and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcasting industry as a whole 
the fcc s ongoing rule making proceeding concerning implementation of the transition from analog to digital television broadcasts is likely to have a significant impact on the television industry and the operation of our stations and the stations we provide services to 
the fcc has initiated proceedings to determine whether to make tv joint sales agreements attributable interests under its ownership rules and to determine whether it should establish formal rules under which broadcasters will be required to serve the local public interest 
in addition  the fcc may decide to initiate other new rule making proceedings  on its own or in response to requests from outside parties  any of which might have such an impact 
congress also may act to amend the communications act in a manner that could impact our stations and the stations we provide services to or the television broadcast industry in general

as a result of our controlling financial interest in mission under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and in order to present fairly our financial position  results of operations and cash flows  we consolidate the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of mission as if it were a wholly owned entity 
we believe this presentation is meaningful for understanding our financial performance

as revised in december fin no 
r and have determined that we are required to continue consolidating mission s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
therefore  the following discussion of our financial position and results of operations includes mission s financial position and results of operations 
executive summary overview of operations we owned and operated television stations as of december  through various local service agreements  we programmed or provided sales and other services to additional television stations  including television stations owned and operated by mission as of december  mission is owned by an independent third party 
the following table summarizes the various local service agreements we had in effect as of december  with mission service agreements mission stations tba wfxp and khmt ssa jsa kjtl  kjbo lp  kolr  kcit  kcpn lp  kamc  krbc  ksan  wutr  wfxw formerly wbak  wyou  kode and wtvo we have a time brokerage agreement tba with each of these stations which allows us to program most of each station s broadcast time  sell each station s advertising time and retain the advertising revenue generated in exchange for monthly payments to mission 
we have both a shared services agreement ssa and a joint sales agreement jsa with each of these stations 
the ssa allows the sharing of services including news production  technical maintenance and security  in exchange for our right to receive certain payments from mission as described in the ssas 
the jsas permit us to sell and retain a percentage of the net revenue from the station s advertising time in return for monthly payments to mission of the remaining percentage of net revenue  as described in the jsas 
our ability to receive cash from mission is governed by these agreements 
the arrangements under the ssas and jsas have had the effect of us receiving substantially all of the available cash  after debt service costs  generated by the stations listed above 
the arrangements under the tbas have also had the effect of us receiving substantially all of the available cash generated by the tba stations listed above 
we anticipate that we will 
table of contents continue to receive substantially all of the available cash  after payments for debt service costs  generated by the stations listed above 
we also guarantee the obligations incurred under mission s senior secured credit facility 
similarly  mission is a guarantor of our senior secured credit facility and the senior subordinated notes we have issued 
in consideration of our guarantee of mission s senior credit facility  the sole shareholder of mission has granted us a purchase option to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent  for consideration equal to the greater of seven times the station s broadcast cash flow  as defined in the option agreement  less the amount of its indebtedness as defined in the option agreement  or the amount of its indebtedness 
these option agreements are freely exercisable or assignable by us without consent or approval by the sole shareholder of mission 
we do not own mission or mission s television stations 
however  as a result of our guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility and our arrangements under the local service agreements and purchase option agreements with mission  we are deemed under us gaap to have a controlling financial interest in mission while complying with the fcc s rules regarding ownership limits in television markets 
in order for both us and mission to comply with fcc regulations  mission maintains complete responsibility for and control over programming  finances  personnel and operations of its stations 
the operating revenue of our stations is derived primarily from broadcast advertising revenue  which is affected by a number of factors  including the economic conditions of the markets in which we operate  the demographic makeup of those markets and the marketing strategy we employ in each market 
most advertising contracts are short term and generally run for a few weeks 
excluding political revenue  and of our and mission s consolidated spot revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  was generated from local advertising 
the remaining advertising revenue represents inventory sold for national or political advertising 
each station has an agreement with a national representative firm that provides for representation outside the particular station s market 
national commission rates vary within the industry and are governed by each station s agreement 
all national and political revenue is derived from advertisements placed by advertising agencies 
the agencies receive a commission rate of of the gross amount of advertising schedules placed by them 
while the majority of local spot revenue is placed by local agencies  some advertisers place their schedules directly with the stations local sales staff  thereby eliminating the agency commission 
advertising revenue is positively affected by strong local economies  national and regional political election campaigns  and certain events such as the olympic games or the super bowl 
because television broadcast stations rely on advertising revenue  declines in advertising budgets  particularly in recessionary periods  adversely affect the broadcast industry  and as a result may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations 
the stations advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to  and including  the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during even numbered years resulting from political advertising and advertising aired during the olympic games 
each of our stations and the stations we provide services to  except for kcpn lp  has a network affiliation agreement pursuant to which the network provides programming to the station during specified time periods  including prime time 
under the affiliation agreements with nbc  cbs and abc  most of our stations and the stations we provide services to receive cash compensation for distributing the network s programming over the air and for allowing the network to keep a portion of advertising inventory during those time periods 
the affiliation agreements with fox and upn do not provide for compensation 
each station acquires licenses to broadcast programming in non news and non network time periods 
the licenses are either purchased from a program distributor for cash and or the program distributor is allowed to sell some of the advertising inventory as compensation to eliminate or reduce the cash cost for the license 
the latter practice is referred to as barter broadcast rights 
the station records the estimated fair market value of the licenses  including any advertising inventory given to the program distributor  as a broadcast right asset and liability 
barter broadcast rights are recorded at management s estimate of the value of the advertising time 
table of contents exchanged using historical advertising rates  which approximates the fair value of the program material received 
the assets are amortized as a component of amortization of broadcast rights 
amortization is computed using the straight line method based on the license period or usage  whichever yields the greater expense 
the cash broadcast rights liabilities are reduced by monthly payments while the barter liability is amortized over the life of the contract as barter revenue 
our primary operating expenses consist of commissions on advertising revenue  employee compensation and related benefits  newsgathering and programming costs 
a large percentage of the costs involved in the operation of our stations and the stations we provide services to remain relatively fixed 
industry trends net broadcast revenue on a same station basis decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net broadcast revenue in was higher than in due to a few factors 
the demand for advertising was favorably affected by the improving us economy and by the volume of advertising time purchased by campaigns for elective offices and for political issues 
the demand for political advertising is generally higher in even numbered years  when congressional and presidential elections occur  than in odd numbered years 
during an election year  political revenue makes up a significant portion of the increase in revenue in that year 
since was an election year  a large percentage of the company s revenue growth in was attributable to political revenue 
however  even during an election year  political revenue is influenced by geography and the competitiveness of the election races 
political revenue was million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the television bureau of advertising reported that us television advertising revenue increased in largely due to political advertising and the olympic games 
the television bureau of advertising forecasted advertising revenue to be flat in primarily due to less political spending in and the absence of olympic spending 
automotive related advertising represented approximately and of our total net revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our automotive related advertising decreased approximately for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in due to a decline in demand for advertising from the automotive business sector 
a significant change in this advertising revenue source could materially affect our future results of operations

the minority interest in consolidated entity of million for the year ended december  related to the recognition of million of expenses due to the application of fin no 
as it pertains to stations kfta knwa prior to the consummation of its acquisition and to the local service agreements mission had with wfxw from may  to april  liquidity and capital resources we and mission are highly leveraged  which makes the company vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions 
our and mission s ability to meet the future cash requirements described below depends on our and mission s ability to generate cash in the future  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other conditions  many of which are beyond our and mission s control 
based on current operations and anticipated future growth  we believe that our and mission s available cash  anticipated cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the nexstar and mission senior credit facilities will be sufficient to fund working capital  capital expenditure requirements  interest payments and scheduled debt principal payments for at least the next twelve months 
in order to meet future cash needs we may  from time to time  borrow under credit facilities or issue other long or short term debt or equity  if the market and the terms of our existing debt arrangements permit  and mission may  from time to time  borrow under its available credit facility 
we will continue to evaluate the best use of nexstar s operating cash flow among its capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt reduction

adjustment was derecognized on april  based on covenant calculations  as of december   there was approximately million of total available borrowings that could be drawn under the nexstar and mission senior secured credit facilities 
on april   we and mission refinanced borrowings outstanding under various long term debt obligations 
in connection with the refinancing  we redeemed million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding notes  increased the borrowings under the term loan to our senior secured credit facility by million and issued million in the aggregate principal amount of notes 
under our new senior secured credit facility agreement  the applicable margin component of the revolving loan was decreased by basis points  representing one percent 
our new credit facility agreement also extended the maturity dates of the term and revolving loan to a combination of proceeds obtained from borrowings under our senior credit facility and the issuance of the notes were used to fund the redemption of the notes 
additionally  on april   mission increased the borrowings under the term loan to its senior secured credit facility by million  reduced the applicable margin component of its revolving loan and extended the maturity dates of its term and revolving loan 
terms of mission s new senior secured credit facility are the same as nexstar s new credit facility 
cash flows operating activities the comparative net cash flows from operating activities decreased by million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily due to a further decline in operating results as reflected in the million increase in net loss and a decrease of million in cash flows from interest payable  partially offset by an increase of million in cash flows from accounts receivable and an increase of million in cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses 
also contributing to the decline was the increase in cash payments associated with debt extinguishments  which were million for the year ended december   compared to the million for the same period in cash paid for interest increased by million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in cash payments of interest for the year ended december  included million for our notes and million for our notes  along with the original million discount related to the notes 
cash payments for interest for the year ended december  included million for our 
table of contents notes and million for our notes 
cash payments of interest on our and mission s senior credit facilities increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to higher interest rates and a greater amount of debt outstanding in on the respective credit facilities 
nexstar and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
mission files its own separate federal income tax return 
additionally  nexstar and mission file their own state and local tax returns as are required 
due to our and mission s recent history of net operating losses  we and mission currently do not pay any federal income taxes 
these net operating losses may be carried forward  subject to expiration and certain limitations  and used to reduce taxable earnings in future years 
through the use of available loss carryforwards  it is possible that we and mission may not pay significant amounts of federal income taxes in the foreseeable future 
cash flows investing activities the comparative net cash used for investing activities increased by million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash used for capital additions and station acquisitions 
the increase was due to increases in purchases of property and equipment and acquisition related payments 
capital expenditures were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to digital conversion expenditures  which increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period in we project that full year capital expenditures will be approximately million 
cash used for station acquisitions was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  acquisition related payments for the year ended december  included the remaining payments of million and million  exclusive of transaction costs  for mission s acquisition of wtvo and our acquisition of kfta knwa  respectively

the decrease was partially offset by an increase in payments of debt financing costs of million made in connection with the april  refinancing of our and mission s long term debt obligations and the october amendment of our senior secured credit facility agreement as compared to the payments made in connection with the august amending of our and mission s senior secured credit facilities 
the april  refinancing of our and mission s long term debt obligations provided the company net cash proceeds of million  before the payment of transaction fees and expenses  consisting of gross proceeds obtained under senior credit facility term loans and our issuance of notes of million and the repayments of previous senior credit facility term and revolving borrowings and our notes of million 
the august amending of our and mission s senior secured credit facilities provided the company 
table of contents net cash proceeds of million  before the payment of transaction fees and expenses  consisting of gross proceeds obtained under senior credit facility term loans of million and the repayments of previous senior credit facility term and revolving borrowings of million 
the net amount of cash received from financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of net borrowings of million under senior credit facility revolving loans  the repayments of our senior discount notes of million and senior credit facility term loan repayments of million 
during the year ended december   there were million of other repayments under our and mission s senior secured credit facilities  consisting of scheduled term loan maturities of million and a voluntary repayment of million 
although the nexstar and mission senior credit facilities now allow for the payment of cash dividends to common stockholders  we and mission do not currently intend to declare or pay a cash dividend 
future sources of financing and debt service requirements as of december   nexstar and mission had total combined debt of million  which represented of nexstar and mission s combined capitalization 
our and mission s high level of debt requires that a substantial portion of cash flow be dedicated to pay principal and interest on debt which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes

interest payments on our and mission s senior credit facilities are generally paid every one to three months and are payable based on the type of interest rate selected 
the terms of the nexstar and mission senior credit facilities  as well as the indentures governing our publicly held notes  limit  but do not prohibit us or mission from incurring substantial amounts of additional debt in the future 
we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 
however  a downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to renew existing  or obtain access to  new credit facilities or otherwise issue debt in the future and could increase the cost of such facilities 

table of contents debt covenants our bank credit facility agreement contains covenants which require us to comply with certain financial ratios  including a maximum total and senior leverage ratios  b a minimum interest coverage ratio  and c a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
the covenants  which are formally calculated on a quarterly basis  are based on the combined results of nexstar broadcasting and mission 
the senior subordinated notes and senior discount notes contain restrictive covenants customary for borrowing arrangements of this type 
mission s bank credit facility agreement does not contain financial covenant ratio requirements  but does provide for default in the event nexstar does not adequately comply with all covenants contained in its credit agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing the publicly held notes 
we anticipate compliance with all the covenants through december  in october  we amended our credit facility agreement to adjust the total and senior leverage ratios for periods after september  the amended financial covenant ratios are less restrictive than the previously effective ratios 
for a discussion of the financial ratio requirements of these covenants  we refer you to note of our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k 
use of derivative financial instruments interest rate swap and collar agreements in the past  we had used interest rate swap and collar agreements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt or to hedge fair value changes in the bench mark interest rate on our fixed rate senior notes 
as of december   all of our interest rate swap and collar agreements had either been terminated or expired  and we currently hold no derivative financial instruments 
until december   we had in effect an interest rate swap agreement to pay a fixed interest rate and receive a variable interest rate as required by our bank credit facility agreement  with a notional amount of million 
this interest rate swap agreement expired on december  as the successor to quorum  we had entered into an interest rate collar agreement for a notional amount of million through september  and million from september  through december  under the agreement the ceiling and floor interest rates were and  respectively 
this agreement was terminated on april  with no gain or loss being recognized 
cash requirements for digital television dtv conversion it will be expensive to convert our and mission s stations from the current analog format to the digital broadcast format 
this conversion required an average initial capital expenditure of approximately million per station for low power transmission of digital signal programming 
except for knwa  all of the television stations we and mission own and operate are broadcasting at least a low power digital television signal 
digital conversion expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we estimate that it will require an average capital expenditure of approximately million per station for stations to modify our and mission s stations dtv transmitters for full power digital signal transmission  including costs for the transmitter  transmission line  antenna and installation  and estimated costs for tower upgrades and or modifications 
we anticipate these expenditures will be funded through available cash on hand and cash generated from operations as incurred in future years 
stations that fail to meet the fcc s build out deadlines  and that have not requested an extension of time from the fcc  will lose interference protection for their signals outside their low power coverage areas 
as of december   mission s stations wutr  wtvo and wyou are transmitting full power digital signals and nexstar s station wbre is transmitting a full power digital signal 
we and mission filed requests for extension of time to construct full power dtv facilities 
table of contents for our top four network affiliates in the top one hundred market stations 
the fcc has not yet acted on these requests for extension of time 
the fcc also adopted additional program system and information protocol psip requirements 
the equipment and related installation necessary to meet the psip requirements cost approximately million in total for our stations and the stations to which we provide services 
these expenditures were funded in through available cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
no off balance sheet arrangements at december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
all of our arrangements with mission are on balance sheet arrangements 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  broadcast rights  trade and barter  income taxes  commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
for an overview of our significant accounting policies  we refer you to note of our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item a of this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical 
table of contents accounting policies are those that are the most important to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions  and require the most subjective or complex judgments by management 
consolidation of mission and variable interest entities our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of independently owned mission and certain other entities where it has been determined that the company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation on accounting research bulletin no 
fin no 
as revised in december fin no 
r 
under us gaap  a company must consolidate an entity when it has a controlling financial interest resulting from ownership of a majority of the entity s voting rights 
fin no 
r expands the definition of controlling financial interest to include factors other than equity ownership and voting rights 
in applying fin no 
r  we must base our decision to consolidate an entity on quantitative and qualitative factors that indicate whether or not we are absorbing a majority of the entity s economic risks or receiving a majority of the entity s economic rewards 
our evaluation of the risks and rewards model must be an ongoing process and may alter as facts and circumstances change 
mission is included in our consolidated financial statements because we believe we have a controlling financial interest in mission as a result of local service agreements we have with each of mission s stations  our guarantee of the obligations incurred under mission s senior credit facility and purchase options granted by mission s sole shareholder which will permit us to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each mission station  subject to fcc consent 
in addition  generally in connection with acquisitions  the company enters into time brokerage agreements tba and begins operating a station before receiving fcc consent to the transfer of the station s ownership and broadcast license 
we include a station operated under a tba in our consolidated financial statements because we believe that we have a controlling financial interest in the station as a result of the company assuming the credit risk of advertising revenue it sold on the station and the company paying for substantially all the station s reasonable operating expenses  as required under the agreement 
additionally  in connection with acquisitions  upon entering into the tba it is considered probable that the fcc will consent to the sale of the station and transfer of the station s broadcast license within a reasonable period of time 
valuation of intangible assets the process of establishing the value of intangible assets and performing our annual impairment testing of goodwill and broadcast licenses fcc licenses  requires us to make a significant number of assumptions and estimates in determining a fair value based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted cash flows analysis 
to assist in this process  we utilize the services of independent appraisal and valuation consulting firms 
the assumptions and estimates required for the discounted cash flows analysis included market revenue share  future market revenue growth  operating profit margins  cash flow multiples  weighted average cost of capital  our ability to renew affiliation contracts  among others 
the value of fcc licenses is determined assuming a hypothetical independent start up station whose only intangible asset is the fcc license 
the value of network affiliation agreements is determined as the difference between the value derived for the hypothetical independent start up station and the value derived assuming that the start up station has a network affiliation 
we test the impairment of goodwill and fcc licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment tests consist of a comparison of the assets fair value  based on a discounted cash flows analysis  to their carrying amount on a market by market basis 
the projected future cash flows used to test fcc licenses excludes network compensation payments 
our 
table of contents estimate of future cash flows may be significantly impacted due to an adverse change in the advertising marketplace or other economic factors affecting our industry at the time the impairment tests are performed 
nexstar and mission completed the annual test of impairment for goodwill and fcc licenses as of december   and  which resulted in no impairment being recognized in  and we test network affiliation agreements for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections and anticipated future cash flows 
the process we use for determining the recoverability of network affiliation agreements is subjective and requires us to make estimates and judgments about the cash flows attributable to the network affiliation agreements over their estimated remaining useful lives 
an impairment in the carrying amount of a network affiliation agreement is recognized when the expected future operating cash flow derived from the asset is less than its carrying value 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts were million and million at december  and  respectively 
broadcast rights assets carrying amount broadcast rights assets are stated at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
cash broadcast rights are initially recorded at the amount paid or payable to program distributors for the limited right to broadcast the distributors programming 
barter broadcast rights are recorded at our estimate of the value of the advertising time exchanged  which approximates the fair value of the programming received 
the value of the advertising time exchanged is estimated by applying average historical rates for specific time periods 
amortization of broadcast rights assets is computed using the straight line method based on the license period or programming usage  whichever yields the greater expense 
the current portion of broadcast rights assets represents those rights available for broadcast which will be amortized in the succeeding year 
when projected future net revenue associated with a program is less than the current carrying amount of the program broadcast rights due to  for example  poor ratings  we write down the unamortized cost of the broadcast rights asset to equal the amount of projected future net revenue 
if the expected broadcast period was shortened or cancelled due  for example  to poor ratings  we would be required to write off the remaining value of the related broadcast rights to operations on an accelerated basis or possibly immediately 
as of december   the amounts of current broadcast rights and non current broadcast rights were million and million  respectively 
trade and barter transactions we trade certain advertising time for various goods and services 
these transactions are recorded at the estimated fair value of the goods or services received 
we barter advertising time for certain program material 
these transactions  except those involving exchange of advertising time for network programming  are recorded at management s estimate of the value of the advertising time exchanged  which approximates the fair value of the program material received 
the value of advertising time exchanged is estimated by applying average historical advertising rates for specific time periods 
we recorded barter revenue of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
trade revenue of million  million and million was recorded for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we incurred trade and barter expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is likely to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such a determination was made 
derivatives all of nexstar s interest rate swap and collar agreements were terminated or expired through as of december  and  we held no derivative financial instruments 
we may use derivative financial instruments for purposes other than trading  such as for hedging long term variable rate debt to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  as dictated by our credit agreement and for hedging fair value changes attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate on fixed rate debt 
all derivatives are recognized on our balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction  based on criteria established by fasb statement of financial accounting standards no

we assess  both at its inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items 
we assess hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings 
if we determine that a cash flow hedge is no longer probable of occurring  we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the forecasted transaction  and any unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings 
the change in market values of derivative instruments and the marking to market of those interest rate swap agreements resulted in recognition of million and million in other income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change in market values was due to a fluctuation in market interest rates 
the termination of the swap agreement on december  resulted in the recognition of million in other income for the year ended december  claims and loss contingencies in the normal course of business  we are party to various claims and legal proceedings 
we record a liability for these matters when an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimated 
we consider a combination of factors when estimating probable losses  including judgments about potential actions by counter parties 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r which replaces sfas no 
and supercedes apb no 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
as originally issued 
however  sfas no 
r eliminates the use of the alternative apb no 
intrinsic value method of accounting that was provided in sfas no 
and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based employee compensation in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
the pro forma footnote disclosure previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
under sfas no 
r  compensation cost related to stock options is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award using an option pricing model and will be recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period 
sfas no 
r is effective as of the beginning of the first interim reporting period that begins after june   however  on april   the securities and exchange commission issued a ruling that changed the effective date for public companies to fiscal years that begin after june  which for the company is january  
table of contents nexstar has elected to adopt this new standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
using the modified prospective transition method  beginning january  nexstar will recognize compensation expense for all newly granted or modified stock options based on the requirements of sfas no 
r and will begin recognizing compensation expense over the remaining vesting period for the unvested portion of all stock options granted prior to adoption based on the fair values previously calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes 
the black scholes option pricing model has been used to value nexstar s employee stock options for disclosure purposes and this option pricing model will be used under sfas no 
r 
as permitted by sfas no 
 nexstar currently accounts for stock based compensation to employees using the intrinsic value method of apb no 
and  as such  has not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s expense recognition provision will have a significant impact on the nexstar s results of operations 
at december   the aggregate value of the unvested portion of previously issued stock options was approximately million 
compensation cost related to these stock options will be recognized as expense ratably over the remaining vesting period of the awards which become fully vested in the actual impact of adopting sfas no 
r will depend on  among other factors  the market price of nexstar s common stock  the terms  number and timing of future stock option award grants 
however  based on the awards currently known to be outstanding  nexstar anticipates that the impact of adopting sfas r will result in annual expense in of approximately million per basic and diluted share 
this estimate does not include the impact of additional awards  which may be granted  or forfeitures  which may occur  but are not presently known 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 

the amendments made by sfas no 
require that exchanges of nonmonetary assets be accounted for at fair value of the assets exchanged  unless the exchange lacks commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance when the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
this new standard eliminates a provision in apb opinion no 
that exempted nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets from fair value accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  therefore  sfas no 
was effective for the company on july  the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in march  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

fin no 
clarifies that an entity must record a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
a conditional asset retirement obligation is a term used in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  that refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin no 
is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december   which is the company s current fiscal year ending december  the adoption of fin no 
did not have any material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
requires entities that voluntarily make a change in accounting principle to apply that change retrospectively to all prior period financial statements as if the principle had always been used  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
previously under apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  most voluntary changes in accounting principle were recognized by including in net income of the period of change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
in addition to voluntary changes  this new standard establishes retrospective application as the required method for adopting a newly issued accounting pronouncement when the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
also requires that a change in method of depreciation  
table of contents amortization  or depletion for long lived  nonfinancial assets  be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle  the effects of which are to be applied prospectively in the period of change and future periods 
this statement also makes a distinction between retrospective application of an accounting principle and the restatement of financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
sfas no 
applies to accounting changes and error corrections that are made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
 as applicable  beginning in fiscal in june  the fasb eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds eitf no 

eitf provides guidance on fas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information and how to determine whether operating segments which do not meet certain quantitative thresholds may be aggregated and reported as a single operating segment 
eitf is effective for fiscal years ending after september   and corresponding information for earlier periods  including interim periods  should be restated unless it is impractical to do so 
the company has adopted the guidance as of the year ending december  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for hybrid financial instruments an amendment to of fasb statements no 
and sfas no 

sfas no 
provides a fair value measurement option for certain hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation 
under sfas no 
 an entity must irrevocably elect  on an instrument by instrument basis  to apply fair value accounting to a hybrid financial instrument in its entirety in lieu of separately accounting for the instrument as a host contract and derivative instrument 
additionally  sfas no 
clarifies that both interest only and principal only strips are not subject to the provision of sfas no 
and establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are freestanding versus those that are embedded derivatives 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september   which for the company is january  earlier adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
beginning in fiscal management is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this statement will have on the company s consolidated financial statements  which will primarily depend on the types of hybrid financial instruments the company issues or acquires in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
all borrowings at december  under the senior credit facilities bear interest at  which represented the base rate  or libor  plus the applicable margin  as defined 
interest is payable in accordance with the credit agreements 

table of contents the following table estimates the changes to cash flow from operations as of december  if interest rates were to fluctuate by or basis points  or bps where basis points represents one percentage point  for a twelve month period interest rate decrease no change to interest rate interest rate increase bps bps bps bps in thousands senior credit facilities senior subordinated notes due senior discount notes due total there is no change to our cash flow from operations associated with our senior subordinated and senior discount notes because these are fixed rate debt obligations 
as of december   we have no financial instruments in place to hedge against changes in the benchmark interest rates on this fixed rate debt 
the fair value of long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt at december  was approximately million  which was approximately million less than its carrying value 
fair values are determined from quoted market prices where available or based on estimates made by investment banking firms 
in the past  nexstar has used derivative instruments to manage our exposures to interest rate risks 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments 
our objective for holding derivatives is to minimize these risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures 
we used interest rate swap arrangements  not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
 in connection with our variable rate senior credit facilities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
given the interest rates that were in effect at december   as of that date  we estimated that our cash flows from operations would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively  for a bps and bps interest rate decrease  and decreased by approximately million and million  respectively  for a bps and bps interest rate increase 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt at december  excluding sfas no 
hedge accounting adjustment was approximately million  which was approximately million greater than its carrying value 
impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not affected by moderate changes in the inflation rate
