item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following section provides a narrative discussion about manatron s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
the comments that follow should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company enters into contracts with customers to license or sell application software  third party software  hardware  related professional services  such as installation  training  data conversions and post contract support and maintenance pcs services  and various appraisal services 
the company recognizes revenue for contracts with multiple element software arrangements in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
the company allocates the total arrangement fee among each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each of the deliverables  determined based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
when discounts are offered in a software arrangement  the company utilizes the residual method  as defined in sop  and allocates revenue to the undelivered elements based on vsoe 
the discount and remaining revenue are allocated to the delivered elements  which typically encompass the software  service and hardware components of the contract 
certain of the company s software arrangements involve off the shelf software and services that are not considered essential to the functionality of the software 
for these arrangements  software revenue is recognized when the installation has occurred  customer acceptance is reasonably assured  the sales price represents an enforceable claim and is probable of collection  and the remaining services such as training and installation are considered nominal 
fees allocable to services under these arrangements are recognized as revenue as the services are performed 
revenue related to sales of computer hardware and supplies is recognized when title passes  which is normally the shipping or installation date 
pcs includes telephone support  bug fixes  enhancements and rights to upgrades on a when and if available basis 
these support fees are typically billed in advance on a monthly  quarterly or annual basis and are recognized as revenue ratably over the related contract periods 
billings for future services  as reflected in the accompanying balance sheets  includes pcs and other services that have been billed to the customer in advance of performance 
it also includes customer deposits on new contracts and other progress billings for software and hardware that have not been completely installed 
for arrangements that include customization or modification of the software  or where software services are otherwise considered essential  or for software that is not generally available  revenue is recognized using contract accounting 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized using the percentage of completion method with progress to completion measured based primarily upon labor hours incurred 
revenue earned is based on the progress to completion percentage after giving effect to the most recent estimates of total cost 
changes to total estimated contract costs  if any  are recognized in the period they are determined 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
as of april  and  the reserves for contract losses  as well as billed retainages outstanding associated with revenue that has been recognized  were  and  respectively 
for its real estate appraisal projects  the company recognizes revenue using the proportional performance method as the company believes that each of its projects result in one ultimate deliverable  the appraised values of all properties defined within a given contract  and due to the fact that many of these projects are implemented over a one to three year period and consist of various activities 
under this method of revenue recognition  the company identifies each activity for the appraisal project with a typical project generally calling for planning  data collection  data verification  data input  project management  abstracts and hearings 
the costs for these activities are determined and the total contract value is then allocated to each activity based on the proportion of the budgeted cost for a given activity divided by the total budgeted cost for a project 
revenue recognition occurs for each activity based upon the proportional performance method  driven prima rily by output measures such as parcels or hearings complete 
actual costs are expensed in the period in which they occur 
since the timing of billings does not always coincide with revenue recognition  the company reflects revenues earned in excess of billings and retainages  as well as billings in excess of revenues for contracts in process at the end of the reporting period  as reflected in the accompanying balance sheets 
reserves against accounts receivable and reserves against revenues earned in excess of billings and retainages are established based on the company s collection history and other known risks associated with the related contracts 
these reserves contain a general provision of  as well as a specific provision for accounts the company believes will be difficult to collect 
because of the nature of its customers  which are predominantly governmental entities  the company does not generally incur losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
alternatively  customers may become dissatisfied with the functionality of the software products and or the quality of the services provided and request a reduction to the aggregate contract price 
management reviews significant past due accounts receivables on a quarterly basis and the related adequacy of the company s reserves 
as of april  and  the company s reserves for uncollectible a ccounts receivable and revenues earned in excess of billings and retainages were  and  respectively 
the company s contracts do not typically contain a right of return or cancellation 
for those that do  management reviews the adequacy of the company s reserves for returns or cancellations on a quarterly basis 
as of april  and  these reserves for returns were not material 
notes receivable result from certain software contracts in which customers pay for the application software  hardware or related services over an extended period of time  generally three to five years 
interest on these notes ranges from to 
the company recognizes revenue for these contracts when the related elements are delivered  as the contract terms are fixed and determinable  and the company has a longstanding history of collecting on the notes under the original payment terms without providing concessions 
in addition  certain of the company s contracts with customers include lease terms which meet the criteria of sales type leases as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
however  the company s leasing activities are not a material part of its business activities and  accordingly  are not separately presented in the accompanying financial statements 
the company has approximately million of goodwill recorded as of april  related to prior acquisitions 
as more fully described in note of the notes to financial statements  a new accounting standard adopted in fiscal requires that goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and as indicators of impairment occur 
the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment requires the use of estimates about the future cash flows of each reporting unit to determine estimated fair values 
changes in forecasted operations and changes in discount rates can materially affect these estimates 
the annual tests performed by the company indicated that no impairment of goodwill has occurred 
as more fully described in note of the notes to financials statements  the company capitalizes software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility on a specific software project 
this intangible asset is amortized over an estimated useful life of not greater than three years 
the unamortized balance of capitalized software is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable by calculating the net realizable value for each respective product 
the net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from a product reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
changes in forecasted operations  driven primarily by market trends and customer demand  can materially affect the estimates of net realizable value 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year the company s business is primarily focused on providing software and services to enable local governments in north america to completely  fairly and efficiently assess real and personal property  and to bill and collect the related property taxes from its citizens 
the company s software manages the entire property life cycle  which includes deed recording  mapping gis  assessment  tax billing and collection  tax sales and e government 
the company s revenues are generated from software licenses  hardware sales  forms and supplies sales  and various related professional services  such as software support  data conversions  installation  training  project management  hardware maintenance  forms processing and printing 
the company s revenues are also generated from appraisal services  which include mass real estate appraisals  revaluations and other appraisal related consultative work 
for simplicity purposes  many of the numbers described below are rounded  however  the fluctuations and percentage variations are based upon the actual amounts 
total net revenues of million for the three months ended april  decreased by million or in comparison to the million of net revenues that were reported for the three months ended april  on the positive side  net revenues for the fourth quarter were higher than the net revenues the company reported for the third quarter 
much of this was due to the acquisition of asix  which was completed on february  for the fourth quarter  asix contributed million in net revenues  which was down somewhat from their normal run rate due to the timing of their service contracts 
for its most recent year ended december   asix generated million in revenues and produced million in operating income 
total net revenues of million for the year ended april  decreased million or from million for the year ended april  the decreases in revenues for the three months and year ended april  were primarily due to reductions in software license fees and appraisal services revenues 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in professional services revenues  and recurring support and maintenance revenues 
software license revenues decreased by million or to  for the three months ended april  and by million or to million for the year ended april  versus the prior year comparable periods 
the prior year included significant license fees related to arizona department of revenue  charlotte county  florida  duval county  florida  gwinnett county  georgia  belmont county  ohio  mahoning county  ohio  wood county  ohio  davidson county  tennessee  and the city of virginia beach  virginia 
current year software license revenues have been negatively impacted by lower than expected sales 
as was the case in prior years  the company had planned for million of its fiscal software license and professional services revenues to come from contracts that were signed in that fiscal year in order to meet its financial plan 
while the company did have million of unearned license fees in its backlog as of the beginning of fiscal  the company was not able to recognize all of them in fiscal due to the timing of several client implementations and the related product rollout plans 
as a result  a significant portion of these amounts remain in the company s backlog for fiscal although there have been no significant software license revenues recognized in fiscal like the company had for fiscal  the company did recognize software license revenues from a number of other important tax and cama implementations 
for example  fiscal includes software license revenues from projects in columbia county  florida  gwinnett county  geor gia  bonneville county  idaho  perry county  indiana  marshall county  indiana  posey county  indiana  columbiana county  ohio  defiance county  ohio  licking county  ohio and the city of virginia beach  virginia 
software license revenues and related professional services revenues are primarily driven by the company s backlog  new sales and the timing of the related software installations and implementations  and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year 
many of the larger and more complex jurisdictions  which the company is now able to pursue due to its new product and business strategy  often take more than a year to fully implement 
in addition  a number of these contracts are often accounted for using the percentage of completion method  which results in the software license revenues being recognized over the implementation period 
appraisal services revenues decreased by from million to million for the three months ended april  and by from million to million for the year ended april   versus the prior year comparable periods 
these decreases were anticipated as the company has been at the low point of its appraisal services cycle  which was reflected in its backlog amounts 
the company s backlog for appraisal services decreased to million as it entered fiscal from million at the beginning of fiscal on the positive side  the company did sign contracts for million of appraisal services work during fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the company s backlog for appraisal services at april  was million 
it should also be noted that the company will continue to make the necessary changes to ensure that its costs of appraisal services are in line with the anticipated revenues 
professional services revenues recognized in the fourth quarter decreased from million to million 
for the entire fiscal year  professional services revenues increased by from to million 
while professional services revenues can also vary like software license fees from quarter to quarter  they generally are higher following the installation of the software 
the increase for the year is primarily due to change orders for additional services provided to the city of baltimore in the first quarter of the current fiscal year and the additional revenues contributed by asix in the fourth quarter 
recurring software support and maintenance revenue has increased by  or to million for the three months ended april  and by million or to million for the year ended april  versus the prior year comparable periods 
these increases are a result of software implementations for new clients  price increases and the acquisitions of visicraft  plexis and asix 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
the company anticipates that this revenue stream will continue to grow as it increases prices and completes the software implementations for its additional new clients in alaska  arizona  idaho  maryland  minnesota  nevada  south carolina  tennessee and virginia 
in addition  the company recently notified many of its clients that their prices for subsequent years were going to be substantially higher than average to bring them more in line with the market 
finally  the acquisitions of plexis and asix will continue to positively impact recurring support revenue for at least an additional six and nine months  respectively  as their results of operations were not included with the company s results until november  and february   the closing dates of each of the acquisitions  respectively 
despite the upward movement in professional services revenues  and recurring software support and maintenance revenues  total net revenues were well below the company s expectations 
two factors that significantly affect the company s net revenues are backlog and current sales 
total signed contracts or sales for fiscal were million lower than the fiscal amount which negatively impacted the company s backlog  as it entered fiscal as a result and as noted in previous reports  the company had planned for approximately million of its fiscal revenues to come from contracts that were signed in that fiscal year in order to meet its financial plan 
while the company did sign several significant new contracts in fiscal as noted below  the nature  number and dollar amount of the contracts were not sufficient enough for the company to meet its financial plan 
total signed contracts or sales for the year ended april  were million compared to million for the year ended april  while the company s sales results for fiscal were below the company s expectations  the company did sign on a number of key accounts during the current year 
specifically  the company signed a million contract with the minnesota counties computer cooperative mccc for the company s grm tax product 
mccc is a joint powers organization providing services  software  and other cost effective measures to substantially reduce the cost of data processing for minnesota counties 
currently of minnesota s counties are members of the mccc tax user group  and they work cooperatively under a single contract for property tax software and services 
this is one of the most significant tax contracts in the history of the company and currently only covers of the counties in the consortium 
additional c ounties are expected to sign up once the project is further along 
in fact  blue earth county  which is not currently part of the consortium  also signed a tax contract for  in fiscal in addition  there will be opportunities for the company to sell complimentary products such as manatron cama and manatron recorder to mccc that will integrate with the manatron grm tax application 
also included in the fiscal sales amount is a  contract for the company s first cama contract in tennessee  with williamson county 
the company also recently received its first major cama contract in the state of south carolina from horry county myrtle beach for  the company also won a million appraisal services contract from franklin county  ohio 
finally  the company won its first property tax contract in nevada from washoe county reno for million 
as of april   the company s backlog for software and related services was million compared to million at april  the company s backlog for appraisal services decreased to million at april  versus million at april  these backlog amounts are exclusive of the company s million of annualized recurring revenue from hardware maintenance  software support  e government subscriptions  and printing and processing contracts as of april  the company is still confident in its strategy and believes it is not a matter of if  but rather when  local governments will purchase new property tax and cama software 
while the company s sales cycles have been complex and quite long  approaching two to three years in some cases  and the market has been softer than anticipated  input  a market research firm  recently predicted that state and local governments would increase their spending on it outsourcing from billion in to billion by this  coupled with a growing pipeline of new prospects and the recent grm contract wins  reinforces the company s ongoing confidence in the overall market 
fiscal was also highlighted by the successful launch of the company s first full grm installation in gwinnett county  georgia 
there has been a lot of discussion about the significance of this launch  as well as the importance of gwinnett county in the company s prior form q filings 
gwinnett county is paying support fees and has been a positive reference site for prospective new grm customers  including mccc and washoe county 
in addition  the company took its second and third full grm implementations live in payette county  idaho and kenai  alaska subsequent to year end 
this is the same application that is operating live in gwinnett county  georgia and is in process of being implemented in arizona  idaho  minnesota  nevada  south carolina  tennessee and virginia 
the grm suite of software is a feature rich  fully integrated enterprise level solution that enables gwinnett  payette and kenai counties  as well as other customers to not only replace their legacy systems  but to realize significant efficiencies and cost savings  provide more and modern services to their constituents and  in many cases  to collect additional tax revenues  which will more than offset the cost of the grm system to the customer 
the completion of this new  next generation national product was a key pillar in the company s growth strategy 
it provides a competitive edge in the market as few  if any  other companies currently have a similar product suite 
historically  the company had unique tax products for each state in which it operated 
this required separate sales  marketing  development  and support initiatives 
the company expects to realize significant cost savings and economies of scale as it continues to market and implement grm  across the marketplace 
the company s current focus is on successfully completing the other grm implementations so that the sales team will have additional references upon which to build 
in addition  the company has made significant progress on its tax and assessment products within the ohio market 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  defiance county  ohio went live on the company s integrated solution for ohio 
this was a major milestone for the company in that it was the first implementation the company has completed in less than days 
the company plans to build off of this success during fiscal as a number of additional ohio clients are upgrading their legacy systems to this software 
the company also completed two acquisitions during fiscal effective november   the company completed the acquisition of plexis group see note of the notes to financial statements 
plexis was generating over million in annual revenues  of which  was from recurring software support agreements when the company acquired it 
this acquisition has provided key employees with subject matter expertise  who are helping cement our leadership position in the indiana market and improve the ongoing rollout of our grm solution nationwide 
effective february   the company completed the acquisition of asix inc see note of the notes to financial statements 
asix generated million in annual revenues  of which million was from recurring software support agreements for the year ended december  this acquisition has provided the company with immediate and better access to the california marketplace  which the company has conservatively estimated to be valued at million 
asix is currently a sub contractor to bearingpoint  inc to provide technical services and subject matter expertise in connection with a million project to develop a state of the art property tax and assessment system for the county of san diego 
in connection with the county of san diego project  bearingpoint and asix have entered into an exclusive joint marketing arrangement to provide the developed solution to other california counties 
the asix acquisition also augments the company s capacity and capabilities in minnesota  where the company has just begun its implementation of the mccc and blue earth property tax contracts as previously noted 
asix recently completed a successful implementation of their property tax system in anoka county  minnesota 
as a result  the company is currently leveraging asix s efforts and minnesota expertise in these engagements  which will facilitate the successful completion of these projects 
the company is also leveraging the knowledge and expertise asix has in nevada as a result of their successful property tax implementation in clark county las vegas  and the washoe county reno property tax implementation that is now underway 
finally  asix personnel have been working collectively with manatron in illinois  missouri and oregon to accelerate the successful penetration of these markets 
the company will continue to pursue other acquisitions that are aligned with its goals as part of its growth strategy 
despite the decreases in revenues  cost of revenues increased by  or from million to million for the three months ended april  for the year  cost of revenues increased by million or from million to million 
these increases were mostly driven by  of additional subcontractor expense over the prior year period primarily associated with the city of baltimore implementation 
the company incurred million of subcontractor expense during fiscal associated with phase one of the city of baltimore implementation 
for the year ended april   the company only recognized  of revenue associated with this implementation and incurred million of total cost resulting in a loss from operations of million on this implementation alone 
as noted in prior filings  the city of baltimore has delayed its go live date several times thus far and most recently made the decision to delay once more until january of this project has turned into a custom build solution versus the commercial off the shelf cots product initially purchased 
the company is currently in negotiations with unisys the prime contractor to address how the company will be compensated for out of scope work performed since march  the majority of the work now required by the city of baltimore is beyond the scope of the contract 
the subcontractor agreement with unisys prohibits the company from having direct interaction with the city of baltimore 
thus  the company has minimal ability to influence the timing of the go live date 
the company has however  obtained verbal approval from unisys to continue working on this project and  as such  will be paid for all out of scope work 
since the company does not have a signed contract for these services  the total value has not been agreed upon and there is still uncertainty surrounding the ultimate cash collection  the company did not recognize any related revenue for the additional work performed during fiscal however  the company has been diligently working on this and believes that these uncertainties will be resolved during fiscal  resulting in revenue recognition 
as a result of the decrease in revenues and increased costs  the company s gross margins decreased significantly from to for the current quarter and from to for the year ended april  versus the prior year comparable periods 
substantially all of the company s costs of revenue are fixed in nature  and relate primarily to employees who are needed to implement and support the software 
thus  gross margins fluctuate significantly with increases or decreases in net revenues 
as noted in previous filings  the company had been investing in its people and building a new infrastructure which the company believed was capable of supporting revenues up to million 
when quarterly revenues drop below million  gross margins are dramatically impacted 
on april   the company restructured its business which resulted in the elimination of sixty two positions or about of the workforce level the company had on february  in con nection with the reorganization  the company incurred a restructuring charge of  for both the three months and year ended april  see note of the notes to financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or from million to million for the three months ended april  and million or from million to million for the year ended april   in each case versus the prior year comparable periods 
the increases are primarily due to the amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in connection with the visicraft  plexis and asix acquisitions see note of the notes to financial statements 
amortization expense was  and  for the three months and year ended april  compared to  and  for the prior year comparable periods 
in addition  the company had increased its spending on sales and marketing during the year primarily on regional and national trade shows and conferences and in various marketing publications to further position manatron as the leading provider of property systems in north america 
finally  the company s non project related travel expenses have increased substantially over the prior year as the company has been pursuing business in new markets across the county  particularly in california and washington 
a substantial component of the company s selling  general and administrative expenses is its research and development costs 
as noted in more detail under financial condition and liquidity  these costs have increased from million to million during the fourth quarter and from million to million for the year ended april  versus the prior year comparable periods 
the increases in software development costs are primarily due to pay increases and additional personnel who were hired to accelerate the completion of the grm suite of software for the states and jurisdictions under current contracts 
as a result of the lower revenue  higher operating costs and restructuring charge  the company reported an operating loss for the three months ended april  of million compared to operating income of million for the three months ended april  the company also reported a loss from operations of million for the year ended april  versus income from operations of million for the year ended april as more fully described in note of the notes to financial statements  the company recorded a non recurring pre tax gain of million in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year related to the sale of its judicial product line  which impacted the results reported in this filing for the year ended april  while this has no impact on the fourth quarter or full year  it did significantly benefit the prior year s results and therefore  should be excluded from comparison purposes 
net other expense was  for the three months ended april  compared to net other income of  for the three months ended april  net other income was  and  for the years ended april  and  respectively 
this income consists of interest earned on the company s cash balances  as well as rental income associated with the lease of a portion of its corporate headquarters 
the decreases for both the three months and year ended april  are primarily due to the additional interest expense the company has incurred in connection with seller financed notes payable related to the company s recent acquisitions 
the company s provision credit for income taxes generally fluctuates with the level of pre tax income or loss 
the effective tax rate was and for the three months ended april  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was and for the years ended april  and  respectively 
the company reported a net loss of million or per diluted share for the fourth quarter in the current fiscal year versus net income of  or per diluted share for the fourth quarter in the prior fiscal year 
for the year ended april   the company reported a net loss of million or per diluted share versus net income of million or per diluted share for the year ended april  approximately million of the prior year net income or per diluted share was attributable to the divestiture of the judicial product line described in note of the notes to financial statements 
the net gain on this sale was calculated using an effective tax rate of for fiscal diluted weighted average outstanding common shares increased by approximately  and  shares for the three months and year ended april   respectively over the prior year comparable periods 
these increases were primarily due to the  shares of company stock issued in connection with the asix acquisition 
in addition  due to the loss position for both the three months and year ended april   the company utilized the weighted average basic shares outstanding for both the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations 
had the company reported net income for these periods  diluted weighted average shares would have increased by  and  shares for the three months and year ended april  versus the respective prior year periods 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year total net revenues of million for the three months ended april  were higher than the million of net revenues reported for the three months ended april  total net revenues for the year ended april  increased by to million versus million for the year ended april  the following paragraphs explain the components of the company s revenues and the reasons for the net increases in more detail 
application software license fees increased by  to million for the three months and by million to million for the year ended april   compared to the three months and year ended april  related professional service revenues decreased by  to million for the three months ended april   versus the three months ended april  and increased by  to million for the year ended april   versus the year ended april  these increases were primarily due to the recognition of license and service revenue on several projects  including gwinnett county  georgia  duval county  florida  the arizona department of revenue  davidson county  tennessee  and the city of virginia beach  virginia 
the company went live with the assessment administration  personal property  proval and records components of its grm product in gwinnett county  georgia during the second quarter of fiscal as part of its phase one delivery of that project 
this was a significant milestone that also contributed to the increase in software license fees and professional service revenues during the second quarter of fiscal since this contract was being accounted for under the percentage of completion method  there was approximately  of additional revenue recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal from this project 
the company installed manatron tax and began the implementation of this software in the duval county tax collector s office during the third quarter of fiscal this resulted in the recognition of approximately  of license and service revenue during the third quarter of fiscal this was a new contract with the city of jacksonville  florida that totaled million over five years 
an additional  of license and service revenue was recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company began the implementation and installed its cama software for the department of revenue in the state of arizona in fiscal  resulting in approximately  of license and service revenue during the third quarter of fiscal the company recognized an additional  of revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal associated with this implementation 
this was the company s first contract in arizona  totaling million over a seven year period and covered all but three counties in the state 
the city of virginia beach signed a contract in november for the company s new grm system totaling million over six years 
this was the first manatron tax account in virginia and was also a new account for manatron cama 
the company had other cities and counties in virginia using manatron cama 
this project began during the third quarter of fiscal and resulted in approximately  of revenue during that quarter 
installation of the company s cama software took place during the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting in approximately  of license and professional service revenue 
the company installed manatron tax and began the implementation of this software in the davidson county trustee s office during the fourth quarter of fiscal this resulted in the recognition of approximately million of license and service revenue during the quarter 
this was a new contract with the city of nashville  tennessee that totaled million over five years 
the company signed its fourth contract in idaho for manatron tax during fiscal these four contracts totaled million over five years 
all four counties were users of manatron cama along with an additional of the counties in that state 
idaho was a new state and target market for manatron tax 
the company also obtained approval from the state of idaho for other counties to order off the same rfp that was used for the initial counties 
these implementations resulted in approximately  of revenue recognition for the fourth quarter of fiscal the company also made additional progress within its core ohio market during the fourth quarter of fiscal which resulted in the recognition of approximately  of license and service revenue 
implementations of the company s tax and cama software began in champaign county and mahoning county during the second quarter of fiscal and in belmont county and wood county during the third quarter of fiscal progress also continued in delaware on cuyahoga and hamilton counties throughout fiscal appraisal services revenues increased by  to million for the three months and by  to million for the year ended april   versus the three months and year ended april  the fiscal annual amount included  of non recurring appraisal services revenues related to the settlement of the allegheny county lawsuit 
when this non recurring event was excluded  the increase in revenue for fiscal would have been even greater 
the increase in software license and professional service revenues noted above for fiscal  were partially offset by the following items first  the company completed the divestiture of its judicial product line effective may  this followed the divestiture of the financial product line effective may  these divestitures negatively impacted revenues for the three months and year ended april  by approximately  and million  respectively 
the fiscal fourth quarter included  of revenue associated with these product lines  while the fiscal fourth quarter only included  of revenue 
the year ended april  included million of revenue associated with these product lines  while the year ended april  only included  these divestitures did however result in substantial one time gains of million and million for the years ended april  and  respectively 
second  hardware and third party software sales increased by  for the three months ended april   but decreased by  for the year ended april   compared to the three months and year ended april  hardware and third party software sales totaled  and million for the three months and year ended april   respectively  and  and million for the three months and year ended april   respectively 
the increase in the fourth quarter over the prior year was primarily due to the timing of several contract renewals within the illinois market  which included new hardware and hardware upgrades 
third  the company had been working as a subcontractor for unisys for over a year to develop and implement a new property tax solution for the city of baltimore 
this was a multi year project valued at approximately million 
the city identified a number of new requirements for the software just prior to the scheduled go live date in june  which impacted the project 
while the company utilized the percentage of completion method to recognize revenue on this project  the go live date was a major milestone that would have triggered the recognition of additional revenue 
as a result  no revenue was recognized on this project during the third or fourth quarters of fiscal and only approximately  was recognized during fiscal the company has been working through change orders with unisys and the city for these additional requirements 
despite the improvements in software license fees and related professional service revenues during the second half of fiscal  total net revenues for the year were still below the company s expectations 
while proposal activity appeared to be increasing  sales for fiscal decreased to million from million for fiscal much of this decrease was due to the cyclicality of appraisal services in ohio as sales of software  hardware and related services were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal more importantly  of the million in software  hardware and related services that was signed during fiscal  million or of this amount was to new clients 
historically  the majority of the company s sales had been to existing clients 
the company s backlog for software and related services decreased slightly from million at april  to million as of april  the backlog for appraisal services decreased from million at april  to as of april   due to the cyclicality of this business 
as of april   recurring revenues stood at million on an annualized basis or approximately of total revenues 
cost of revenues increased by from million to million for the three months ended april  and by from million to million for the year ended april   compared to the three months and year ended april   respectively 
costs associated with employees who left in connection with the judicial and financial product line divestitures noted previously were lower 
in addition  costs of hardware and third party software sales were also lower due to the decrease in the associated revenues 
however  these reductions were offset by additional costs of revenues related to project managers and other personnel who were hired during fiscal to work on many of the significant projects signed prior to april  secondly  salaries and benefits for customer service personnel increased over fiscal  primarily due to annual raises and bonuses 
thirdly  the company had to utilize subcontractors to assist with the execution of the baltimore project  which contributed to significant cost overruns on that contract
