item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview omnicell  inc was incorporated in california in under the name omnicell technologies  inc and reincorporated in delaware in as omnicell  inc our healthcare automation solutions enable healthcare facilities to acquire  manage  dispense and administer medications and medical surgical supplies  and are intended to enhance patient safety  reduce medication errors  improve workflow and increase operational efficiency 
our medication dispensing and supply automation systems facilitate the distribution of medications and medical surgical supplies at the point of care 
our physician order management system streamlines communication between nursing and pharmacy staff 
our web based procurement application automates and integrates healthcare facilities requisition and approval processes 
these systems interface with healthcare facilities existing information systems to accurately capture and display critical patient data 
when used in combination  our products and services offer a comprehensive solution to enable healthcare facilities to enhance patient safety while improving operational efficiency 
we sell our medication dispensing and supply automation systems primarily in the united states 
we have a direct sales force organized into six geographic regions in the united states 
we sell through distributors in asia  australia  europe  the middle east  and south america and through a sales agent in canada 
we manufacture the majority of our systems in our production facility in mountain view  california  with refurbishment and spare parts activities conducted in our waukegan  illinois facility 
in august of  we opened a facility in bangalore  india and established a wholly owned subsidiary  omnicell corporation india private limited 
the function of this entity has initially been focused on software product development but may expand into other operations over time 
the subsidiary was staffed by a workforce of approximately engineers and support staff at end of  approximately of whom transferred to omnicell from the third party contractor that had been supplying these development resources in the past 
we believe that our new operation gives us access to an excellent talent base and in conjunction with our domestic team  will enable us to scale our research and development and service investments most efficiently for the foreseeable future 
we recognize revenue when our medication dispensing and supply automation systems are installed 
installation generally takes place three to six months after our systems are ordered 
the installation process at our customers sites includes internal procedures associated with large capital expenditures and the time associated with adopting new technologies 
given the length of time necessary for our customers to plan for and complete their acceptance of the installation of omnicell systems  our focus is on shipping products based on the installation dates requested by our customers and working at the customers pace 
this has resulted in us growing product backlog which has the benefit of enabling us to operate more efficiently and predictably 
in  we focused on running our business more efficiently  cost effectively  and with greater emphasis on market share expansion 
we believe that a key to realizing these efficiencies is to improve the linearity of our business within each quarter 
focusing our operational model on working at the customers pace has allowed our backlog to grow  enabling us to maintain a more predictable level of production and more predictable installation schedules for ourselves and our customers 
we believe this helps us reduce our costs  which enables us to compete more aggressively in the marketplace and deliver better stockholder value 
product backlog product backlog is the dollar amount of medication dispensing and supply automation systems that has shipped to customers but is not yet installed at the customer site plus the dollar amount of such systems that has not shipped but for which we have purchase orders 
to facilitate excellent customer service through the timely delivery of our products and services  we anticipate our product backlog will build over time as our business grows 
our backlog was million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we have policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as revenue recognition  which are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
in addition  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable  accounting for sales of accounts receivable  valuation of inventory  purchased residual interests which are included within other assets  assessment of impairment of goodwill and accrued sure med upgrade costs 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy significantly impacts our results of operations because it determines the timing of when revenue is recognized 
it also impacts the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions  as they are determined by the timing of the recognition of corresponding revenues 
we follow specific and detailed policies on recognizing revenue 
revenue results are difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
revenues are derived primarily from sales of medication dispensing and supply automation systems and subsequent service agreements 
the company markets these systems for sale with day or multi year payment terms 
medication dispensing and supply automation system sales  which are accounted for in accordance with american institute of certified public accountant s statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered and installations are complete  omnicell s price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our product revenue is derived from the sale and installation of medication dispensing and automation systems 
we ship our systems based on customer requested installation dates 
our field operations employees generally perform system installations 
the installations are considered complete and revenue is recognizable when the database files are complete  the systems are configured and labeled  our software is installed and deemed functional  the basic interfaces are complete  the systems are in the customer designated locations and the systems have been tested 
we further require our customers to confirm that we have completed our installation obligations by providing to us a customer certification form indicating the date our installation obligations  if any  were completed 
delays at a customer site due to construction or other causes could result in our inability to install  and therefore recognize revenue 
we also sell our medication dispensing and supply automation systems through distributors in europe  the middle east  asia and australia and through a sales agent in canada 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of our systems to distributors when the distributors have specific purchase orders from identified end users 
revenues from multi year payment arrangements are recognized upon completion of our installation obligation  if any  and at the beginning of the non cancelable payment term 
most of our multi year payment receivables are sold to third party leasing finance companies 
we record revenue at the net present value of the payment stream utilizing an implicit interest rate comparable to those charged by a third party leasing company 
we exclude from revenues any amount paid to us for a new sale that relates to the termination of an existing payment stream 
generally  we have no obligation to the leasing company once the receivable is sold 
in  and  sales of medication dispensing and supply automation systems sold under multi year payment agreements totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in  and  customer lease receivables sold to third party leasing companies totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
at december  and  accounts receivable included approximately million and million  respectively  due from finance companies for lease receivables sold 
us government customers sign five year non cancelable payment terms but are subject to one year government budget funding cycles 
in our judgment and based on our history with these accounts  we believe these receivables are collectible 
however  in the future  if any of our us government customers do not receive their annual funding  the ability to collect payments on unsold leases could be impaired and may result in a write down of our unsold leases to us government customers 
further  it could impair our ability to make additional sales to us government customers and impair our ability to sell these receivables to third party leasing companies 
as of december   the balance of our unsold leases to us government customers was million 
post installation technical support  such as phone support  on site service  parts and access to software upgrades  when and if available  is provided by us under separate support services terms 
when support services are sold under multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to support services based on its fair value 
we recognize revenue for support services ratably over the related support services contract period 
in addition  we enter into professional services and training arrangements 
we recognize revenue for these arrangements upon performance of such services 
deferred service revenue represents amounts received under service agreements for which the services have not yet been performed 
accounts receivable we actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize credit risk 
we typically sell to customers for which there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subject to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial position and ability to pay 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated could differ materially from what will actually be uncollectible in the future 
sales of accounts receivable we offer our customers multi year  non cancelable payment terms 
we typically sell our customers multi year payment agreements to a third party leasing company 
in these sales  we generally transfer customer accounts receivable to the leasing company on a non recourse basis at our book value so no gain is recorded on the transfer 
in these non recourse transfers  we remove the sold receivable from our assets as we have assessed that the sales should be accounted for as true sales in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
if we have overestimated the amount of the receivable sales that should be recorded in this way  our assets and liabilities would need to be increased 
during the fiscal years ended december   and  we transferred accounts receivable totaling million  million and million  respectively  which approximated fair value  to leasing companies on a non recourse basis 
due to the nature of the recourse clauses in certain of our sales arrangements  we have recorded million of our total sold receivable portfolio of million as of december and million of our total sold receivable portfolio of million as of december  as receivables subject to a sales agreement and obligation resulting from sale of receivables due to recourse clauses in those certain sale arrangements 
inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
other assets purchased residual interests the value of purchased residual interests included in other assets at december  and was million and million  respectively 
although we had no contractual obligation to do so  in july we executed an agreement to purchase from americorp financial  inc  or afi  all residual interests in our equipment covered by multi year payment agreements financed by afi 
the total purchase price was million 
the purchase price was assigned to the acquired payment residual interests based on the original implied payment residual value  equipment type and our assessment of the customers likelihood of renewal at the end of the payment term 
as equipment is renewed or upgraded  we charge the assigned value to cost of product revenues 
when equipment is not renewed or upgraded at the end of the contract or when we believe a renewal is unlikely  the assigned value is written off 
the payment streams associated with the purchased residual interests expire at various dates within four years from the date of the purchase agreement 
purchased residual interests are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows 
if actual demand  market condition or timing of new products introductions differ from those projected by management  the value of purchased residual interests could become significantly impaired 
impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets at december  we had goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives of million 
in accordance with the sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we measure such assets for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
no impairment of goodwill or purchased intangibles with indefinite lives was recognized for the years ended december   or at december  we had purchased intangible assets with finite lives of million 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives include software and customer relationships acquired in a business combination 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives of five or six years 
additionally  these intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows 
no impairment of these intangible assets was recognized for the years ended december   or accrued liabilities accrued liabilities are based on our judgment of estimated future costs for goods or services already received or obligations incurred 
actual costs may differ from those estimates 
our estimates for accrued customer upgrade costs of million and million as of december  and  respectively  required a significant amount of judgment related to forecasted costs of materials  labor  travel and other costs required to fulfill upgrade obligations to certain sure med customers 
our estimates can and have changed based on actual costs incurred in completing these obligations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items included in our results of operations for the years ended december   and  expressed as a percentage of our total revenues for these periods year ended december  statement of operations product revenues service and other revenues total revenues cost of product revenues cost of service and other revenues total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring and facility charges total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss product revenues  cost of product revenues and gross profit year ended december  in thousands product revenues cost of product revenues gross profit product revenues decreased by million  or in compared to during the third quarter of  the company implemented a major realignment of our direct sales force dividing them into a product focused sales organization  with sales representatives selling either medication or supply products 
this was done to bring more focus to our supply products offerings 
this in turn created disruptions in the sales process and led to delays in customers placing orders during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of this was a major contributor to lower product revenues in the first half of in addition  at the end of the first quarter of  the company made a decision to change its business model to slow the pace of installations to improve the customer experience in working with omnicell 
this led to a significant growth in product order backlog as customer demand rebounded during the second quarter of and throughout the remainder of working with a sizable backlog has enabled the company to distribute the installation of our products more evenly across the quarter and run the company much more efficiently creating a win win situation for our customers and omnicell 
product revenues increased by million  or  in compared to the increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of medication  dispensing and supply automation system installations  an increase in revenue associated with our provision of software programs that interface our systems with our customers systems  and an increase in revenue from multi year payment arrangements resulting in an increase in the size of the average customer purchase transaction 
in addition  part of this increase can be attributed to our emphasis on closing larger and more complex transactions with larger healthcare facilities and to the strength of our expanding market position 
we also experienced strong contributions from our new product lines 
cost of product revenues increased by million or in as compared to the increase was partially due to a higher mix of other equipment manufacturer  or oem  product whose costs are relatively higher as a percent of revenue than product we manufacture ourselves 
for example  hardware for our central pharmacy products which we oem carries higher relative costs than our core cabinet products and we sold higher numbers of these central pharmacy products in compared to this increase was partially offset by lower costs associated with our china sourcing strategy 
gross profit on product sales was million or of product revenues in compared to million and of product revenues in a major contributor to the year over year decline in the margin percent was the one time charge of million taken in first quarter of to write off excess inventory associated with the end of our suremed product line 
from an ongoing operations standpoint  we experienced a decline in lease renewal revenues year over year  which yield higher margins than the sale of new equipment 
additionally  we achieved growth in our emerging products business compared to the hardware component of several of our emerging products are supplied through third party oem agreements and therefore carry a higher product cost and lower gross margin than our internally designed and manufactured systems 
to the extent that we are successful at broadening our product base through these products  it puts downward pressure on our gross margins 
lastly  we earned lower margins on several major competitive product wins which were installed in the first half of these new account sales are often won with targeted negotiations on pricing and deliverables which yield lower initial profits in the near term but higher profits from follow on orders and account penetration after the initial installation cost of product revenues increased by million  or  in compared to gross profit on product sales was million  or of product revenues in as compared to million  or of product revenues in the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of product revenues in as compared to was attributable to the increase in headcount and temporary labor  in part required by the installation of units near the end of the quarter that had only been ordered earlier in the same quarter  an increase in charges related to the renewal of existing multi year payment term agreements related to purchased residuals  price compression due  in part  to large  competitive deals  an increased mix of lower margin product installations  and to increased inventory charges related to the build up and reduction of our inventory 
we expect the cost of product revenues to increase consistently with our product revenue growth 
service and other revenues  cost of service and other revenues and gross profit year ended december  in thousands service and other revenues cost of service and other revenues gross profit service and other revenues include revenues from service and maintenance contracts  rentals of automation systems and monthly subscription fees from hospitals  whose information systems are connected to our web based procurement application 
service and other revenues increased by million  or  in compared to  and increased by million  or  in compared to the increases in and from the prior years were primarily due to the increase in our installed base of automation systems combined with an increase in the number of multi year payment term sales with service contracts 
cost of service and other revenues increased by million  or  in compared to  and increased by million  or  in compared to the increase in cost of service and other revenues in as compared to is due to costs associated with the growth of certain of our emerging product lines for installation and support services and for increased material costs used in supporting the installed base 
gross profit on service and other revenues was million  or of service and other revenues in  compared to million  or of service and other revenues in the increase in gross profit margin on service and other revenues in as compared to reflects a reduction in cost from the transition from an outsourced service model to an internal service organization which was completed in we believe that cost of service and other revenues will continue to fluctuate based on our ability to improve cost efficiencies from our internal service organization 
gross profit on service and other revenues was million  or of service and other revenues in  compared to million  or of service and other revenues in the increase in gross profit margin on service and other revenues in as compared to was predominantly a result of increased revenues from the roll out of multi tiered pricing packages for premium services 
the increase also reflects a reduction in cost from the transition from an outsourced service model to an internal service organization  partially offset by increased costs due to the change to the service call center model which provides extended hours of coverage to customers 
we believe that cost of service and other revenues will continue to fluctuate based on our ability to improve cost efficiencies from our internal service organization 
we believe that cost of service and other revenues will continue to fluctuate based on our ability to improve cost efficiencies from our internal service organization 
operating expenses year ended december  in thousands research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring  facility and severance charges total operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  in compared to and which increased by million  or in compared to research and development expenses represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expense was due primarily to a lower amount of capitalized software as compared to in  we capitalized million  and in  we capitalized million of development costs related to software implemented in our medication dispensing and supply automation systems and incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
there were no such costs capitalized in we determine technology feasibility to occur when products enter beta testing at customer sites and continues until official release of the product to the general public 
during  the amount of time and resources dedicated to supporting beta testing was significantly reduced as we made progress in our development processes 
each year  we attempt to provide upgraded functionality in all of our product offerings 
since  we have increased spending on software development  cost reduction initiatives for which we will receive future benefits such as product documentation and integration of acquired technology  and engineering endeavors to improve on product quality and reliability 
in august  we opened an office and wholly owned subsidiary in bangalore  india when we acquired the workforce of a third party technology partner focused initially on software development and quality assurance 
we anticipate that we will continue to commit significant resources to research and development in future periods to enhance and extend our product and new feature offerings and will benefit from the lower cost structure and access to technological talent through our india operations 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in compared to and increased by million  or  in compared to selling  general and administrative expenses represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
approximately million of the increase reflects costs associated with an increase in sales headcount starting in mid in addition  during the first quarter of  we incurred million in costs associated with our previously announced reduction in force  million of which is included in restructuring and other charges as discussed below 
an additional million in the year over year increase reflects increases in accounting  legal and regulatory compliance fees and million was due to the write off of costs associated with abandoned acquisitions 
the remainder of the year over year increase was due to normal inflation and other miscellaneous increases 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or compared to this increase reflects higher headcount in to support targeted increases in revenues and bookings and our continued growth  as well as costs related to regulatory compliance requirements 
we increased headcount in our selling  general and administrative areas by approximately from december  to december   with most of the growth concentrated in sales and customer service functions 
restructuring and facility charges 
restructuring and facility charges were million in  million in and million in in the first quarter of  we initiated a restructuring to reduce costs  improve operational efficiencies and realign omnicell to a new strategic direction 
as part of this restructuring  we reduced our headcount by approximately or employees  including in research and development and in selling  general and administrative positions 
we incurred million in restructuring and other charges during the first quarter of  all of which was paid out by the end of such quarter 
in and  we restructured our organization to reduce costs and improve operational efficiencies 
as part of this restructuring  we reduced headcount by in and in respectively 
income taxes we use the liability method for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
taxes are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense 
year ended december  in thousands provision for income taxes due to net operating loss carry forwards available to us  we recorded minimal total federal and state income tax expense in  and as of december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any 
due to our recent operating history  we concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
accordingly  we have provided a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
in the event that these attributes are recognized in the future  income tax expense will be reduced by million and million will be credited to additional paid in capital for the benefit associated with stock option deductions 
segment information we report segments in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas requires the use of a management approach in identifying segments of an enterprise 
prior to  the company consisted of one operating segment medication and supply dispensing systems 
a second operating segment was created in the second half of with the introduction of our e commerce business 
our chief operating decision maker reviews information pertaining to reportable segments to the operating income level 
there are no significant inter segment sales or transfers 
assets and capital expenditures of the operating segments are not segregated and substantially all of our long lived assets are located in the united states

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity  which include cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  totaled approximately million as of december  this represented a decrease of million compared to million as of december  the majority of our funds are currently invested in us commercial and government debt securities 
net cash used in operating activities was million during compared to million used in we had a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in apart from the reduction in net income in  the increase in cash flow from operating activities of million in compared to resulted from cash positive movements in inventories  other assets  deferred gross profit  deferred service revenue and prepaid expenses  offset by an increase in accounts payable 
in particular  gross inventories increased significantly less in than in  resulting in the generation of cash of million 
this smaller increase was due primarily to a reduction in same quarter sales and installations and more predictability of demand from the higher backlog 
other assets declined million less in than in due primarily to the expiration of in house leases  although million of such decline represents a reclass from the long term portion of such leases to a short term portion  having an equal and opposite effect on prepaid assets 
prepaid assets increased by million during but more cash was generated compared to due to a reduction in prepaid commissions 
a total of million lower cash usage in compared to was a result of the reduced emphasis on same quarter sales and shipments  which caused a smaller reduction in deferred product revenue and cost 
deferred service revenue increased by million in compared to  due to an increase in service contracts  particularly relating to emerging businesses such as omnicell pharmacycentral and related products 
we generated net cash from investing activities of million during  compared to million net cash used during we reduced our purchases of short term investments by million in compared to  but at the same time the maturity of such instruments declined by million

the main source of cash during and was million and million respectively in net proceeds from common stock issuances upon exercise of employee stock options and common stock issuances under our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe our current cash balances and cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures at least through however  if demand for our products and services does not continue as currently anticipated  we may be required to raise additional capital through the public equity market  private financings  collaborative arrangements or debt 
in addition  in certain circumstances we may decide that it is in our best interests to raise additional capital to take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity  our stockholders may experience dilution  and such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing  or to obtain it on acceptable terms  we may be unable to execute our business plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we reduce the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining an investment portfolio which is comprised solely of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
we are not exposed to currency exchange fluctuations when we sell our products internationally as we manage the sensitivity of our international sales by denominating all transactions in us dollars 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high quality institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
we classify our short term investments as fixed rate if the rate of return on such instruments remains fixed over their term 
these fixed rate investments include fixed rate us government securities and corporate obligations with contractual maturity dates of less than one year 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates of our short term investments at december  and dollars in thousands  except percentage rates 
short term investments were as of december due to the maturation of all previous cash investments in december and no new investments were made prior to the end of the year
