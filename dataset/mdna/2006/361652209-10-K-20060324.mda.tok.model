business environment our business generally benefits from robust trading volume and volatility in the markets we serve 
trading volume in many of our markets is driven by the trading activity of our dealer customers that  in turn  are responsive to the trading activity and demand of their buy side customers 
those buy side customers include smaller banks  insurance companies and financial institutions  investment funds  trading firms and  increasingly  hedge funds 
in  hedge funds numbered approximately  globally and managed more than trillion at year end  up from an estimated million in however  net inflows to hedge funds slowed considerably in to billion from billion in  as lower hedge fund returns made investors more selective in their investment decisions 
during  the global business environment was generally positive for our business  with satisfactory volume levels and generally modest volatility in global equity and foreign exchange markets  and instances of more pronounced volatility in certain global credit and energy markets 
market volatility is driven by a range of external and internal factors  some of which are market specific and some of which are correlated to macro economic conditions 
the credit markets experienced some marked volatility events in including credit downgrades and bankruptcy filings in the us auto and auto parts  airline and selected industrial sectors  terrorist attacks in london  the devastation from dennis  katrina  rita and other hurricanes  and the federal reserve bank raising short term interest rates a total of two percentage points by year end 
despite these events  bond prices remained high and yields remained low 
the year treasury note  a barometer for long term interest rates  increased slightly to for year end versus at the beginning of nasd trace  a reporting system that tracks trading activity in us investment grade  high yield and convertible bonds  reported volumes decreased from according to the bond market association  corporate bond issuance in the us decreased to billion in  as strong corporate results reduced the need for debt financing 
however  the size of the markets for over the counter otc credit derivatives continued to expand as illustrated by the notional value of global outstanding otc credit derivatives which increased at year end from trillion to trillion  according to the latest international swaps and derivatives association isda market survey 
the combination of strong growth in the otc credit derivatives markets with instances of heightened volatility in certain corporate bond sectors in which we provide services positively affected both our credit derivatives and corporate bond revenues in more modest volatility in the global foreign exchange markets during was likely attributable to a number of factors including significant economic damage from hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita which led to a short period of uncertainty regarding the direction of the us economy and short term interest rates  the federal reserve instituted rate increases throughout the year raising short term rates to from  and inflationary pressure due to high energy costs 
despite these factors and a widening of the us trade deficit  the us dollar enjoyed its best performance in four years as foreign capital sought to take advantage of higher relative interest rates  substantial multinational company profit repatriation supported the currency and decreased the demand for the euro due to the european union s inability to reach consensus decreased the demand for the euro 
according to the latest isda market survey  the value of notional amounts outstanding for interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps grew to trillion at year end the us dollar index  which tracks us dollar movements versus a basket of six currencies  rose 
the us dollar performed particularly well versus the japanese yen and the euro 
substantial volatility worldwide in non us currencies worldwide against the us dollar benefited our business 
equity market volatility increased in as evidenced by increases in the chicago board options exchange cboe standard poor s p volatility and cboe dow jones industrial average djia volatility indices 
strong global corporate earnings gains and low interest rates in were partially offset by higher oil prices  rising short term interest rates and the economic aftermath of strong hurricanes in the us corporate restructuring in europe and japan helped push their stock markets higher  while strong economic growth benefited asian emerging markets and latin american commodity producers capitalized on higher natural resource prices 
international stock markets outperformed the us stock markets with the dow jones world index increasing in versus in comparison  the s p index grew while the djia retreated over the same period 
trading volume of s p and djia stocks increased and  respectively 
similar volume increases were witnessed on the major german and japanese indices 
the latest isda survey indicated notional amounts outstanding for equity derivatives grew over to trillion 
our equity business benefited from both the overall positive global corporate results and the increase in the number of our equities brokerage clients in the hedge fund sector 
more pronounced energy market volatility in resulted from the combination of oil and natural gas supply disruptions caused by hurricanes  continued middle east tensions  and strong overall demand 
these factors drove oil product prices to record highs 
oil  natural gas and gold futures prices on the new york mercantile exchange nymex increased substantially in versus nymex crude oil futures  crude oil options and natural gas futures contracts increased  and  respectively  in versus similarly  the intercontinental securities exchange reported brent crude oil contract volume up versus many of the factors above contributed to our revenue increases in oil  natural gas  and other commodity products 
financial overview our revenues have grown from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the main factors contributing to our growth were the net addition of brokerage desks during the three year period ended december   resulting in an increase in brokerage personnel consisting of brokers  trainees and clerks from brokerage personnel at january  to brokerage personnel at december   a continued focus on  and investment in  growing and higher margin product areas  as well as product areas that complement our existing brokerage services  overall volume growth in the markets in which we provide brokerage services  the introduction and continued expansion of our hybrid brokerage capabilities  and the development of our data and analytical products 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily through our inter dealer brokerage services and the fees we charge for certain of our data and analytics products 
brokerage revenues brokerage revenues represent revenues generated from our brokerage transactions 
we provide brokerage services to our clients in the form of either agency or principal transactions 
in agency transactions  we charge a commission for connecting buyers and sellers and assisting in the negotiation of the price and other material terms of the transaction 
after all material terms of a transaction are agreed upon  we identify the buyer and seller to each other and they then settle the trade directly 
commissions charged to our clients in agency transactions vary across the products for which we provide brokerage services 
commissions from agency transactions represented approximately   and of our total brokerage revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
commissions from agency transactions are recognized on the date on which the related trade is made 
however  we do not receive our commissions until our invoice is paid by the client 
clients are invoiced on a monthly basis 
we generate revenue from principal transactions on the spread between the buy and sell price of the security that is brokered 
our principal transactions revenue is primarily derived from matched principal transactions 
in matched principal transactions  we act as a middleman by serving as counterparty for an identified buyer and an identified seller in matching reciprocal back to back trades 
because the buyer and seller each settle their transactions with us rather than with each other  the parties are able to maintain their anonymity 
a very limited number of our brokerage desks are allowed to enter into unmatched principal transactions to facilitate a customer s execution needs for transactions initiated by such customers or for the purpose of proprietary trading to arbitrage the value between an exchange traded fund and its component securities 
these unmatched positions are intended to be held short term 
revenues from principal transactions are recognized on the date on which the trade is made 
generally  we do not receive our net proceeds until the settlement date of the transaction  typically one to three business days after the trade date 
revenue from principal transactions has been growing in total dollars but decreasing as a percentage of our total brokerage revenue and comprised approximately  and of our total brokerage revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in principal transactions as a percent of total brokerage revenues in was primarily due to significant growth in credit derivatives  financial and commodity revenues  all of which are primarily agency transactions 
the performance of our brokerage desks is largely dependent on a number of factors  including market developments affecting the products we broker  the size of transactions  the location of the markets  the terms of the instruments brokered  the currency of the instruments brokered  commission structure  competition  recruitment or departure of key brokers or customers  volatility and the level of trading activity in the various products that we broker 
additionally  as markets mature and have more participants  the resulting competition generally leads to lower commissions or spreads 
accordingly  our strategy is to continually seek new markets in which we can charge higher commissions  increase our market share and trading volumes in existing illiquid markets  and provide electronic capabilities to more liquid and commoditized markets in order to offset this potential downward pressure on our brokerage revenues 
we offer our brokerage services in four broad product categories credit  financial  equity and commodity 
the charts below detail our brokerage revenues by product category in dollars and as a percentage of our total brokerage revenues for the indicated periods 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands brokerage revenues credit financial equity commodity total brokerage revenues brokerage revenues credit financial equity commodity total brokerage revenues as the chart above indicates  our brokerage operations in the credit product category produced a significant percentage of our total brokerage revenues in each of the last three years 
we expect that revenues from credit brokerage operations will continue to constitute the largest percentage of our total brokerage revenues for the foreseeable future 
for the year ended december   the percentage of revenues from the credit product category increased slightly from the prior year due to factors including the increase in the number of brokerage personnel on our credit desks  the robust credit derivative business  our investment in and sectorization of both credit derivatives and corporate bonds  and continued customer development of correlation trading strategies 
we believe that brokerage revenues from our four brokerage categories will continue to fluctuate year to year based on  among other things  developments which are outside our control  such as the effects of bankruptcies and credit downgrades in the auto and auto supplies sectors on our corporate bond and credit derivatives business  and the success of initiatives by us to increase our presence in certain markets  such as the recent increase in the number of our equity brokerage desks to capitalize on correlation trading opportunities  the starsupply transaction and the distribution of our latest creditmatch platform in europe 
credit we provide our brokerage services in a wide range of markets for credit instruments  including credit derivatives  investment grade corporate bonds  high yield bonds and emerging market bonds 
the markets for credit derivatives  generally  and the market for credit default swaps  specifically  have experienced strong growth in the last three years 
as a result  more competitors have entered these markets 
increased competition has placed downward pressure on the commissions that we can charge  resulting in lower commission rates 
we expect this trend to continue in the markets for more widely traded credit derivative products  such as single entity credit default swaps 
partially in response to this trend  we have sought to establish and increase our presence in markets for newer credit derivative products that have fewer competitors and allow for higher commissions  and have developed the creditmatch platform to expand our presence in the more liquid existing credit derivatives products 
we have also sought to support an increasing movement among our clients to integrate transactions involving certain credit derivatives with other related or correlated financial instruments 
we believe this trend  together with our existing presence in the credit derivatives market  may permit us to expand our presence in the markets for these related or correlated financial instruments  some of which are in the credit products area and others of which are in the financial and equity product areas 
financial our financial products brokerage services cover a wide range of markets for financial instruments  including foreign exchange options  bond options and repurchase agreements 
our customers increased their trading of foreign exchange options in due to the increased volatility from higher short term interest rates  a stronger than expected us dollar  and economic and inflationary uncertainty caused by hurricanes dennis  katrina and rita 
over the past few years  we have expanded our presence in the financial products area by adding brokerage desks in markets for emerging market foreign exchange options  regional interest rate derivatives and non deliverable forwards contracts 
in addition  we expanded our operations in tokyo  in part  to capitalize on the growth trend in the asia pacific markets for financial products 
equity we provide brokerage services in a range of markets for equity products  including us equity  international equity  equity derivatives and gdrs and adrs 
recently  our clients have begun to integrate their trading of certain equity and credit derivative products  in an effort to exploit arbitrage opportunities that may arise from the volatility in price fluctuations of debt and equity instruments issued by a company 
in response to this trend and our relatively light presence in the equity product area compared to our other product categories  we added thirteen new equity brokerage desks globally during to increase our presence in the equity product market and expect our brokerage revenues in this area to increase as a result of the expansion in our product base 
commodity we provide brokerage services in a diverse array of markets for commodity products  including electricity  oil and oil products  natural gas  wet and dry freight derivatives  precious metals  coal  natural gas  weather derivatives  emissions and pulp and paper 
wet and dry freight derivatives  emissions and pulp and paper are examples of new product markets in which we have participated in the last few years as we continue to develop new markets 
enron corp 
and its affiliates were active participants in several of the energy product areas in which we provide brokerage services 
the bankruptcies of enron corp 
and other energy companies in late and caused a disruption in the global energy markets  which resulted in  among other things  several market participants ceasing or reducing their level of trading activity 
this decrease in energy market participants began to fully evidence itself in the second half of and was primarily responsible for the approximately decrease in our brokerage revenues from our commodity products area for the year ended december  compared to since  we have seen an increase in activity in the energy markets in the us and europe as large financial institutions  primarily investment banks  entered the markets and some of the large energy firms recommended their trading of energy products 
analytics and market data in addition to revenues from our brokerage services  we also earn revenues from the sale of our analytics and market data products 
we offer our clients analytics and market data products which are used to build pricing models  develop trading strategies and price and revalue their derivative positions 
our fenics fx calculator is a widely used analytical tool in the foreign exchange markets 
we generate revenues from software licenses  data subscription fees and upgrade maintenance fees associated with our analytics and market data products offerings 
for software licenses  we charge our clients up front  one time license fees and annual and monthly subscription fees 
we also charge upgrade fees that are generally treated as follow on licenses 
we sell our data either on a subscription fee basis or in customized one time sales 
our analytics and market data products are marketed to a broader range of clients than are our brokerage services  including national and regional banks  large corporations and hedge funds 
interest income we generate interest income primarily from the investment of our cash balances and from interest earned on balances held at third party clearing organizations 
we currently invest our cash in highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less 
other income other income primarily consists of transactional gains losses based on foreign currency fluctuations and gains losses on foreign exchange derivative contracts 
additionally  we have historically included income received by us from non recurring items such as litigation settlements  insurance settlements  gains on the sale of a non strategic brokerage desk  and other non recurring items 
other income also includes income recognized from technology hosting services we provide to a third party 
expenses compensation and employee benefits our principal operating cost is our compensation and employee benefits expense  which includes salaries  sign on bonuses  incentive compensation and related employee benefits and taxes 
our employees can be allocated into three general categories brokerage employees  data and analytics products employees and administrative and support employees  which include our executive officers 
the most significant component of our overall compensation and employee benefits expense is the employment costs of our brokerage personnel 
our compensation and employee benefits expense for all employees has both a fixed and variable component 
base salaries and benefit costs are primarily fixed for all employees 
employees also receive bonuses  which constitute the variable portion of our compensation and employee benefits expense 
bonuses for brokerage personnel are primarily based on the operating results of their related brokerage desk as well as their individual performance 
for many of our brokerage employees  their bonus constitutes a significant component of their overall compensation 
bonuses for other employees generally are more broadly based on our overall performance 
for most of these employees  the bonus is typically a smaller component of their overall compensation than is the case for our brokerage personnel 
accordingly  bonus costs  and therefore compensation and employee benefits expense  are variable and normally rise and fall in relation to our brokerage revenues 
a significant portion of brokerage bonuses are typically paid semi annually in march for the six month period ending december of the prior year  and in september  for the six month period ending june of that year 
bonuses expensed to all employees represented  and of total compensation and employee benefits expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in these amounts are guaranteed bonuses  which represented  and of total bonuses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
additionally  we grant sign on bonuses for certain newly hired brokers or for certain of our existing brokers who agree to long term employment agreements 
these sign on bonuses may be paid in the form of cash  restricted stock units rsus or forgivable loans and are typically amortized over the term of the related employment agreement  which is generally two to four years 
these employment agreements typically contain repayment or forfeiture provisions for unvested rsus or all or a portion of the sign on bonus and forgivable loan should the employee voluntarily terminate his or her employment or if the employee s employment is terminated for cause during the initial term of the agreement 
sign on bonuses expensed to all employees represented  and of total compensation and employee benefits expense for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe that in certain situations  we can expand our business into strategic product areas through recruitment of experienced brokers who can build successful brokerage desks 
such recruitment may cause us to incur upfront signing bonuses which increase current and future compensation expense as such compensation expense is generally recognized over a two to four year period 
during  we incurred increased compensation expense for sign on bonuses in order to recruit key brokers for the strategic expansion of our brokerage operations in the equity and credit product areas 
compensation expenses relating to sign on bonuses have increased in to a level that is substantially higher than historical levels as we further expanded into new product areas 
in the current period and the foreseeable future  we intend to continue to pursue strategic expansion opportunities by using our cash or common stock or a combination thereof to hire brokers or acquire brokerage businesses 
we pay the brokerage personnel in our uk office in british pounds 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates because most of the revenues associated with our uk operations are received in euros and us dollars 
we have attempted to mitigate this exposure by introducing a policy in which provides that bonuses earned for all brokerage personnel in our uk office will be calculated in uk dollars but paid in foreign currency equivalents 
compensation and employee benefits expense also includes expenses related to employee stock options and rsus 
options issued prior to january  under our stock option plan were accounted for using the intrinsic method with compensation expense arising upon issuance of options with exercise prices below the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant and totaling approximately million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the options issued under our stock option plan were not exercisable until the consummation of the ipo on january  all options issued prior to january  under our stock option plan were modified in the second quarter of to extend the term of each option 
options issued or modified on or after january  are accounted for using the fair value method provided by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 pursuant to which we expense the fair value measured at the date of grant  or incremental fair value measured at the date of modification  over the related vesting period 
as these options were not exercisable until consummation of the ipo  the fair value calculated as of the date of grant or modification was recorded in january to the extent vested 
for the year ended december   a total non cash compensation charge of approximately million was recorded related to stock options granted under the stock option plan 
additionally  during  we issued rsus to compensate our employees in connection with certain performance and sign on bonuses 
the rsus issued were measured at fair value based on the market value of our common stock at the date of grant and the related compensation expenses is recognized over their respective vesting term  which is generally over three years 
for the year ended december   a total non cash compensation charge of approximately million was recorded related to rsus 
communications and quotes our communications expense consists primarily of costs for our voice and data connections with our clients and clearing agents 
these costs generally increase as we add new brokerage desks and clients 
however  we have seen a general reduction in telecommunications rates in recent years  which we attribute to competition in the telecommunications industry 
our quote systems expense consists primarily of fees for access to market data and related services  primarily provided by reuters and bloomberg 
many of these costs are fixed because these systems are required regardless of transaction volume 
further  many of our quote systems vendors require one to two year service contracts 
we have expanded our presence in certain equity products which require greater usage of information data systems and trade reporting systems 
as a result  we expect quote systems expense to increase in the future 
travel and promotion travel and promotion expenses related to our brokerage clients include travel and client entertainment costs 
we have a policy that seeks to limit travel and promotion expense attributable to each brokerage desk to an amount consistent with the revenue productivity of that brokerage desk 
this is accomplished by deducting any excess travel and promotion expense from the calculation of bonus compensation for many of our desks 
rent and occupancy our rent and occupancy expenses include the costs of leasing  furnishing and maintaining our offices in the north america  europe and the asia pacific region  including maintaining our technology infrastructure in these offices 
during  we substantially completed the move of our uk personnel to the new london office space  assumed starsupply s north american leases  executed a lease for our premises in paris and expanded our operations in tokyo 
our rent and occupancy expense increased in as a result of these new leases 
we incurred million in duplicate rent and related charges on the new london office space  which we began occupying in the fourth quarter of as we expand our business within existing locations or to new locations  our rent and occupancy expenses will likely increase 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expense arises from the depreciation and amortization of property  equipment and leasehold improvements  including software internally developed for our trading systems and related support software products  the amortization of software inventory developed in connection with analytics products to be marketed to third parties and the amortization of acquired intangible assets with definite lives 
over the past few years  we have incurred significant costs in the development of software for internal use as well as for software to be marketed externally 
as a result  depreciation and amortization expense has increased over this period 
software developed for internal use is depreciated once the software is ready for its intended use 
software inventory developed for external sales is amortized once the product is available for general release to clients 
we expect that depreciation and amortization expense will continue to increase because we continue to incur significant costs in the development of software for internal use as well as software to be marketed externally 
additionally  we expect that depreciation and amortization expense will increase in connection with purchases of property and equipment and leasehold improvements resulting from the additional leases we entered into during the year 
professional fees our professional fees include fees paid to consultants and other professionals who are engaged to support our strategic development of new and existing businesses and technologies 
our accounting and legal fees are also included in these costs 
as a public company  we are subject to various reporting and corporate governance requirements  including the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and the sec rules and regulations implementing that act  as well as recent changes to the nasdaq national market rules 
we expect our professional fees will increase due to our continuous effort to comply with these requirements 
clearing fees our clearing fees expense relates to expenses for clearing and settlement services and other transaction expenses that support principal transactions 
these amounts also include fees we pay to exchanges and floor brokers in connection with brokering various equity products 
clearing fees expense generally fluctuates based on transaction volumes and has increased in recent years due to an increase in the volume of principal transactions that we executed 
we expect our clearing fees will increase in the future due to the new desks that commenced operations in that largely provide services in the form of principal transactions 
interest expense our interest expense consists of interest charged by lenders to us in connection with our loans and lines of credit provided by our credit agreement and by our third party clearing organizations 
our credit obligations bear variable rates of interest 
as a result  our interest expense is subject to change based on the prevailing interest rate environment and the amount of variable rate debt we have outstanding 
other expenses our other expenses primarily relate to the changes in the fair value of the fenics purchase obligation see liquidity and capital resources and note to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail on the fenics purchase obligation  irrecoverable value added tax vat incurred in connection with our brokerage and data and analytics operations in the uk  litigation reserves  general office expenses and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
in addition  in  other expenses included a payment in connection with newly hired brokerage personnel in singapore to buy out their employment contracts 
irrecoverable vat represents the portion of vat we pay in connection with purchases of services and products in europe which cannot be claimed as a credit on our vat return 
irrecoverable vat amounts are determined based on a computed vat recovery rate 
lease termination costs to affiliate lease termination costs represent the various charges incurred in connection with the termination of the lease for our former primary office in the u 
k  which we leased from an affiliate 
see below and note to our consolidated financial statements for further details 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes consists of current and deferred tax provisions relating to federal  state and local taxes  as well as applicable taxes related to foreign subsidiaries 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined state and local income tax returns 
the difference between the statutory income tax rate and our effective tax rate for a given period is primarily a reflection of the tax effects of our foreign operations  general business credits and the non deductibility of certain expenses

revenues increased in each of our product categories with most of the increase in our credit product category 
the increase in credit product brokerage revenues of million was due to a number of factors including robust trading activity in the credit markets due to specific credit events including auto and auto supplies sector credit downgrades and bankruptcies  continued overall growth in the credit derivatives market  the development of new credit products  and the investment in and sectorization of both credit derivatives and corporate bonds 
our existing credit product desks contributed million of the total increase in credit product brokerage revenues 
the remaining million increase was generated by the addition of fifteen new or restructured credit product desks since december  a restructured brokerage desk generally refers to a brokerage desk that has been created out of a part of an existing desk in order to allow the brokers on that restructured desk to focus on one or more specific financial instrument or market sector for which the existing brokerage desk had previously provided brokerage services 
our investment in and development of credit products was highlighted by a credit product brokerage personnel increase of to employees at december  from employees at december  the increase in financial product brokerage revenues of million was primarily attributable to the combination of increased revenues from brokerage desks covering emerging markets  interest rate derivatives and exotic foreign exchange options in both the us and us due to volatility resulting from us interest rate movement  uncertainty in the direction of the us economy and inflationary fears due to high energy costs  and investment in our foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives business  particularly in asia

other income for the year ended december  mainly consisted of transactional net gains losses based on foreign currency fluctuations  net gains losses on foreign exchange derivative contracts and proceeds received by us from a litigation settlement related to an employment contract dispute with one of our competitors 
expenses compensation and employee benefits compensation and employee benefits expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of brokerage personnel from at december  to at december   an increase in performance related brokerage bonuses of million and an increase in expense related to sign on bonuses of million resulting in large part from our overall higher total brokerage revenues and the increase in brokerage personnel 
total compensation and employee benefits as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly to at december  from at december  total compensation and employee benefits as a percentage of total revenues  excluding the effect of new share based compensation arrangements in which deferred certain compensation costs  would have been for the year ended december  although we expect to continue to use share based compensation arrangements  we expect the decrease we experienced in total compensation and employee benefits as a percentage of total revenues in to diminish over the next several years

critical accounting policies and estimates general this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenue and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believed are reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we provide brokerage services to our clients in the form of either agency or principal transactions 
in agency transactions  we charge commissions for executing transactions between buyers and sellers 
we earn revenue from principal transactions on the spread between the buy and sell price of the security that is brokered 
our principal transaction revenue is primarily derived from matched principal transactions 
in matched principal transactions  we simultaneously agree to buy instruments from one party and sell them to another 
certain of our brokerage desks enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business  primarily for the purpose of facilitating our clients execution needs 
these unmatched positions are intended to be held short term 
brokerage revenues and related expenses from agency and principal transactions are recognized on a trade date basis 
we do not receive actual payment of the commissions or the net spread until the specific account receivable is collected in an agency transaction or until the specific settlement date in a principal transaction 
we evaluate the level of our allowance for doubtful accounts based on the financial condition of our clients  the length of time receivables are past due and our historical experience with the particular client 
also  if we know of a client s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific provision for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of that client to make payments 
the amount of the provision will be charged against the amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
if the financial condition of one of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  an additional provision could be required 
due to changing economic business and market conditions  we review the provision monthly and make changes to the provision as appropriate 
our allowance for doubtful accounts at december  was million 
software development capitalization software inventory we capitalize costs related to the development of certain software products or the costs related to the significant enhancement of existing products that meet the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
provides for the capitalization of computer software that is to be used as an integral part of a product or process to be sold or leased  after technological feasibility has been established for the software and all research and development activities for the other components of the product or process have been completed 
we cease capitalizing costs when the product is available for general release to our customers 
software inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  which is based on projected revenues 
we amortize the costs based on the greater of the ratio of current year revenue to current year revenue plus projected revenue or straight line  generally over three years 
amortization begins when a product is available for general release to customers 
the capitalized costs  the estimate of a product s economic life and the estimate of projected revenues require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions  market conditions or other circumstances could result in an impairment of the capitalized asset and a charge to our operating results 
internal use software we capitalize certain costs of software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with the statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of corporate software developed or obtained for internal use 
we capitalize software development costs when application development begins and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended 
costs associated with preliminary project stage activities  maintenance and all other post implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred 
our policy provides for the capitalization of certain payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects  as well as external direct costs of materials and services associated with developing or obtaining internal use software 
capitalized personnel costs are limited to time directly spent on such projects 
capitalized costs are ratably amortized  using the straight line method  over the estimated useful lives which are typically over three years 
our judgment as to which costs to capitalize  when to begin capitalizing such costs and what period to amortize the costs over  may materially affect our results of operations 
if management determines that the fair value of the software is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying value 
goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  management is required to perform a detailed review  at least annually  of the carrying value of our intangible assets  which includes goodwill 
in this process  management is required to make estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities and projected future earnings using various valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model 
management uses its best judgment and information available to it at the time to perform this review 
because management s assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future earnings as part of the valuation  actual results may differ 
if management determines that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the difference between the fair value and the carrying value 
contingencies in the normal course of business  we have been named as defendants in various lawsuits and proceedings and have been involved in certain regulatory examinations 
additional actions  investigations or proceedings may be brought from time to time in the future 
we are subject to the possibility of losses from these various contingencies 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies 
an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we accrue a liability for the estimated costs of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 
we have recorded reserves for certain contingencies to which we may have exposure  such as reserves for certain income tax and litigation contingencies and contingencies related to the employer portion of national insurance contributions in the uk we disclose asserted claims when it is at least reasonably possible that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and unasserted claims when it is considered probable that a claim will be asserted and there is a reasonable possibility that the outcome will be unfavorable 
it is not presently possible to determine our ultimate exposure to these matters and there is no assurance that the resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves we have accrued 
it is management s opinion that the ultimate resolution of these matters  while not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  could be material to our operating results for any particular period 
income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we provide for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards that result from events that have been recognized either in the financial statements or the income tax returns  but not both 
the measurement of current and deferred income tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of enacted tax laws 
valuation allowances are recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our interpretation of complex tax law may impact our measurement of current and deferred income taxes 
we are subject to regular examinations by the internal revenue service  taxing authorities in foreign countries  and states in which we have significant business operations 
we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each taxing jurisdiction resulting from on going and subsequent years examinations 
included in our current tax expense are charges to accruals for expected tax assessments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the resolution of these tax matters could have a material impact on our effective tax rate

in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred 
this interpretation also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of fin will not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations or financial position

our uk operations generate a majority of their revenues in us dollars and euros but pay a significant amount of their expenses in british pounds 
we enter into foreign exchange forward and foreign exchange collar contracts foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
certain of these foreign exchange derivative contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
the gain or loss on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is included in other comprehensive income in the period that changes in fair value occur and is reclassified to income in the same period that the hedged item affects income 
at december   we had outstanding foreign exchange derivative contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency with notional amounts translated into us dollars of million 
we would have received million at december  to settle these contracts  which represents the fair value 
at december   if the euro strengthened by against the us dollar  it would decrease the fair value of these contracts and  as a result  accumulated other comprehensive income would decrease by approximately million  net of tax 
we are also exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance of foreign exchange derivative contracts and in the event of nonperformance  to market risk for changes in currency rates 
the counterparties with whom we trade foreign exchange derivative contracts are major international financial institutions 
we monitor our positions with and the credit quality of these financial institutions and we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 
while our international results of operations  as measured in us dollars  are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations  we do not consider the related risk to be material to our results of operations 
if the euro strengthened by against the us dollar and the us dollar strengthened by against the british pound  the net impact to our net income would have been a reduction of approximately million as of december  interest rate risk we had million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  these debt obligations are subject to fluctuations in interest rates  which impact the amount of interest we must pay 
if variable interest rates were to increase by per annum  the annual impact to our net income would be a reduction of approximately million 
credit risk credit risk arises from potential non performance by counter parties and customers 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to credit risk 
we maintain a thorough credit approval process to limit exposure to counterparty risk and employ stringent monitoring to control the market and counterparty risk from our matched principal and agency businesses 
our brokers may only execute transactions for clients that have been approved by our credit committee following review by our credit department 
our credit approval process generally includes verification of key financial information and operating data and anti money laundering verification checks 
our credit review process includes consideration of independent credit agency reports and a visit to the entity s premises  if necessary 
we have developed and utilize a proprietary  electronic credit monitoring system 
credit approval is granted by our credit committee  which is comprised of senior management and representatives from our compliance  finance and legal departments 
credit approval is granted subject to certain trading limits and may be subject to additional conditions  such as the receipt of collateral or other credit support 
counterparties are reviewed for continued credit approval on at least an annual basis  and the results are provided to the credit committee 
maintenance procedures include reviewing current audited financial statements and publicly available information on the client  collecting data from credit rating agencies where available and reviewing any changes in ownership  title or capital of the client 
in the last five years  we have had no material losses due to the nonpayment of commissions receivable 
principal transactions through our subsidiaries  we execute matched principal transactions in which we act as a middleman by serving as counterparty to both a buyer and a seller in matching back to back trades 
these transactions are then settled through a third party clearing organization 
settlement typically occurs within one to three business days after the trade date 
cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded 
in a limited number of circumstances  we may settle a principal transaction by physical delivery of the underlying instrument 
our matched principal trades have continued to grow as compared to the prior years 
matched principal trades in the less liquid markets on which we focus are less likely to settle on a timely basis than transactions in more liquid markets 
receivables from brokers  dealers and clearing organizations and payables to brokers  dealers and clearing organizations on our consolidated statement of financial condition primarily represent the simultaneous purchase and sale of the securities associated with those matched principal transactions that have not settled as of their stated settlement dates 
our experience has been that substantially all of these transactions ultimately settle 
matched principal transactions expose us to risks 
in executing matched principal transactions  we are exposed to the risk that one of the counterparties to a transaction may fail to fulfill its obligations  either because it is not matched immediately or  even if matched  one party fails to deliver the cash or securities it is obligated to deliver 
our focus on less liquid and over the counter markets exacerbates this risk for us because transactions in these markets are less likely to settle on a timely basis 
adverse movements in the prices of securities that are the subject of these transactions can increase our risk 
in addition  widespread technological or communication failures  such as those which occurred as a result of the terrorist attacks on september  and the blackout in the eastern portion of the united states in august  as well as actual or perceived credit difficulties or the insolvency of one or more large or visible market participants  could cause market wide credit difficulties or other market disruptions 
these failures  difficulties or disruptions could result in a large number of market participants not settling transactions or otherwise not performing their obligations 
we are subject to financing risk in these circumstances because if a transaction does not settle on a timely basis  the resulting unmatched position may need to be financed  either directly by us or through one of our clearing organizations at our expense 
these charges may be recoverable from the failing counterparty  but sometimes are not 
finally  in instances where the unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged or widespread due to rapid or widespread declines in liquidity for an instrument  there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us  which depending on their size and duration  could limit our business flexibility or even force the curtailment of those portions of our business requiring higher levels of capital 
credit or settlement losses of this nature could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
in the process of executing matched principal transactions  miscommunications and other errors by our clients or us can arise whereby a transaction is not completed with one or more counterparties to the transaction  leaving us with either a long or short unmatched position 
these unmatched positions are referred to as out trades  and they create a potential liability for us 
if an out trade is promptly discovered and there is a prompt disposition of the unmatched position  the risk to us is usually limited 
if the discovery of an out trade is delayed  the risk is heightened by the increased possibility of intervening market movements prior to disposition 
although out trades usually become known at the time of  or later on the day of  the trade  it is possible that they may not be discovered until later in the settlement process 
when out trades are discovered  our policy is to have the unmatched position disposed of promptly  whether or not this disposition would result in a loss to us 
the occurrence of out trades generally rises with increases in the volatility of the market and  depending on their number and amount  such out trades have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
transactions done on an agency basis may also give rise to such risks 
in addition  liability for unmatched trades could adversely affect our results of operations and balance sheet 
we allow certain of our brokerage desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business  primarily for the purpose of facilitating clients execution needs or for the purpose of proprietary trading to arbitrage the value between an exchange traded fund and its component securities 
as a result  we have market risk exposure on these unmatched principal transactions 
our exposure varies based on the size of the overall positions  the terms of the instruments brokered  and the amount of time the positions are held before we dispose of the position 
we do not track our exposure to unmatched positions on an intra day basis  however  we attempt to mitigate our market risk on these positions by hedging our exposure 
these unmatched positions are intended to be held short term 

however  due to a number of factors  including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades  we may not be able to match the position or effectively hedge our exposure and we may be forced to hold a position overnight that has not been hedged 
to the extent these unmatched positions are not disposed of intra day  we mark these positions to market 
we attempt to manage our market risk exposure from any proprietary trading activities through the establishment and monitoring of trading policies  which include limiting those brokerage desks that are authorized to enter into unmatched positions  limiting types of transactions that may be executed on an unmatched basis and by setting position and capital at risk limits 
adverse movements in the securities underlying these positions or a downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a substantial loss 
in addition  principal gains and losses resulting from these positions could on occasion have a disproportionate effect  positive or negative  on our financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period 
we also attempt to mitigate the risks associated with principal transactions through our credit approval and credit monitoring processes 
we maintain a credit approval process as described above under the discussion of credit risk as a means of mitigating exposure to counterparty risk 
in addition  our credit risk department regularly monitors concentration of market risk to financial instruments  countries or counterparties and regularly monitors trades that have not settled within prescribed settlement periods or volume thresholds 
we have developed and utilize a proprietary  electronic credit monitoring system  which provides management with twice daily credit reports that analyze credit concentration
