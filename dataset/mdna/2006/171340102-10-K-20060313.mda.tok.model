item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview the company develops  manufactures and markets a broad range of consumer and specialty products 
it recognizes revenues and profits from selling its products under a variety of brands  including arm hammer and trojan  to consumers through supermarkets  drug stores and mass merchandisers  and to industrial customers and distributors 
on may   the company acquired the joint venture interest in armkel owned by affiliates of kelso company  and armkel was merged into the company 
this is sometimes referred as the armkel acquisition 
the discussion of results of operations of armkel are reflected in the results of operations since the acquisition on may  the company operates in three primary segments  consumer domestic  consumer international and specialty products 
our consumer domestic segment includes household products for deodorizing such as arm hammer baking soda and cat litter products  laundry and cleaning  such as xtra and arm hammer laundry detergents  scrub free and brillo cleaning products  and personal care products  such as trojan condoms  nair depilatories and waxes  first response and answer home pregnancy and ovulation test kits  arrid antiperspirant and arm hammer  mentadent  close up  pepsodent and aim toothpastes 
our consumer international segment sells a variety of personal care products  some of which use the same brands as our domestic product lines  in international markets  including france  the united kingdom  canada  mexico  australia  brazil and spain 
our specialty products spd segment is the largest us producer of sodium bicarbonate  which it sells together with other specialty inorganic chemicals for a variety of industrial  institutional  medical and food applications 
this segment also sells a range of animal nutrition and specialty cleaning products 
for the twelve months ended december   our consumer domestic  consumer international and specialty products segments represented approximately  and  respectively  of net sales 
for the three year period ended december   the company s earnings per share has grown at an average rate of  its sales has increased from  million in to  million in and its income from operations has increased from million in to million in these increases principally reflect the armkel and unilever oral care business acquisitions 
during  the company continued to experience extraordinary price increases for raw and packaging materials  diesel fuel and energy costs  partially as a result of strong demand from china and supply interruptions caused by hurricanes katrina and rita 
the hurricanes devastating damage to oil and chemical production facilities in the gulf region resulted in widespread shortages 
while the company was able to identify alternative supply sources at much higher costs  and maintain normal service levels  it was able to partially offset these higher costs through cost improvement programs and pricing actions taken over the last twelve months 
the company expects these increases to have some residual impact on its operations during the first half of the company operates in highly competitive consumer product markets  in which cost efficiency  new product offerings and innovation are critical to success 
the consumer products markets are particularly mature in north america and are characterized by high household penetration  particularly with respect to the company s most significant product categories such as laundry detergents and oral care 
furthermore  because of ongoing retail sector consolidation and the competitive environment facing retailers  the company faces pricing pressure from these customers  particularly the high volume retail store customers  who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms 
to protect its existing market share or to capture increased market share  the company had to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and to introduce and establish new products 
consequently  the need for ongoing cost cutting initiatives needs to be sustained as new product introductions or product line extensions remain the most viable path to generating organic top line growth given the mature nature of most product categories in north american markets 
through its acquisitions  the company has been able to lower its overall unit costs and increase the productivity of its various manufacturing facilities 
this has resulted in higher levels of cash flow 

table of contents recent acquisitions on october   the company closed on its previously announced acquisition of the spinbrush toothbrush business from the procter gamble company p g 
the company paid million in cash at closing 
the company will purchase the inventory following a transition period which is expected to be completed by mid and may make additional cash payments of up to million based on the near term performance of the business 
the acquisition was funded out of the company s available cash 
an independent appraisal of the assets acquired is in process 
the financial statements included in this report reflect a preliminary allocation  which assigns a significant amount of the purchase price to intangible assets 
during the transition period  while p g continues to provide significant services  the company is accounting for the net cash received from p g as other revenue 
the company expects to complete the transition process by mid during the fourth quarter of  the company acquired a small skin care business in south america 
the company paid approximately million  which was allocated to intangible assets 
the results since the acquisition are included in the consumer international segment 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses matters set forth in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and promotional and sales returns reserves most of the company s revenue represents sales of finished goods inventory and is recognized when delivered to or picked up by our customer 
the reserves for consumer and trade promotion liabilities and sales returns are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
promotional reserves are provided for sales incentives made directly to consumers such as coupons and sales incentives made to vendors such as slotting  cooperative advertising  incentive discounts based on volume of sales and other arrangements 
all such costs are netted against sales 
slotting costs are recorded when the related sale is recognized 
co op advertising costs are recorded when the customer places the advertisement for the company s products 
discounts relating to price reduction arrangements are recorded when the related sale takes place 
costs associated with end aisle or other in store displays are recorded when product is sold relating to the promotion 
the company relies on historical experience and forecasted data to determine the required reserves 
for example  the company uses historical experience to project coupon redemption rates to determine reserve requirements 
based on the total face value of coupons redeemed over the past couple of years  if the actual rate of redemptions were to deviate by from the rate accrued for in the financial statements  an approximately million difference in the reserve required would result 
with regard to other promotional reserves and sales returns  the company uses experience based estimates  customer and sales organization inputs  and historical trend analysis in arriving at the reserves required 
if the company s estimates for vendor promotional activities and sales returns were to differ by the impact to promotional spending and sales return accruals would be approximately million 
while management believes that its promotional and sales returns reserves are reasonable and that appropriate judgements have been made  estimated amounts could differ materially from actual future obligations 
during the twelve months ended december   the company reversed promotion liabilities of approximately million based on changes to previous estimates  and in and the company reversed promotion liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 

table of contents impairment of goodwill  trademarks and other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment carrying values of goodwill  trademarks and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company s impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant judgment with respect to volume  revenue and expense growth rates  and the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
management uses estimates based on expected trends in making these assumptions 
with respect to goodwill  impairment occurs when the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the discounted present value of cash flows for that reporting unit 
for trademarks and other intangible assets  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated cash flows  which represents the estimated fair value of the asset 
the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual valuations 
indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities and acts by governments and courts may indicate that an asset has become impaired 
property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets are reviewed periodically for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company s impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
the analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology  the continued success of product lines  and future volume  revenue and expense growth rates 
the company conducts annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment  and reviews business plans for possible impairment implications 
impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows 
when an impairment is indicated  the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
in  the company recognized tradename impairment  plant impairment and restructuring and equipment obsolescence charges of approximately million  of which million  million and million were included in the operating results of the consumer domestic  consumer international and spd segments  respectively 
in  the company recognized tradename  equipment obsolescence and plant impairment charges of million  which were charged to the consumer domestic segment 
in  the company recognized tradename  equipment obsolescence and plant impairment charges of approximately million  which were charged to the consumer domestic segment 
the estimates and assumptions used in connection with impairment analyses are consistent with the business plans and estimates that the company uses to manage its business operations 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated value of future cash flows and would have increased or decreased any impairment charge taken 
future outcomes may also differ 
if the company s products fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets  market conditions unfavorably change or other significant estimates are not realized  then the company s revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and the company may be required to recognize additional impairment charges 
inventory valuation when appropriate  the company writes down the carrying value of its inventory to the lower of cost or market net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the company identifies any slow moving  obsolete or excess inventory to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates and assumptions about the future demand for the company s products  technological changes  and new product introductions 
in addition  the company s allowance for obsolescence may be impacted by the reduction of the number of stock keeping units sku s 
the number of domestic sku s has been reduced by approximately over the last years 
to minimize this risk  the company evaluates its inventory levels and expected usage on a periodic basis and records adjustments as required 
adjustments to the inventory s net realizable value were million at december   and million at december  
table of contents valuation of pension and postretirement benefit costs the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to our actuaries  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
material changes in the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
the discount rate is subject to change each year  consistent with changes in applicable high quality  long term corporate bond indices 
based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans and postretirement plans we refer to applicable indices such as standard poors or the moody s aa corporate bond index to select a rate at which we believe the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
based on the published rates as of december   as well as selected corporate bonds matching our estimated cash flows of the plans  the company used a discount rate of for its three domestic plans 
the discount rate used in is the same as the december  rate used for the domestic plans 
the company s weighted average discount rate as of december   is as compared to used at december  all foreign subsidiaries lowered their discount rate at december  the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is selected by taking into account a historical trend  the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans  the asset mix of the plans  and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation 
based on these factors  the company s weighted average expected long term rate of return as of december  is  a decline of basis points from the rate used at december  this decrease is due to the change in the expected long term rate of the company s domestic plans from to 
a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return would result in less than a million change in pension expense for in accordance with sfas no 
 the company recognized an additional minimum pension liability of million in  and recorded a charge  net of tax  to accumulated other comprehensive loss of million which decreased stockholders equity 
the charge to stockholders equity for the excess of additional pension liability represents a net loss not yet recognized as pension expense 
the company made cash contributions of approximately million to certain of its pension plans in the company estimates it will be required to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately million in tax contingencies the company records liabilities in income taxes payable for potential assessments in various tax jurisdictions 
the liabilities relate to tax return positions which  although supportable by the company  may be challenged by the tax authorities 
the company adjusts these liabilities as a result of changes in tax legislation  interpretations of laws by courts  rulings by tax authorities  changes in estimates and the closing of the statute of limitations 
the company s tax rate includes the impact of the liabilities and any changes to the liabilities 
settlement of any issue with the tax authorities would require the use of cash 
favorable resolution of an issue would be recognized as a reduction to the company s annual tax rate

competitive environment many of our competitors are large companies  including the procter gamble company  unilever  inc  the clorox company  colgate palmolive company  sc johnson son  inc  henkel  reckett benckiser  pfizer  inverness and ssl international  many of which have greater financial resources than the company 
these companies have the capacity to outspend the company if they attempt to gain market share 
because of the competitive environment facing retailers  the company faces pricing pressure from these customers  particularly the high volume retail store customers  who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms 
these concessions or terms could reduce the company s margins 
furthermore  if the company is unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to its trade customers  the customers could increase product purchases from our competitors  which would harm the company s sales and profitability 
consumer products  particularly those that are value priced  such as laundry and household cleaning products are subject to significant price competition 
from time to time  the company may need to reduce the prices for some of its products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share 
the company competes in the oral care and personal care and deodorizing businesses using the unique strengths of its arm hammer trademark and baking soda technology 
these are highly innovative markets  characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions  and requiring heavy advertising and promotion 
in the toothpaste category  after leading its category in growth several years ago  driven by the success of arm hammer advance white toothpaste  the company s share dropped in mainly as a result of competitive new products and aggressive spending by other manufacturers in the category 
however in  share increased modestly based upon the introduction of arm hammer enamel care 
shares in declined slightly 
early in  the company launched arm hammer enamel care toothpaste  its most important oral care innovation in several years 
enamel care is based on proprietary formulation and packaging 
table of contents technology which combines the cleaning and whitening properties of baking soda with fluoride and patented liquid calcium in a dual chamber tube to fill tooth surfaces and restore enamel luster 
the product is available in two variants advanced cleaning and natural whitening 
in  the company introduced arm hammer enamel care with breath defense  which combines liquid calcium technology with additional long lasting breath benefits 
in addition  the entire arm hammer toothpaste line has been re staged with new packaging graphics designed to return the brand to its original emphasis on therapeutic benefits 
in  the company will introduce an improved version of arm hammer enamel care toothpaste with liquid calcium to strengthen tooth enamel 
in  the company launched mentadent replenishing white toothpaste with liquid calcium technology to strengthen tooth enamel and prevent stains from forming 
other important personal care initiatives  included additions to the arm hammer ultramax antiperspirant line in in  the entire arrid antiperspirant line was restaged with improved formulas  fragrances and packaging 
this restage helped to reduce the rate of share decline during the second half of the domestic condom market is highly concentrated in product offerings with a limited number of competitors
