item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes included in the consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f of this report 
overview industry background our continuing operations are comprised of one reportable operating segment pulp and papermaking systems papermaking systems  and two product lines  fiber based products and casting products 
through our pulp and papermaking systems segment  we develop  manufacture  and market a range of equipment and products for the domestic and international papermaking and paper recycling industries 
we have a large  stable customer base that includes most of the world s major paper manufacturers 
as a result  we have one of the largest installed bases of equipment in the pulp and paper industry 
our installed base provides us with a spare parts and consumables business that yields higher margins than our capital equipment business  and which  we believe  is less susceptible to the cyclical trends in the paper industry 
through our fiber based products line  we manufacture and sell granules derived from pulp fiber for use as carriers for agricultural  home lawn and garden  and professional lawn  turf and ornamental applications  as well as for oil and grease absorption 
we also manufacture and sell grey and ductile iron castings through our casting products business 
prior to the sale of the composites business  we produced composite building products  including decking and railing systems and roof tiles  made from recycled fiber  plastic  and other material  which were marketed through distributors primarily to the building industry 
on october   our kadant composites llc subsidiary kadant composites llc sold substantially all of its assets  comprising the composites business  to ldi composites co 
the buyer for approximately million in cash and the assumption of million of liabilities resulting in an immaterial gain on sale 
the sale price is subject to a post closing adjustment 
as part of the sale transaction  kadant composites llc retained the warranty obligations associated with products manufactured prior to the sale date 
kadant composites llc deposited million of the sale proceeds into a special escrow fund to satisfy these warranty claims 
this fund will be administered by the buyer for five years or until the funds are exhausted  after which time kadant composites llc will administer any remaining covered warranty claims 
based on the claims submitted to the buyer for reimbursement through year end  the remaining balance in the special escrow fund would be reduced to approximately million 
based on the claims activity and payments processed after year end  we anticipate that the special escrow fund will be utilized and kadant composites llc will assume claims processing in as of december   the accrued warranty reserve associated with the composites business was million 
all future activity associated with this warranty reserve will continue to be classified in the results of the discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
international sales during  approximately of our sales were to customers outside the united states  principally in europe and asia 
we generally seek to charge our customers in the same currency in which our operating costs are incurred 
however  our financial performance and competitive position can be affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting the relationship between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of forward currency exchange contracts 
we may enter into forward contracts to hedge certain firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
these contracts hedge transactions principally denominated in us dollars 

table of contents kadant inc annual report application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we enter into arrangements with customers that have multiple deliverables  such as equipment and installation  and we recognize revenues and profits on certain long term contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
percentage of completion 
revenues recorded under the percentage of completion method of accounting were million in  million in  and million in the percentage of completion is determined by comparing the actual costs incurred to date to an estimate of total costs to be incurred on each contract 
if a loss is indicated on any contract in process  a provision is made currently for the entire loss 
our contracts generally provide for billing of customers upon the attainment of certain milestones specified in each contract 
revenues earned on contracts in process in excess of billings are classified as unbilled contract costs and fees  and amounts billed in excess of revenues are classified as billings in excess of contract costs and fees 
the complexity of the estimation process under the percentage of completion method affects the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our percentage of completion and cost of sales estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  estimates of warranty costs  estimated future material prices from vendors  and customer specification and testing requirements 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk  primarily relating to our orders in china  that a customer will not comply with the order s contractual obligations to take delivery of the equipment 
this risk is reduced somewhat by such customer s forfeiture of their deposit on the order 
the contractual obligations relating to the order may be difficult to enforce through a foreign country s legal system  which could result in a significant credit exposure in the period or periods that were to be affected by the breach of contract 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates in the application of this accounting policy  if our business conditions were to be different  or if we were to use different assumptions  it is possible that materially different amounts could be reported as revenues in our consolidated financial statements 
sab no 
under staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  when the terms of sale include customer acceptance provisions  and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated until customer acceptance  revenues are recognized upon such acceptance 
when a sale arrangement involves multiple elements eg  installation  we consider the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
such transactions are evaluated to determine whether the deliverables in the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
if equipment and installation do not meet the separation criteria under eitf no 
 revenues for products sold that require installation  for which the installation is essential to functionality or is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  are recognized upon completion of installation 
revenues for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality  and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  are recognized upon shipment  with estimated installation costs accrued 
we provide a reserve for the estimated warranty and installation costs at the time revenue is 
table of contents kadant inc annual report recognized  as applicable 
to the extent that installation becomes a significant component of our business in the future  the judgment associated with the determination of revenue recognition will increase 
the complexity of all issues related to the assumptions  risks  and uncertainties inherent in the application of sab no 
affects the amounts reported as revenues in our consolidated financial statements 
under sab no 
 we may not be able to reliably predict future revenues and profitability due to the difficulty of estimating when installation will be performed or when we will meet the contractually agreed upon performance tests  which can delay or prohibit recognition of revenues 
the determination of when we install the equipment or fulfill the performance guarantees is largely dependent on our customers  their willingness to allow installation of the equipment or performance of the appropriate tests in a timely manner  and their cooperation in addressing possible problems that would impede achievement of the performance guarantee criteria 
unexpected changes in the timing related to the completion of installation or performance guarantees could cause our revenues and earnings to be significantly affected 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost on a first in  first out  last in  first out  or weighted average basis or market value and include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare these amounts to historical and forecasted usage of and demand for each particular product or product line 
we record a charge to cost of revenues for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of the inventories to net realizable value 
inventory writedowns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand  resulting in a charge for the writedown of that inventory in that period 
in addition  our estimates of future product usage or demand may prove to be inaccurate  resulting in an understated or overstated provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product usage and demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as a decline in sales  earnings  or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
we completed our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of using estimates from our long range forecasts 
intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets based on the analysis performed 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology specifically  the income approach 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on our long range forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts are our best estimates based on current and anticipated market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected based on current and anticipated cost structures 
our judgments and assumptions regarding the determination of the fair value of an intangible asset or goodwill associated with an acquired business could change as future events impact such fair values 
any future impairment loss could have a material adverse affect on our long term assets and operating expenses in the period in which impairment is determined to exist 
accounts receivable 
we exercise judgment in determining our allowance for bad debts  which is based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policies  specific customer collection issues  and accounts receivable aging categories 
in determining this allowance  we look at historical writeoffs of our receivables 
we also look at current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in our credit policies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and each customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
in addition  in some instances we utilize letters of credit as a way to mitigate 
table of contents kadant inc annual report credit exposure 
while actual bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of bad debts that we have in the past  especially in light of business conditions in the paper industry 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers could result in the uncollectibility of the related accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating cash flows in that period 
warranties 
in the papermaking systems segment  we offer warranties of various durations to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
we typically negotiate terms regarding warranty coverage and length of warranty depending on the products and their applications 
our standard mechanical warranties require us to repair or replace a defective product during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs  as well as other analytical tools for estimating future warranty claims 
these estimates are revised for variances between actual and expected claims rates 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
on october   kadant composites llc sold its composites business  presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as part of the transaction  kadant composites llc retained the warranty obligation associated with products manufactured prior to the sale date 
our consolidated results will continue to be impacted by any adjustments to this warranty obligation  which will continue to be presented within the discontinued operation 
this warranty obligation relates to a standard limited warranty provided to the original owner of our decking and roofing products  limited to repair or replacement of the defective product or a refund of the original purchase price 
prior to the sale of the composites business  we recorded an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs  as well as other analytical tools for estimating future warranty claims 
these estimates are revised for variances between actual and expected claims rates 
our analysis of expected warranty claims rates includes detailed assumptions associated with potential product returns  including the type of product sold  temperatures at the location of installation  density of boards  and other factors 
certain assumptions  such as the effect of weather conditions and high temperatures on the product installed  include inherent uncertainties that are subject to fluctuation which could impact our future warranty provisions 
due to the highly subjective nature of these assumptions  we have recorded our best estimate of the cost of expected warranty claims 
it is reasonably possible that the ultimate settlement of such claims may exceed the amount recorded  if we incur warranty return rates higher than we anticipated 
a significant increase in warranty return rates or costs to repair our products would lead to an increase in the warranty provision and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs occur 
income taxes 
we estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not the tax asset or loss carryforward will be used  we would reverse the related valuation allowance 
our tax valuation allowance totaled million at year end should our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from our estimate  additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 
we provide a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
should tax return positions that we expect are sustainable not be sustained upon audit  we could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes 
should previously unrecognized tax benefits be sustained  a reduction in our tax provision would result 
industry and business outlook our products are primarily sold to the pulp and paper industry 
the paper industry had been in a prolonged downcycle for the past several years 
while the performance of paper producers  especially in north america  
table of contents kadant inc annual report has been gradually improving over the past year  the industry is continuing to experience sluggish demand 
the profitability of paper producers is still being negatively affected by higher operating costs  especially higher energy costs 
we believe paper companies remain cautious about increasing their capital and operating spending in the current market environment 
we expect  however  if the market recovers  paper companies will increase their capital and operating spending  which would have a positive effect on paper company suppliers  such as kadant  although the timing of such effect is difficult to predict 
we continue to concentrate our efforts on several initiatives intended to improve our operating results  including i integrating the kadant johnson acquisition  ii penetrating new markets outside the paper industry  iii completing our acquisition of a stock preparation production plant in china  and iv increasing aftermarket sales 
in addition  we continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating costs  capital expenditures  and working capital 
in an effort to improve operating performance at our kadant lamort subsidiary in france  we approved a restructuring of that subsidiary in intended to strengthen kadant lamort s competitive position in the european paper industry 
we accrued a restructuring charge for severance and other termination costs in connection with the workforce reduction of million in the fourth quarter of we completed the the restructuring actions in and as a result of these actions  we estimate that our kadant lamort subsidiary will be profitable in we continue to pursue market opportunities outside north america 
in the last several years  china has become a significant market for our stock preparation equipment 
to capitalize on this growing market  we plan to acquire a manufacturing and assembly facility in china for this equipment and related products  as well as for certain of our accessories and water management products in the future 
revenues from china are primarily derived from large capital orders  the timing of which is often difficult to predict 
our customers in china have experienced delays in obtaining financing for their capital addition and expansion projects due to efforts by the chinese government to control economic growth  which are reflected in a slowdown in financing approvals in china s banking system 
this has caused delays in receiving orders and  as a result  will delay our recognizing revenue on these projects to periods later than originally anticipated 
we plan to use our new facility in china as a base for increasing our aftermarket business  which we believe will be more predictable 
our guidance reflects expected revenues and earnings per share from continuing operations  which excludes the results from our discontinued operation 
for the first quarter of  we expect to earn  from continuing operations  between

on october   the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act created a temporary incentive for us multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us at an effective tax rate of 
after evaluating the effect of the law on our unremitted foreign earnings  we have determined that due to various factors  there is no benefit to us 
therefore  it will remain our practice to reinvest indefinitely the earnings of our international subsidiaries  except in instances in which we can remit such earnings without a significant associated tax cost 
through december   we have not provided us income taxes on approximately million of unremitted foreign earnings 
we believe that any us tax liability due upon remittance of such earnings would be immaterial due to the availability of us foreign tax credits generated from such remittance 
the related foreign tax withholding  which would be required if we remitted the foreign earnings to the us  would be approximately million 
on january   on behalf of our wholly foreign owned enterprise formed in china  we entered into an asset purchase agreement with jining huayi light industry machinery co  ltd

b in addition to the consideration paid at closing for kadant johnson  we issued a letter of credit to the sellers for million related to certain tax assets of kadant johnson  the value of which we expect to realize 
this amount is subject to adjustment based on the johnson corporation s final tax return for the table above excludes contingent consideration of million associated with the kadant johnson acquisition 
the parties agreed in the purchase agreement to an earn out provision  based on the achievement of certain revenue targets between the closing date of may  and july   which could increase the purchase price by up to million 
based on our current forecasts  we do not believe that a significant payout under the earn out provision is likely 
c in the ordinary course of business  we are required to issue limited performance guarantees  which do not require letters of credit  relating to our equipment and systems 
we typically limit our liability under these guarantees to amounts that would not exceed the value of the contract 
we believe that we have adequate reserves for any potential liability in connection with such guarantees 
these guarantees are not included in this table 
d this table excludes million of accrued restructuring costs and million of other long term liabilities related primarily to pension plans  as these liabilities are not subject to fixed payment terms 
we expect that the accrued restructuring costs will be paid in provisions in financial guarantees or commitments  debt or lease agreements  or other arrangements could trigger a requirement for an early payment  additional collateral support  amended terms  or acceleration of maturity 
we do not have special purpose entities nor do we use off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in the future  our liquidity position will be primarily affected by the level of cash flows from operations and the amount of cash expended on debt repayments  capital projects  stock repurchases  or additional acquisitions  if any 
we believe that our existing resources  together with the cash available from our credit facility and the cash we expect to generate from continuing operations  are sufficient to meet the capital requirements of our current operations for the foreseeable future 

table of contents kadant inc annual report item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
we entered into a receive variable and pay fixed swap agreement in to hedge a portion of our variable rate long term debt 
additionally  we use short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to foreign currencies 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries local currencies 
we do not engage in extensive foreign currency hedging activities  however  the purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect our local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our forward foreign exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in us dollars 
gains and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to gains and losses resulting from the transactions being hedged 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates our cash and cash equivalents are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in interest income due to the difference between the current interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and the variable rates to which these financial instruments may adjust in the future 
a decrease in year end interest rates would have resulted in a negative impact on our net income of million in both and a portion of our outstanding debt of million as of year end is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we hedged million of the debt with a receive variable pay fixed swap agreement 
the fair value of the swap agreement is sensitive to changes in the year treasury bill rate 
a decrease in the year end year treasury bill rate would have resulted in an increase of unrealized losses of million as of year end the remaining unhedged portion of the debt totaling million as of year end is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as of year end  the interest rate on the unhedged portion of the debt was based on libor 
a increase in the year end libor rate would have resulted in a negative impact on our net income of million in currency exchange rates we generally view our investment in foreign subsidiaries in a functional currency other than our reporting currency as long term 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  mexican pesos  canadian dollars  chinese renminbi and brazilian reals 
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders investment 
a depreciation in functional currencies at year end and  relative to the us dollar  would have resulted in a reduction in shareholders investment of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is the estimated amount that we would pay or receive upon termination of the contracts  taking into account the change in foreign currency exchange rates 
a depreciation in year end and foreign currency exchange rates related to our contracts would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses on forward foreign exchange contracts of million in both and since we use forward foreign exchange contracts as hedges of firm purchase and sale commitments  the unrealized gain or loss on forward foreign currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged items
