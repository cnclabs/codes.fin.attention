item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this report 
introduction we are the largest provider of regulated medical waste services in north america 
in addition we offer osha compliance services to health care providers and other monitoring services 
during  we acquired white rose environmental ltd  which is a leading provider of regulated medical waste services in the united kingdom 
we derive our revenues from services to two principal types of customers i outpatient clinics  medical and dental offices  biomedical companies  pharmacies municipal entities  long term and sub acute care facilities and other smaller quantity generators of regulated medical waste small account customers and ii hospitals  blood banks  pharmaceutical manufacturers and other larger quantity generators of regulated medical waste large account customers 

table of contents substantially all of our services are provided pursuant to customer contracts specifying either scheduled or on call services  or both 
contracts with small account customers generally provide for annual price increases and have an automatic renewal provision unless the customer notifies us to the contrary prior to the expiration of the current term of the contract 
contracts with hospitals and other large account customers  which may run for more than one year  typically include price escalator provisions  which allow for price increases generally tied to an inflation index or set at a fixed percentage 
we also serve pharmacies  distributors and manufacturers of pharmaceutical products by managing the return and disposal of expired or surplus pharmaceutical products and by managing the recall of pharmaceutical products being recalled by the manufacturer 
in  we completed four acquisitions of companies that provide these services 
as of december   we served approximately  customers  of which approximately  were small account customers and approximately  were large account customers 
critical accounting policies and procedures our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note to our consolidated financial statements  the following ones may involve a higher degree of judgment on our part and greater complexity of reporting 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for our medical waste services at the time of medical waste collection 
revenue and costs on contracts to supply our proprietary etd treatment equipment are recognized based on shipment of equipment and services provided for in the individual contract 
we routinely review total estimated costs and shipments to complete each contract and revise the revenues and estimated gross margin on the contract as necessary 
payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided 
royalty revenues are calculated based on measurements specified in each contract or license and revenues are recognized at the end of each reporting period when the activity being measured has been completed 
revenues from product sales are recognized at the time the goods are shipped to the ordering customer 
software licensing revenues are recognized on a prorated basis over the term of the license agreement 
revenues from pharmaceutical services are recorded at the time services are performed 
we do not have any contracts in a loss position 
losses would be recorded when known and estimable for any contracts that should go into a loss position 
payments received in advance are deferred and recognized as services are provided 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill associated with the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is not amortized 
we have determined that our permits have indefinite lives and  accordingly are not amortized 
this position is in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards fas no 
 which became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our balance sheet at december  contains goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  of million 
in accordance with fas  we evaluate on at least an annual basis  using the fair value of reporting units  whether goodwill is impaired 
if we were to determine that a significant impairment has occurred  we would be required to incur non cash write offs of the impaired portion of goodwill that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the write off occurs 
we use the market value of our stock as the current measurement of total fair value of our reporting units and any unforeseen material drop in our stock price maybe an indicator of a potential impairment of goodwill 
the results of the impairment test conducted in june did not show any impairment of goodwill  and there have not occurred any events since that time that indicate that an impairment situation exists 

table of contents our permits are currently tested for impairment annually at december or more frequently if circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
we use a discounted cash flow model as the current measurement of the fair value of the permits 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management 
our estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  inaccuracies in economic estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect the future financial value of the permits 
the results of the impairment test did not show any impairment of our permits and no events have occurred since that time that would indicate an impairment situation exists 
other identifiable intangible assets  such as customer lists  tradenames and covenants not to compete  are currently amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we have determined that our medical waste business customer lists have year lives and our pharmaceutical services business customer lists have year lives 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be less than the undiscounted cash flows 
there have been no indicators of impairment of these intangibles see note to our consolidated financial statements 
during we were in arbitration proceedings regarding various disputes under an exclusive marketing and distribution license agreement with a licensor of software 
on march   subsequent to year end  the arbitrator awarded damages to the licensor and the license agreement was effectively terminated 
although this event occurred after the end of the year  we are required to write off the unamortized portion of the license fee that we had previously paid 
the effect is a reduction in the carrying amount of this intangible by million and a reduction in the accumulated amortization of million 
income taxes 
deferred income tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
accounts receivable balances are determined to be delinquent when the amount is past due based on the contractual terms with the customer 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified among uncollected accounts 
accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when we have determined that the receivable will not be collected and or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency 
no single customer accounts for more than of our revenues 
insurance 
our insurance for worker s compensation  vehicle liability and physical damage  and employee related health care benefits is obtained using high deductible insurance polices 
a third party administrator is used to process all such claims 
we require all workers compensation  vehicle liability and physical damage claims to be reported within hours 
as a result  we accrue our worker s compensation  vehicle and physical damage liability based upon the claim reserves established by the third party administrator at the end of each reporting period 
our employee health insurance benefit liability is based on our historical claims experience rate 
our earnings would be impacted to the extent that actual claims vary from historical experience 
we review our accruals associated with the exposure to these liabilities for adequacy at the end of each reporting period 
litigation 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and deal with regulatory inquiries or investigations from time to time that may be instituted for a variety of reasons 
we are also involved in a variety of civil litigation from time to time 
settlements from litigation would be recorded when known  probable and estimable 
stock option plans 
we have issued stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of our compensation programs 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states allow alternative methods of accounting for these plans 
we have chosen to account for our stock option plans under accounting principles board opinion no
