dsg a expense as a percent of sales was in compared to in during the labor dispute  the company achieved significant economies of scale from incremental sales 
dsg a expense as a percent of sales has increased since the conclusion of the labor dispute  however  the company has succeeded in retaining some of the economies of scale due to the sales retained compared to pre strike periods 
these economies were partially offset by approximately  of bonus expense recognized and paid in the first half of to the company s ufcw employees and higher compensation expense in related to the company s sars program

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management has established accounting policies that they believe are appropriate in order to reflect the accurate reporting of the company s operating results  financial position and cash flows 
the company applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner 
management bases their estimates on historical experience  current and expected economic conditions and various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company reevaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  and therefore actual results may differ from estimates 
management believes that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of the company s financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
investments investments are accounted for under the provisions of sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination at each balance sheet date 
debt securities for which the company does not have the intent or ability to hold to maturity and equity securities are classified as available for sale investments and any unrealized gains and losses are included as a separate component of stockholders equity

inventories supermarket nonperishable inventories are recorded using the retail method and are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
perishable inventories are valued at the lower of cost on a first in  first out fifo method or market 
inventory reserves are maintained for dry goods at historical run rates that are adjusted annually  and trued up at each physical count three times per year to ensure adequacy of the reserve 
inventories of perishable items are taken at the end of every month  and balances are adjusted accordingly and flowed through cost of sales 
impairment of long lived assets the company monitors the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is recognized when estimated future cash flows undiscounted and before interest charges are less than carrying value 
the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital 
if impairment analysis assumptions change  then an adjustment to the carrying value of the company s long lived assets could occur 
to the extent that an asset is impaired  the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged against earnings 
workers compensation and general and auto liability insurance the company is primarily self insured for losses related to workers compensation and general and auto liability claims 
the company purchases stop loss insurance coverage to limit its loss exposure on a per claim basis 
accruals are based on reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported

discounts given to customers are recorded at the point of sale as a reduction of revenues 
the company maintains a bad debt allowance for receivables from vendors and gelson s credit card sales

the company records income from licensing arrangements  subleases  leases and finance charges as they are earned 
merchandise costs cost of sales and inventory includes product costs  net of discounts and allowances  and inbound freight charges

with promotional allowances  vendors pay the company to promote their product 
the promotion may be a temporary price reduction  a feature in a print advertisement or newsletter  or placement of the vendor s product in a preferred location in a store 
the promotions are typically two to three weeks long and are recognized when the commitment has been fulfilled 
promotional and vendor rebate allowances are recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold except advertising reimbursements which are recorded as a reduction of advertising expense which is included in dsg a expense 
the company also receives other allowances which are recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold when they are earned 
occasionally  the company receives rebate allowances in the form of upfront lump sum payments from vendors 
under the terms of these long term agreements  the company earns the rebates as it purchases product from the vendor 
the upfront payments are recorded as a liability when they are received and are recorded as a reduction of inventory cost as the product is purchased 
in the event that the company does not purchase the minimum amount of product specified in the agreement  the upfront payments must be returned on a pro rata basis to the vendor 
if the contract does not specify that the rebate is earned as product is purchased  then the upfront payments are recorded as a liability when received and recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold on a pro rata basis as the product is sold

compensation expense continues to be recorded over the vesting period of the award 
the company intends to adopt sfas r using the modified prospective transition method which will require a cumulative adjustment for the difference  if any  in the amount of accrued compensation expense recorded as of december  and the amount required under the provisions of sfas r 
the company is still in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas r will have on its consolidated financial statements
