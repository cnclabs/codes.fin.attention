item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations further explains the impacts of these conditions on our operating results 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the federal emergency management agency fema contracted with various factory built homebuilders to produce and deliver approximately  manufactured homes in connection with its hurricane katrina relief efforts 
as a result of our contract with fema  we produced and delivered homes totaling million in net sales during fiscal excluding the shipments to fema  manufactured housing industry shipments have been flat at a year industry low for calendar years ended  and factory built operations our factory built operations consist of the production and sale of manufactured homes and modular homes 
our manufactured homes are constructed in accordance with the federal manufactured home construction and safety standards hud regulations 
approximately of the homes we produced in fiscal  including single section homes sold to fema  were built to hud regulations 
the remaining of homes we produced were modular homes  which are built in accordance with state or local building codes 
the following table sets forth the total factory built homes sold as well as the number of manufacturing facilities we operated for the fiscal years indicated fiscal year ended march  march  march  march  march  factory built homes sold single section multi section modular total factory built homes sold operating manufacturing facilities at end of fiscal year 
table of contents the principal materials used in the production of our factory built homes include wood  wood products  gypsum wallboard  steel  fiberglass insulation  carpet  vinyl  fasteners  appliances  electrical items  windows and doors 
we believe that the materials used in the production of our factory built homes are readily available from a wide variety of suppliers and the loss of any single supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our business 
the two suppliers which accounted for more than of our total purchases during the fiscal year ended march  represented and  respectively  of our total purchases during the fiscal year ended march  prices of certain materials such as lumber  gypsum  steel and insulation can fluctuate significantly due to changes in supply and demand 
although we and others in the industry typically have been able to pass higher material costs on to the consumer through price increases  such increases typically lag the escalation of material costs 
no assurances can be made that we will be able to pass these costs on in future years 
we received the manufactured housing institute s mhi national industry award for manufacturer of the year in april mhi is the national trade organization representing all segments of the manufactured and modular housing industry  including manufacturers  retailers  community owners  suppliers  financial institutions  state associations and developers 
all mhi members were eligible to vote in the selection process  making this award one of the most prestigious honors bestowed in the industry 
manufactured homes we manufacture single and multi section manufactured homes under various brand names including palm harbor  masterpiece  keystone  countryplace  river bend and windsor homes 
approximately of the manufactured homes we produced in fiscal were multi section as compared to in fiscal excluding the single section homes we produced for fema  of the homes we produced in fiscal were multi section 
we offer over floor plans  ranging in size from approximately to  square feet 
approximately of the manufactured homes we produce are structurally or decoratively customized to the homebuyer s specifications 
although we produce a wide price range of manufactured homes  the average retail sales price excluding land of our manufactured homes was approximately  during fiscal our homes are manufactured in indoor facilities  which have approximately  square feet of floor space and employ an average of associates who generally work one shift per day  five days per week 
construction of our homes is performed in stages using an assembly line process 
each section is permanently attached to a steel support chassis  various components such as floors  interior and exterior walls and a roof are added and function testing is performed 
we currently manufacture a typical manufactured home in approximately five days 
our facilities have the capacity to produce an aggregate of approximately sections per day 
the current rate of production is sections per day 
our typical manufactured home contains two to five bedrooms  a living room  family room  dining room  kitchen  two or three bathrooms and features central air conditioning and heating  a range  refrigerator  carpeting and drapes 
in addition  we offer optional amenities  including dishwashers  washers  dryers  furniture packages and specialty cabinets  as well as a wide range of colors  moldings and finishes 
optional features usually associated with site built homes such as stone fireplaces  ceramic tile floors  showers and countertops  computer rooms  skylights  vaulted ceilings and whirlpool baths are also offered 
we have a unique package of energy saving construction features referred to as energmiser which includes  among other things  additional insulation to reduce heating and cooling costs  which exceeds statutorily mandated energy efficiency levels 
we were recognized as a leader in energy efficient construction when we received the gold energyvalue housing award in the factory built home hot climate category by the national association of home builders research center 
we are constantly introducing new floor plans  decors  exteriors  features and accessories to appeal to changing trends in different regions of the country 
our manufactured homes are designed and copyrighted after extensive field research and consumer feedback 
we have developed engineering systems which  through the use of computer aided technology  permit customization of homes and assist with product development and enhancement 

table of contents the completed manufactured homes are transported by independent trucking companies to either the retail sales center or to the customer s site 
the transportation cost is borne by the independent retailer 
retailers or other independent installers are responsible for placing the manufactured home on site  joining the interior and exterior seams  making utility hook ups and  in certain instances  providing installation and finish out services 
the industry practice is to have third parties hired by the retailer provide the installation and finish out services 
our associates  rather than third parties  perform the installation and finish out services on manufactured homes sold 
we believe our finish out services ensure that our quality procedures are applied during the entire process and increase customer satisfaction  thereby providing us a competitive advantage 
our backlog of manufactured housing orders as of may  was approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of june  since retailers may cancel orders prior to production without penalty  we do not consider our order backlog to be firm orders  however  such cancellations rarely occur 
because of the seasonality of the manufactured housing market  the level of backlog generally declines during the winter months 
modular homes we manufacture modular homes through our wholly owned subsidiary  nationwide custom homes  inc nationwide operates two facilities in martinsville  virginia  one in arabi  georgia  and one in siler city  north carolina 
in addition  nine of our manufactured housing facilities produce modular homes principally under the brand name discovery custom homes 
we produce a wide price range of modular homes with an average retail sales price excluding land of  during fiscal our modular homes include single story ranch homes  split levels  cape cods and two and three story homes 
like a manufactured home  a typical modular home contains the standard rooms and features and offers optional amenities  decors  exteriors and floor plans 
each modular home is assembled in sections 
the process begins on a production line where a team of assemblers creates the floor and walls of the house 
the section is then wheeled down a tracked path where various stages of finish are performed and components are added from wiring and insulation early in the process to fixtures and floor coverings just prior to shipping 
modular homes are typically completed in one to two weeks 
the homes are shipped directly off the manufacturing line to the customer s site 
once on site  the homes are typically crane set on the foundation  the roof is raised and the final seam of roof shingles along the ridges of the roofline is applied 
we have won various awards for our modular product during the past year including a design award from the national modular housing council for best modular home over  square feet production category for our cambria model and the ohio manufactured housing association award for outstanding modular manufacturer of the year for enhancing the image of the manufactured and modular homes industry through outstanding customer service and business practices 
our backlog of modular orders as of may   was approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of june  retail our homes are sold through a distribution network consisting of retail superstores we own and independent dealers  builders and developers 
we had a shift in our distribution network from to to of our homes being sold by our company owned superstores and builder locations from fiscal to fiscal to fiscal  respectively 
excluding the homes sold to fema in fiscal  of our homes were sold by 
table of contents our company owned superstores and builder locations 
as we have executed our planned strategy of increasing sales of our modular homes  the percentage of homes sold to independent dealers  builders and developers has increased 
the following table sets forth the number of homes we sold through each of these distribution channels  as well as the number of company owned retail superstores and independent dealers  builders and developers during the past three fiscal years march  march  march  factory built homes sold by company owned superstores and builder locations independent dealers  builders and developers total number of company owned superstores and builder locations independent dealers  builders and developers total includes homes sold to fema in fiscal we first established company owned retail superstores in and currently have superstores in states 
a typical retail superstore consists of a sales office  which is a manufactured home  and factory built model homes of various sizes  floor plans  features and prices 
currently  of our retail superstores have modular model homes on display and many of our retail superstores also sell used and repossessed homes 
customers may purchase one of the model homes or may order a home that will be built at one of our manufacturing facilities and customized to meet their needs 
through nationwide  we have four builder locations in virginia and north carolina 
our typical builder location consists of a modular model home which serves as a sales office 
our independent retailer network principally consists of local dealers and builders that market land home packages and developers of communities 
no single independent retailer accounted for or more of our net sales during fiscal  or independent builders and developers approximately of the modular homes we sold in fiscal were sold through nationwide s independent distribution network  which consists of approximately local builders and developers with whom we have developed relationships through direct marketing  trade shows  the internet and referrals 
nationwide transports the home to the builder s developer s site and the builder developer contracts crews to lift the home with a crane onto its foundation and subsequently perform the finish out services 
modular homes typically require a larger amount of work to be done on site to complete the production of the homes 
currently nine of our manufactured housing facilities also build modular homes and sell homes directly to builders and developers 
approximately of the modular homes we sold in fiscal were sold from these nine facilities directly to builders and developers 
general contractors during fiscal  we began to serve as a general contractor for both manufactured and modular homes with respect to virtually all aspects of the sale and construction process in certain regions of the country 
this could include foundation work  driveways  landscape installations and other amenities the customer requests in addition to the home 
we anticipate expanding this role to additional geographic regions in future periods 
during fiscal year  we completed jobs for our company owned superstores and builder locations and for independent dealers  builders and developers 

table of contents markets served during the fiscal year ended march   the percentage of our revenues by region was as follows region primary states percentage of revenue by region southeast florida  north carolina  alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  tennessee  virginia  west virginia  maryland  connecticut  delaware central texas  oklahoma  arkansas  louisiana west new mexico  arizona  california  colorado  oregon  washington  montana  nevada  idaho midwest ohio  michigan  indiana  kentucky  illinois  pennsylvania  missouri the two states which accounted for greater than of our revenues were florida and texas with and  respectively  of total revenues 
factory built housing  which consists of manufactured housing and modular housing  is a regional business and the primary geographic market is within a mile radius for a manufactured housing facility and within a one to two day drive for a modular housing facility 
each of our manufactured housing facilities typically serves to retailers  and the facility sales staff maintains personal contact with each retailer  whether company owned or independent 
our decentralized operations allow us to be more responsive in addressing regional customer preferences of product innovation and home design 
consumer financing we maintain relationships with conventional lenders who provide two basic types of consumer financing in the factory built housing industry chattel or personal property loans for purchasers of a home with no real estate involved and land home and mortgage loans which finance the land  home and all improvements on the property 
there are two types of mortgage loans conforming and non conforming 
conforming loans conform to fha  va  freddie mac and fannie mae standards 
generally  the type of required foundations installed must conform to federal requirements and the borrower must meet certain criteria 
non conforming loans are financed by a major bank or lending institution which does not require a specific foundation type and have more flexible criteria 
beginning in fiscal and continuing through fiscal  many consumer lenders have tightened credit underwriting standards which has resulted in reduced lending volumes and lower sales volumes of manufactured homes 
some of our customers obtain third party construction financing  which allows for progress payments to be made to us at periodic intervals during the manufacturing  sale and closing process 
this type of financing is primarily available to those customers obtaining land home and mortgage loans  which finance the land  home and improvements of a piece of real property 
such third party construction financing through our customers is generally more advantageous to us in that the cash is received earlier and can be used for various corporate purposes 
in addition  we provide financing to our customers on competitive terms through our owned subsidiary  countryplace  and our investment as the sole limited partner in bsm 
through countryplace  we offer customary chattel loans and non conforming land home loans for manufactured homes 
through bsm  we offer conforming and non conforming mortgage financing for both modular and manufactured homes 
the loans originated through countryplace are held for our own investment portfolio and ultimately securitized whereas the mortgages originated through bsm are immediately sold in traditional secondary markets 
we believe that providing these financing alternatives to our customers improves our responsiveness to the financing needs of prospective purchasers and provides us with an additional source of earnings 

table of contents insurance we offer property and casualty insurance as well as extended warranties for owners of manufactured homes through our subsidiary  standard casualty 
during fiscal  and of homeowners who purchased a home through our own retail superstores purchased property and casualty insurance and extended warranties  respectively 
at the end of fiscal  standard casualty had approximately  policies in force 
wholesale financing in accordance with factory built housing industry practice  substantially all retailers finance a portion of their purchases of manufactured homes through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements 
under a typical floor plan financing arrangement  a financial institution provides the retailer with a loan for the purchase price of the home and maintains a security interest in the home as collateral 
the financial institution which provides financing to the retailer customarily requires us to enter into a separate repurchase agreement with the financial institution under which we are obligated  upon default by the retailer and under certain other circumstances  to repurchase the financed home at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement which generally ranges from to months 
the price at which we may be obligated to repurchase a home under these agreements is based upon our original invoice price plus certain administrative and shipping expenses 
our obligation under these repurchase agreements ceases upon the purchase of the home by the retail customer 
the risk of loss under such repurchase agreements is mitigated by the fact that i approximately of our homes are sold to independent dealers  builders and developers  ii a majority of the homes we sell to independent dealers  builders and developers are pre sold to specific retail customers  iii we monitor each dealer s  builder s and retailer s inventory position on a regular basis  iv sales of our manufactured homes are spread over a large number of dealers  builders and developers  v none of our independent dealers  builders and developers accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  vi the price we are obligated to pay declines over time and vii we are  in most cases  able to resell homes repurchased from credit sources in the ordinary course of business without incurring significant losses 
we estimate that our potential obligations under such repurchase agreements were approximately million as of march  during the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   we incurred losses under these repurchase agreements totaling   and  respectively 
beginning in fiscal  lenient credit standards  which had facilitated increased industry wide wholesale shipments in previous years  tightened  resulting in declining wholesale shipments  declining margins and lower retail sales levels for most industry participants through fiscal during this time  several major floor plan lenders have exited the wholesale financing business and a number of regional banks have either entered the retail financing business or increased their lending volumes 
competition the factory built housing industry is highly competitive at both the manufacturing and retail levels  with competition based upon several factors  including price  product features  reputation for service and quality  depth of field inventory  promotion  merchandising and the terms of retail customer financing 
in addition  manufactured and modular homes compete with new and existing site built homes  as well as apartments  townhouses and condominiums 
the efficiency of the assembly line process  protection from the weather and nationwide purchasing power enable us to produce a home in approximately one to two weeks and typically at a lower cost than a conventional site built home of similar quality 
we do not view any of our competitors as being dominant in the industry  although some of our competitors possess substantially greater manufacturing  distribution and marketing resources than us 
although many lenders to the factory built housing industry have reduced their volume or gone out of business  there are still competitors to countryplace and bsm in the markets where we do business 
these competitors include national  regional and local banks  independent finance companies  mortgage brokers and mortgage banks 
none of these competitors is considered to be dominant or to have a material impact on the financing opportunities at countryplace or bsm 

table of contents business segment information we operate principally in two segments factory built housing  which includes manufactured housing  modular housing and retail operations and financial services  which includes finance and insurance 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for information on our net sales  income loss from operations  identifiable assets  depreciation and amortization expense and capital expenditures by segment for fiscal  and government regulation our factory built homes are subject to a number of federal  state and local laws  codes and regulations 
construction of our manufactured homes is governed by the national manufactured housing construction and safety standards act of  as amended the home construction act 
in  the department of housing and urban development hud issued regulations under the home construction act establishing comprehensive national construction standards 
the hud regulations  known collectively as the federal manufactured home construction and safety standards  cover all aspects of manufactured home construction  including structural integrity  fire safety  wind loads  thermal protection and ventilation 
such regulations preempt conflicting state and local regulations on such matters  and are subject to continual change 
our manufacturing facilities and the plans and specifications of our manufactured homes have been approved by a hud certified inspection agency 
further  an independent hud certified third party inspector regularly reviews our manufactured homes for compliance with the hud regulations during construction 
failure to comply with applicable hud regulations could expose us to a wide variety of sanctions  including mandated closings of our manufacturing facilities 
we believe our manufactured homes meet or surpass all present hud requirements 
our modular homes are subject to state and or local codes with certification and regulation and we believe our modular homes meet all state and or local codes 
manufactured and site built homes are all typically built with some products that contain formaldehyde resins 
since february  hud has regulated the allowable concentrations of formaldehyde in certain products used in manufactured homes and requires manufacturers to warn purchasers as to formaldehyde associated risks 
the environmental protection agency and other governmental agencies have in the past evaluated the effects of formaldehyde 
we use materials in our manufactured homes that meet hud standards for formaldehyde emissions and believe we comply with hud and other applicable government regulations in this regard 
the transportation of factory built homes on highways is subject to regulation by various federal  state and local authorities 
such regulations may prescribe size and road use limitations and impose lower than normal speed limits and various other requirements 
our manufactured homes are subject to local zoning and housing regulations 
in certain cities and counties in areas where our homes are sold  local governmental ordinances and regulations have been enacted which restrict the placement of manufactured homes on privately owned land or which require the placement of manufactured homes in manufactured home communities 
such ordinances and regulations may adversely affect our ability to sell homes for installation in communities where they are in effect 
a number of states have adopted procedures governing the installation of manufactured homes 
utility connections are subject to state and local regulation and must be complied with by the retailer or other person installing the home 
our modular homes are also subject to local zoning regulations which govern the placement of homes 
certain of our warranties may be subject to the magnuson moss warranty federal trade commission improvement act  which regulates the descriptions of warranties on products 
the description and substance of our warranties are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations 
a number of states require manufactured home producers to post bonds to ensure the satisfaction of consumer warranty claims 
a variety of laws affect the financing of the homes we manufacture 
the federal consumer credit protection act truth in lending and regulation z promulgated thereunder require written disclosure of 
table of contents information relating to such financing  including the amount of the annual percentage rate and the finance charge 
the federal fair credit reporting act also requires certain disclosures to potential customers concerning credit information used as a basis to deny credit 
the federal equal credit opportunity act and regulation b promulgated thereunder prohibit discrimination against any credit applicant based on certain specified grounds 
the real estate settlement procedures act and regulation x promulgated thereunder require certain disclosures regarding the nature and costs of real estate settlements 
the federal trade commission has adopted or proposed various trade regulation rules dealing with unfair credit and collection practices and the preservation of consumers claims and defenses 
installment sales contracts eligible for inclusion in a government national mortgage association program are subject to the credit underwriting requirements of the federal housing association 
a variety of state laws also regulate the form of the installment sale contracts or financing documents and the allowable deposits  finance charge and fees chargeable pursuant to installment sale contracts or financing documents 
our sale of insurance products is subject to various state insurance laws and regulations which govern allowable charges and other insurance practices 
our operations are also subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  handling  emission  transportation and discharge of materials into the environment 
governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations  and violations may result in the payment of fines  the entry of injunctions or both 
the requirements of such laws and enforcement policies have generally become more strict in recent years 
accordingly  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with environmental laws and enforcement policies

risk factors certain statements contained in this annual report are forward looking statements within the safe harbor provisions of the securities litigation reform act 
forward looking statements give our current expectations or 
table of contents forecasts of future events and can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
investors should be aware that all forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and  as a result of certain factors  actual results could differ materially from these expressed in or implied by such statements 
these risks include such assumptions  risks  uncertainties and factors associated with the following financing for our retail customers may be limited  which could affect our sales volume 
our retail customers generally secure financing from third party lenders  which have been negatively affected by adverse loan experience 
several major lenders  which had previously provided financing for our customers  have withdrawn from the manufactured housing finance business 
reduced availability of such financing is currently having an adverse effect on the manufactured housing business and our home sales 
availability of financing is dependent on the lending practices of financial institutions  financial markets  governmental policies and economic conditions  all of which are largely beyond our control 
quasi governmental agencies such as fannie mae and freddie mac  which are important purchasers of loans from financial institutions  have tightened standards relating to the manufactured housing loans that they will buy 
most states classify manufactured homes as personal property rather than real property for purposes of taxation and lien perfection  and interest rates for manufactured homes are generally higher and the terms of the loans shorter than for site built homes 
financing for the purchase of manufactured homes is often more difficult to obtain than conventional home mortgages 
there can be no assurance that affordable retail financing for manufactured homes will continue to be available on a widespread basis 
if third party financing were to become unavailable or were to be further restricted  this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if countryplace is unable to adequately and timely service its loans  it may adversely affect its results of operations 
although countryplace has originated loans since  it has limited loan servicing and collections experience 
in  it implemented new systems to service and collect the portfolio of loans it originates 
the management of countryplace has industry experience in managing  servicing and collecting loan portfolios  however  many borrowers require notices and reminders to keep their loans current and to prevent delinquencies and foreclosures 
if there is a substantial increase in the delinquency rate that results from improper servicing or loan performance  the profitability and cash flow from the loan portfolio could adversely affect countryplace s ability to continue to securitize its loans 
if countryplace s customers are unable to repay their loans  countryplace may be adversely affected 
countryplace makes loans to borrowers that it believes are creditworthy based on its credit guidelines 
however  the ability of these customers to repay their loans may be affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to national  regional and local economic conditions  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  natural hazard risks affecting the region in which the borrower resides  employment  financial or life circumstances  and rising energy costs 
if customers do not repay their loans  the profitability and cash flow from the loan portfolio could adversely affect countryplace s ability to continue to securitize its loans 
if countryplace is unable to continue to securitize its loans  it will be required to seek other sources of long term funding  which funding may not be available 
the loans that are originated by countryplace are funded with proceeds from its warehouse borrowing facility and borrowings from us 
on july   countryplace successfully completed its initial securitization 
table of contents for approximately million of loans which were funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately million 
we anticipate countryplace will continue to securitize its loans as a primary source of funding 
the proceeds from future securitizations will be used to repay any borrowings from the warehouse facility and from us  as well as to originate new loans 
the securitization market is dependent upon a number of factors  including general economic conditions  conditions in the securities market generally and conditions in the asset backed securities market specifically 
although the asset backed securitization market for manufactured housing lenders has improved slightly in the past year in terms of access to the markets  as well as pricing and credit enhancement levels  poor performance of any loans we may securitize in the future could harm our future access to the securitization market 
if countryplace is unable to continue to securitize its loans on terms that are economical  or if there is a decline in the securitization market for manufactured housing loans  and if countryplace is unable to obtain additional sources of long term funding  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and business prospects 
increased prices and unavailability of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on us 
our results of operations can be affected by the pricing and availability of raw materials 
in fiscal   and we experienced an increase in the average prices of our raw materials of  and  respectively 
although we attempt to increase the sales prices of our homes in response to higher materials costs  such increases typically lag behind the escalation of materials costs 
many of the most important raw materials used in our operations have experienced significant price fluctuations in the past three fiscal years 
although we have not experienced any shortage of such building materials today  there can be no assurance that sufficient supplies of lumber  gypsum wallboard and insulation  as well as other materials  will continue to be available to us on terms we regard as satisfactory 
reduced availability of wholesale financing may adversely affect our inventory levels of new homes 
we finance a portion of our new inventory at our retail superstores through wholesale floor plan financing arrangements 
through these arrangements  financial institutions provide us with a loan for the purchase price of the home 
since the beginning of the industry downturn in  several major floor plan lenders have exited the floor plan financing business 
although we currently have a floor plan facility with a financial institution totaling million  there can be no assurance that we will continue to have access to such a facility or that we will not be forced to reduce our new home inventory at our retail superstores 
our repurchase agreements with floor plan lenders could result in increased costs 
in accordance with customary practice in the factory built housing industry  we enter into repurchase agreements with various financial institutions pursuant to which we agree  in the event of a default by an independent dealer  builder or developer in its obligation to these credit sources  to repurchase factory built homes at declining prices over the term of the agreements  typically to months 
the difference between the gross repurchase price and the price at which the repurchased home can then be resold  which is typically at a discount to the original sale price  is an expense to us 
thus  if we were obligated to repurchase a large number of factory built homes in the future  this would increase our costs  which could have a negative effect on our earnings 
tightened credit standards by lenders and more aggressive attempts to accelerate collection of outstanding accounts with independent dealers  builders and developers could result in defaults by independent dealers  builders and developers and consequently repurchase obligations on our part may be higher than has historically been the case 
during fiscal  and  our losses incurred under these repurchase agreements totaled   and  respectively 
we are dependent on our principal executive officer and the loss of his service could adversely affect us 
we are dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts of our principal executive officer  larry h 
keener  chairman and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of our principal executive officer could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our continued growth is also dependent upon our ability to attract and retain additional skilled management personnel 

table of contents we are controlled by two shareholders  who may determine the outcome of all elections 
approximately of our outstanding common stock is beneficially owned or controlled by our chairman emeritus  lee posey and capital southwest corporation and its affiliates 
as a result  these shareholders  acting together  are able to determine the outcome of elections of our directors and thereby control the management of our business 
if inflation increases  we may not be able to offset inflation through increased selling prices 
if there is a material increase in inflation in the future  it is unlikely that we will be able to increase our selling prices to completely offset the material increase in inflation and as a result  our operating results may be adversely affected 
the manufactured housing industry is highly competitive and some of our competitors have stronger balance sheets and cash flow  as well as greater access to capital  than we do 
as a result of these competitive conditions  we may not be able to sustain past levels of sales or profitability 
the manufactured housing industry is highly competitive  with relatively low barriers to entry 
manufactured and modular homes compete with new and existing site built homes and to a lesser degree  with apartments  townhouses and condominiums 
competition exists at both the manufacturing and retail levels and is based primarily on price  product features  reputation for service and quality  retailer promotions  merchandising and terms of consumer financing 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  distribution and marketing resources than we do 
as a result of these competitive conditions  we may not be able to sustain past levels of sales or profitability 
if our retail customers are unable to obtain insurance for factory built homes  our sales volume and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we sell our factory built homes to retail customers located throughout the united states including in coastal areas  such as florida 
in fiscal  of our revenues were generated in florida 
some of our retail customers in these areas have experienced difficulty obtaining insurance for our factory built homes due to adverse weather related events in these areas  primarily hurricanes 
if our retail customers face continued and increased difficulty in obtaining insurance for the homes we build  our sales volume and results of operations may be adversely affected 
our business is highly cyclical and there may be significant fluctuations in our quarterly results 
the factory built housing industry is highly cyclical and seasonal and has experienced wide fluctuations in aggregate sales in the past 
we are subject to volatility in operating results due to external factors beyond our control such as access to capital markets  the level and stability of interest rates  unemployment trends  the availability of retail financing  the availability of wholesale financing  the availability of homeowners insurance in coastal markets  housing supply and demand  industry availability of used or repossessed manufactured homes  international tensions and hostilities  
table of contents levels of consumer confidence  inventory levels  severe weather conditions  regulatory and zoning matters  and changes in general economic conditions 
sales in our industry are also seasonal in nature  with sales of homes traditionally being stronger in the spring  summer and fall months 
the cyclical and seasonal nature of our business causes our revenues and operating results to fluctuate and makes it difficult for management to forecast sales and profits in uncertain times 
as a result of seasonal and cyclical downturns  results from any quarter should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future quarters 
we are concentrated geographically  which could harm our business 
in fiscal  of our revenues were generated in florida and of our revenues were generated in texas 
a decline in the demand for factory built housing in these two states and or a decline in the economies of these two states could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are a limited partner in bsm financial  lp and if its business is adversely affected  our results of operations may also be adversely affected 
we have an investment of approximately million in a mortgage banking firm  bsm financial lp through our investment as the sole limited partner in bsm  we offer conforming and non conforming mortgages 
as a limited partner  we do not have the legal authority to manage or control bsm s operations 
therefore  if bsm s operations are not financially successful or their portfolio does not perform as expected  our results of operations may also be adversely affected and we could lose some or all of our investment in bsm

in late  we removed an underground storage tank formerly used to store gasoline from the site of our tempe  arizona manufacturing facility 
we are currently working in cooperation with the arizona department of environmental quality to assess and respond to gasoline related hydrocarbons detected in soil and groundwater at this site 
under certain circumstances  a state fund may be available to compensate responsible parties for petroleum releases from underground storage tanks 
we are evaluating the extent of the corrective action that 
table of contents may be necessary 
site characterization is complicated by the presence of contaminants associated with the indian bend wash area superfund site described below 
at this time  we do not expect that the costs of any corrective action or assessments related to the tank will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our tempe facility is partially located within a large area that has been identified by the epa as the indian bend wash area superfund site 
under federal law  certain persons known as potentially responsible parties prps may be held strictly liable on a joint and several basis for all cleanup costs and natural resource damages associated with the release of hazardous substances from a facility 
the average cost to clean up a site listed on the national priorities list is over million 
the indian bend superfund site is listed on the national priorities list 
groups of prps may include current owners and operators of a facility  owners and operators of a facility at the time of disposal of hazardous substances  transporters of hazardous substance and those who arrange for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances at a site 
no government agency  including the epa  has indicated that we have been or will be named as a prp or that we are otherwise responsible for the contamination present at the indian bend superfund site 
in general  although no assurance can be given as to the future actions of either the epa or prps who may incur cleanup costs related to this site  we do not believe that our ownership of property partially located within the indian bend superfund site will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in  we removed two underground storage tanks used to store petroleum substances from property we own in georgia 
in november  we received a letter from the georgia department of natural resources indicating no further action was necessary with respect to these storage tanks 
the letter  however  did not preclude additional action by the state if contaminants were found in adjoining properties 
at this time  we do not expect that the costs of future assessment and corrective action related to the tanks will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

on june   we acquired nationwide custom homes  inc  a manufacturer and marketer of modular homes 
nationwide contributed million in revenues and million in income from operations in fiscal 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are one of the nation s leading manufacturers and marketers of factory built homes 
we market nationwide through vertically integrated operations  encompassing manufactured and modular housing  chattel and mortgage bank financing  as well as insurance 
as of march   we operated manufacturing facilities that sell homes through company owned retail superstores and builder locations and approximately independent retail dealers  builders and developers 
through our owned subsidiary  countryplace  we offer chattel and non conforming land home loans to purchasers of manufactured homes 
through our investment as the sole limited partner in bsm  we offer conforming and non conforming mortgages for both modular and manufactured homes 
the loans originated through countryplace are held for our own investment portfolio and ultimately securitized whereas the mortgages originated through bsm are immediately sold in traditional secondary markets 
we also provide property and casualty insurance for owners of manufactured homes through our wholly owned subsidiary  standard casualty 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the federal emergency management agency fema contracted with palm harbor to purchase all of our retail inventory of single section homes at wholesale prices 
additionally  we received a purchase order from fema to produce and deliver single section housing units by december  as of march   we had shipped homes totaling million in net sales to fema 
on july   through our subsidiary countryplace  we successfully completed our initial securitization for approximately million of loans  which were funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately million 
the assets are chattel loans originated by company owned retail locations with the collateral being primarily palm harbor manufactured homes built in company owned factories 
see liquidity and capital resources for further details on this transaction 
the securitization completes another step towards our strategy of expanding our consumer financing capabilities through countryplace and our partnership in bsm 
during fiscal  countryplace originated loans and bsm originated  mortgages  of which were for palm harbor customers 
for fiscal  of our retail customers were financed by either countryplace or bsm 
during fiscal  we began to serve as a general contractor for both manufactured and modular homes with respect to virtually all aspects of the sale and construction process in certain regions of the country 
this could include foundation work  driveways  landscape installations and other amenities the customer requests in addition to the home 
we anticipate expanding this role to additional geographic regions in future periods 
during fiscal year  we completed jobs for our company owned superstores and builder locations and for independent dealers  builders and developers 
while the manufactured housing industry is still in a downturn as a result of the tightening of credit standards that began in  the modular housing industry has many growth opportunities 
the modular buyer is typically attracted from the site built market  rather than the manufactured housing market and therefore has more financing alternatives available to them 
there are also more opportunities to vary the exterior look of the house with modular homes as the state and local codes are less restricting than hud code 
also  modular homes have more options for placement of the home 
our modular products continued to gain momentum during fiscal due to the favorable response from dealers and builders 
revenues from our modular products were up approximately percent from fiscal and now account for over percent of our recurring revenues 
we expect this percentage to increase in future quarters

fiscal year was comprised of weeks while fiscal years and were each comprised of weeks 
as a result  there was an approximately increase in each of the categories discussed below in the compared to section of our results of operations 
as this change impacted all the income statement categories in a reasonably consistent manner  no separate discussion of this factor is included in this section  unless the impact of the applicable category varied from the increase described above 
compared to net sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales for the factory built housing segment increased million due to selling homes to fema and million due to a increase in new factory built homes sold excluding the homes sold to fema  a shift in product mix to modular homes of total factory built revenues  excluding the million of net sales to fema  in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and an increase in the average selling price of new manufactured and modular homes 
the increase in homes sold stemmed from increased market 
table of contents share and the increase in average selling prices resulted from customers purchasing larger  more complex homes as well as the pass through of higher raw material costs 
the average retail selling price of a new modular home increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  the average wholesale selling price of a new modular home increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and the average wholesale selling price of a new manufactured home increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal 
financial services revenue increased million reflecting an increase in interest income at countryplace resulting from an increase in consumer loans receivable from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to  or million  from  or million  in fiscal gross profit for the factory built housing segment increased million from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal this improvement reflects a strengthening of gross margin at our retail superstores  reduced availability of repossessed homes at discounted prices and increased sales prices due to customers purchasing larger  more complex homes and our ability to pass through higher raw material costs 
in addition  gross margin for fiscal was reduced million due to our closing of our least productive sales centers and streamlining our retail operations 
we were able to increase gross margin despite a decline in the internalization rate from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit for the financial services segment increased million due to the increase in net sales as explained above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased million for general corporate purposes  million for factory built housing and million for financial services 
the increase in general corporate expenses is due primarily to increases in incentive based compensation as we return to profitability and the increase in factory built housing expenses is due primarily to costs associated with our site construction operations  costs related to hiring it consultants as we make system enhancements and an increase in incentive based compensation as we return to profitability offset by a reduction in expenses resulting from operating fewer company owned retail superstores in fiscal as compared to fiscal average number of open stores was in fiscal compared to in fiscal 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to a million increase in fiscal of interest expense incurred on the securitized loans offset by a million decrease in interest expense incurred on the warehouse revolving debt 
the warehouse revolving debt interest decreased due to a significant decline in the warehouse revolving debt balance after million of borrowings were repaid with proceeds from the securitization 
equity in earnings loss of limited partnership 
equity in earnings loss of limited partnership increased to million of earnings in fiscal as compared to a million loss in fiscal this increase is primarily due to our share of bsm earnings increasing due to total originations of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal interest income and other 
interest income and other increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to a million increase in interest and dividend income earned on larger cash and cash equivalents and available for sale investment balances as well as higher interest rates  offset by a million decrease in income earned on a real estate investment 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax expense increased to million in fiscal as compared to a benefit of million in fiscal this increase is the result of pretax earnings of million in fiscal versus a pretax loss of million in fiscal the effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to a credit of in fiscal 
table of contents compared to net sales 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales for the factory built housing segment increased million primarily due to a shift in product mix to modular homes which have a higher average selling price than manufactured homes  for modular homes compared to  for manufactured homes 
the number of modular homes sold during fiscal increased compared to fiscal and comprised of total factory built home sales in fiscal versus in fiscal financial services revenue increased million reflecting an increase in the number of renewals of insurance policies at standard casualty and an increase in interest income at countryplace resulting from an increase in consumer loans receivable from million at the end of fiscal to million at the end of fiscal gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to  or million  from  or million  in fiscal gross profit for the factory built housing segment decreased million from of net sales in fiscal to of net sales in fiscal this decrease is principally the result of million of charges related to closing of our least productive sales centers and streamlining our retail operations in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  the internalization rate  which is the percentage of factory built homes we manufactured and sold through our company owned retail superstores and builder locations  decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit for the financial services segment increased million due to the increase in net sales as explained above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses for factory built housing decreased million in fiscal due to a focus on reducing costs  offset by million in charges associated with closing under performing sales centers 
selling  general and administrative expenses for general corporate purposes decreased million primarily resulting from a million decrease in advertising costs  million decrease in workers compensation reserves due to the reduction in our workforce several years ago  million decrease in expenses related to the long term incentive plan which was modified in fiscal  and million decrease in salaries and bonuses offset by million increase in expenses related to becoming sarbanes oxley compliant 
selling  general and administrative expenses for financial services increased million primarily due to additional expenses related to commissions and amortization of debt issue costs associated with the expansion of countryplace 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to a million increase in interest expense incurred on the warehouse revolving debt and hedge facility and million in interest expense incurred on the million convertible senior notes that were issued during the first quarter of fiscal this increase is offset by a million reduction in flooring interest resulting from a decrease in the floor plan liability from million at march  to million at march  equity in earnings loss of limited partnership 
equity in earnings loss of limited partnership decreased to a million loss in fiscal as compared to million of earnings in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to our share of operating losses at bsm increasing due to a lesser number of mortgage refinance originations in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income and other 
interest income and other increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to a million increase in income earned on a real estate investment 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at march   up from million at march  during fiscal  net cash used in operating activities totaled million and consisted of million used for originating loans at countryplace and million used to increase inventory as the pipeline of 
table of contents customer sold  but undelivered homes increased  offset by million provided by principal payments on loans originated  and million provided by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  resulting from increased customer deposits  as evidenced by our increase in backlog and traffic at our retail sales centers  and increases in our days payable outstanding and deferred revenue 
net cash used in investing activities consisted of million used for net purchases of property  plant and equipment and million of net purchases of investments by standard casualty 
net proceeds from the securitized financing of million and net proceeds on floor plan liabilities of million were offset by net payments on the warehouse facility of million and payments on securitized financing of million to contribute to the million in net cash provided by financing activities 
we have an agreement with a financial institution for a million floor plan facility 
the advance rate for the facility is of manufacturer s invoice 
this facility is used to finance a portion of the new home inventory at our retail superstores and is secured by new home inventory and a portion of receivables from financial institutions 
the interest rate on the facility is prime at march  or prime plus to for aged units  of which we have none as of march  the floor plan facility contains certain provisions requiring us to maintain minimum amounts of liquidity  profitability  inventory turns and tangible net worth in order to borrow against the facility 
as of march   we were in compliance with these provisions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we amended the agreement with the financial institution to revise the minimum tangible net worth provision for fiscal  to change the interest rate to prime plus and to extend the expiration of the agreement from may  to march  we had million and million outstanding under these floor plan credit facilities at march  and march   respectively 
on may   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes in a private  unregistered offering 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in may and november 
on june   the initial purchaser of the notes exercised its option to purchase an additional million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
on september   for the benefit of the note holders  the company filed a shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and the shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of the notes 
the notes are senior  unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future unsecured and senior indebtedness 
each  in principal amount of the notes is convertible  at the option of the holder  at a conversion price of  or shares of our common stock upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and contingencies 
for fiscal years  and  the effect of converting the senior notes to  shares of common stock was anti dilutive  and was  therefore  not considered in determining diluted earnings per share 
on july   our owned subsidiary countryplace  completed its initial securitization for approximately million of loans  which was funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately million 
the bonds were issued in four different classes class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  and class a totaling million with a coupon rate of 
maturity of the bonds is at varying dates beginning in through and were issued with a weighted average maturity of years 
the proceeds from the securitization were used to repay approximately million of borrowings on our warehouse revolving debt with the remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes  including future origination of new loans 
for accounting purposes  this transaction was structured as a securitized borrowing 
countryplace has an agreement with a financial institution for a warehouse borrowing facility to fund loans originated by countryplace 
the facility is collateralized by specific consumer loans receivable pledged to the facility 
the facility terminates march   however  amounts outstanding under the facility are effectively settled and re borrowed on a monthly basis 
upon renewal on march   the warehouse facility was amended to reduce the maximum borrowing amount from million to million  increase the advance against the outstanding principle balance of eligible consumer loan receivables to  and to provide for draws at an advance rate against land home loans in various stages of completion 
the interest rate remains libor plus 
countryplace had outstanding borrowings under the warehouse facility of million as of march  and million as of march  the facility contains certain requirements relating 
table of contents to the performance and composition of the consumer loans receivable pledged to the facility and financial covenants regarding maintenance of a certain loan delinquency ratio  minimum ratio of liabilities to stockholders equity for countryplace and a minimum capitalization for countryplace  which is customary in the industry 
as of march   countryplace was in compliance with these requirements 
as countryplace continues to expand and draw down on its warehouse facility  we will fund the difference between the amounts advanced under the warehouse borrowing facility and the balance of any additional loan originations 
for countryplace to increase its borrowings under the facility to the maximum million  countryplace would have to originate an additional million of new loans  of which million would have to be funded through our operations 
upon completion of the securitization  countryplace extinguished its interest rate swap agreement on million of its variable rate debt which was used to hedge against an increase in variable interest rates 
the agreement previously fixed the interest rate on million of countryplace s variable rate  long term warehouse revolving debt to per annum 
countryplace recorded the hedge instrument at fair value as of the end of each fiscal quarter with the effective offsetting portion of the hedge being recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion  if any  of the hedge being recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
during fiscal and  countryplace had no significant ineffectiveness 
the fair value of the hedge upon its extinguishment in fiscal was immaterial 
countryplace currently intends to originate and hold loans for investment on a long term basis 
countryplace makes loans to borrowers that it believes are credit worthy based on its credit guidelines 
however  originating and holding loans for investment subjects countryplace to more credit and interest rate risk than the previous business practice of originating loans for resale 
the ability of customers to repay their loans may be affected by a number of factors and if customers do not repay their loans  the profitability and cash flow of the loan portfolio would be adversely affected 
countryplace intends to securitize its loan portfolio on a routine basis 
while we believe it will be able to obtain additional liquidity through the securitization of such loans  no assurances can be made that countryplace will successfully complete securitization transactions on acceptable terms and conditions  if at all 
we believe that the proceeds from the securitization  the issuance of the convertible senior notes  floor plan financing  borrowings on the warehouse facility and any other available borrowing alternatives will be adequate to support our working capital needs  currently planned capital expenditure needs and expansion of countryplace for the foreseeable future 
however  because future cash flows and the availability of financing will depend on a number of factors  including prevailing economic and financial conditions  business  the market for asset backed securitizations  and other factors beyond our control  no assurances can be given in this regard 
loan portfolio prior to the third quarter of  countryplace originated loans and immediately sold them to other lenders 
during the third quarter of  we executed our planned strategy and expanded countryplace into a full service chattel lender with originating  servicing and securitization capabilities 
in the first quarter of fiscal  countryplace completed its initial securitization for million of loans 
as a result of the expansion  our loan portfolio has grown at an annual rate of  and in fiscal  and  respectively  reflecting the build up of our lending operations 
all loan contracts are fixed rate  simple interest contracts and have monthly scheduled payments of principal and interest 
the scheduled payments for each simple interest contract would  if made on their respective due dates  result in a nearly full amortization of the contract 
the loan contracts have the following maturities as of march  million are due in less than one year  million are due between one and five years and million are due after five years 
non performing loan contracts include non accrual loan contracts and foreclosed assets held for resale 
loan contracts are placed in non accrual status when countryplace determines that foreclosure is imminent as a result of a clear indication that the borrower has the inability or unwillingness to meet payments as they become 
table of contents due 
as of march  and march   countryplace had non performing loans totaling million and million  respectively 
as of march  and march   countryplace also had million and million  respectively  of accruing loans past due days or more 
countryplace occasionally restructures troubled loan contracts by deferring or waiving all or part of interest  principal  tax escrow  insurance premium  fees  or other amounts owed to them by their customers 
countryplace s policies and guidelines  as well as certain contractual obligations in their securitization transaction  limit the number and the frequency of deferments and waivers that may be granted 
a loan contract for which delinquent payments are deferred is classified as current at the time the deferment is granted and therefore is not included as a delinquent account 
loan contracts subject to a payment deferral  as a percentage of the number outstanding loan contracts  were as follows march  march  number of outstanding loan contracts percentage of loans with deferred payments the deferrals in fiscal year are a direct result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
the loan contracts are principally secured by factory built homes that are geographically concentrated in texas 
approximately and of the principal balance of the loan contracts receivable as of march  and march   respectively  were secured by collateral located in texas 
if texas experiences weaker economic conditions  greater rates of decline in manufactured home values  greater rates of decline in real estate values  or natural disasters than the united states generally  then the loan contracts may experience higher rates of delinquencies  default and foreclosure losses than manufactured homes that are more geographically dispersed 
the risks created by these concentrations have been considered by management in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover estimated losses on loans at each balance sheet date 
no other states had concentrations in excess of of the loan contracts receivable balance as of march  or march  contractual obligations dollars in thousands the following tables summarize our contractual obligations  including interest  at march  for additional information related to these obligations  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years floor plan payable debt obligations warehouse revolving debt convertible senior notes securitized financing repurchase obligations letters of credit operating lease obligations total contractual obligations interest is calculated by applying contractual interest rates to march  balances 
we have contingent repurchase obligations outstanding at march  which have a finite life but are replaced as we continue to sell our factory built homes to dealers under repurchase agreements with financial institutions 
our losses related to these contingent repurchase obligations were   and  during fiscal   and  respectively 
for additional information on our repurchase obligations  see critical accounting policies reserve for repurchase obligations 

table of contents we have provided letters of credit to providers of certain of our insurance policies 
while the current letters of credit have a finite life  they are subject to renewal at different amounts based on the requirements of the insurance carriers 
we have recorded insurance expense based on anticipated losses related to these policies as is customary in the industry 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets on an annual basis  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
recovery of deferred tax asset 
we believe it is more likely than not we will recover all of our net deferred tax assets 
recovery of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  which we currently believe will come from future profitable operating results and available tax planning strategies 
should we operate unprofitably  or otherwise change our estimate of future profitable operations  we may need to record a valuation allowance on all or a part of our deferred tax assets 
net deferred tax assets at march  and march  are million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition 
retail sales of manufactured homes and certain single story modular homes  including shipping charges  are recognized when a down payment is received  the customer enters into a legally binding sales contract  title has transferred and the home is accepted by the customer  delivered and permanently located at the customer s site 
additionally  for retail sales of all multi story modular homes  nationwide modular homes  and manufactured homes in which we serve as the general contractor with respect to virtually all aspects of the sale and construction process  revenue is not recognized until after final consumer closing 
transportation costs  unless borne by the retail customer or independent retailer  are included in the cost of sales 
warranties 
we provide the retail homebuyer a one year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure  plumbing and electrical systems 
we record a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold  based upon our assessment of historical experience factors 
factors we use in the estimation of the warranty liability include historical warranty experience related to the actual number of calls and the average cost per call 
although we maintain reserves for such claims based on our assessments as described above  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material effect on our results of operations and liquidity 
reserve for repurchase obligations 
factory built housing companies enter into repurchase agreements with financial institutions which have provided wholesale floor plan financing to independent dealers  builders and developers 
these agreements generally provide that in the event of an independent dealer  builder or 
table of contents developer s default we will repurchase the financed home from the lending institution at declining prices over the term of the repurchase agreement generally months 
the risk of loss under such repurchase agreements is mitigated by the fact that i approximately of our homes are sold to independent dealers  builders and developers  ii a majority of the homes we sell to independent dealers  builders and developers are pre sold to specific retail customers  iii we monitor each dealer s  builder s and developer s inventory position on a regular basis  iv sales of our manufactured homes are spread over a large number of dealers  builders and developers  v none of our independent dealers  builders and developers accounted for more than of our net sales in fiscal  vi the price we are obligated to pay declines over time and vii we are  in most cases  able to resell homes repurchased from credit sources in the ordinary course of business without incurring significant losses 
transfers of financial assets 
countryplace completed its initial securitization of manufactured housing loan receivables in fiscal the securitization was accounted for as a financing  which uses the portfolio method of accounting in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  where loan contracts are securitized and accounted for as borrowings  interest income is recorded over the life of the loans using the interest method  the loan contracts receivable and the securitization debt asset backed certificates remain on countryplace s balance sheet  and the related interest margin is reflected in the income statement 
this accounting has been utilized since july   the date of issue of the company s only securitized financing 
the securitization includes provisions for removal of accounts by countryplace that preclude sale accounting of the securitization under sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the structure of countryplace s securitization has no effect on the ultimate amount of profit and cash flow recognized over the life of the loan contracts  except to the extent of surety fees and premiums  trustee fees  backup servicer fees  and securitization issuance costs 
however  the structure does affect the timing of cash receipts 
countryplace services the loan contracts under a pooling and servicing agreement with the securitization trust 
countryplace also retains interests in subordinate classes of securitization bonds that provide over collateralization credit enhancement to senior certificate holders and are subject to risk of loss of interest payments and principal 
as is common in securitizations  countryplace is also liable for customary representations 
we guarantee certain aspects of countryplace s performance as the servicer under the securitizations pooling and servicing agreement 
allowance for loan losses 
countryplace originates and holds for investment purposes loans related primarily to the retail sale of our factory built homes  with such loans being collateralized primarily by the factory built home 
countryplace provides allowances for estimated future loan losses at the time of sale and during the term of the loan 
the allowance for loan losses gives consideration to the composition of the loan portfolio  including borrower credit scores  loan characteristics  number of delinquencies and historical loss experience  known losses due to existing repossessed homes  expected losses due to specific customer delinquencies  expected future losses based on industry experience of losses for a given credit score and current economic conditions 
although countryplace maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon these expectations and other criteria  future differences between countryplace s expectations with respect to loan losses and actual losses incurred in the portfolio could differ  and require countryplace to increase its allowance 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas requires that fixed production costs be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities and that unallocated overheads be recognized as an expense in the periods in which they are incurred 
in addition  other items such as abnormal freight  handling costs and amounts of excess spoilage require treatment as current period charges rather than as a portion of the inventory cost 
we adopted sfas in the fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transaction  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r permits entities to use any option pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the statement 
we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal we do not anticipate that the adoption of the standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt  which consists primarily of our liabilities under retail floor plan financing arrangements and warehouse revolving debt
