at june   we held no cash in the segregated account maintained in conjunction with a limited indemnity issued to citibank texas  na formerly first american bank  ssb 
the limited indemnity with citibank required us to indemnify citibank for up to million for any losses it realizes on its term loan to gshi resulting only from potential legal claims that might or could be asserted by certain third parties 
this limited indemnity was backed by the funds in the segregated account 
during the quarters ended december  and june   million and million of previously segregated funds were released to the company  respectively 
these reductions reflected a waiver of the segregated funds requirement due to the developments related to legal claims and prior payments by gshi to citibank texas  na critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or  gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reported period 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ 
the following are significant accounting policies consistently applied by prospect energy we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements 
so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and they are consistently applied by us investments a security transactions are recorded on a trade date basis 
b valuation investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations 
short term investments which mature in days or less  such as united states treasury bills  are valued at amortized cost  which approximates market value 
the amortized cost method involves valuing a security at its cost on the date of purchase and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of the difference between the principal amount due at maturity and cost 
short term securities which mature in more than days are valued at current market quotations by an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers if available  or otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer 
investments in money market mutual funds are valued at their net asset value as of the close of business on the day of valuation 
it is expected that most of the investments in the company s portfolio will not have readily available market values 
debt and equity securities whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value  with the assistance of an independent valuation service  using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process which is under the direction of our board of directors 
the factors that may be taken into account in fairly valuing investments include  as relevant  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  its estimated earnings and projected discounted cash flows  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the sensitivity of the investments to fluctuations in interest rates  the financial environment in which the portfolio company operates  comparisons to securities of similar publicly traded companies and other relevant factors 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value  the fair value of these investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments  and any such differences could be material 
c realized gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method 
d interest income adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount is recorded on an accrual basis 
e dividend income is recorded on the ex dividend date 
loan origination  facility  commitments  consent and other advance fees received by us on loan agreements or other investments are accreted into income over the term of the loan 
in determining the fair value of our portfolio investments at june   the audit committee considered valuations from the independent valuation firm and from management having an aggregate range of million to million
