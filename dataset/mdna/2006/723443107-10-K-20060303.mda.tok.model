item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook the following should be read in conjunction with item a 
risk factors and the liquidity and capital resources section of this item  both in this current report on form k  as these sections are necessary in understanding our outlook for on september   northwest filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
subsequent to northwest s chapter filing  we received a request from northwest to remove crj aircraft from service 
these aircraft were removed from the fleet effective november   bringing our total crj fleet from to aircraft 
northwest subsequently rejected its primary lease agreements with third party lessors on these aircraft in november we continued to receive fixed payments on these aircraft through november  we are not currently scheduled to take any additional deliveries of crj aircraft under our airline services agreement asa with northwest 
we believe our operations are integral to northwest s future growth and complement northwest s operations by allowing more frequent service to selected markets than could be provided economically with conventional large jet aircraft 
our regional jets operational capabilities allow us to service markets profitably that do not have enough passenger traffic to support northwest s mainline jet service 
on december   we received a request for proposal rfp from northwest 
under the rfp  regional airlines were asked to submit proposals to operate up to regional jets with capacity up to seats 
we have since provided an offer to northwest both to continue operating our current fleet of crj aircraft with some modifications to our current asa and to operate a number of aircraft on behalf of northwest with seating capacities up to seats 
we are discussing our rfp response with northwest  and we understand that northwest is also discussing rfp responses with several other regional airlines 
we expect that some of our competitors will offer to provide regional airline service to northwest on terms significantly more favorable to northwest than those contained in our current asa 
we believe that the best alternative for our shareholders is for us to continue our business relationship with northwest 
therefore  we will work with northwest to determine the mutually satisfactory conditions under which northwest will seek to assume the asa  and we understand that the economic terms of that arrangement are likely to be significantly less favorable to us than those contained in the current asa 
subject to certain restrictions  our asa allows us to establish separate operations to provide airline service to other major carriers 
we intend to actively pursue opportunities with other major airlines that are interested in entering into a business relationship with a high quality  cost efficient regional airline partner 
for any such opportunities  we would plan to use a separate airline subsidiary operating under a second air carrier certificate from the dot to provide services to another airline partner  although we do not currently have a separate certificated subsidiary for such purpose 
we have held informal discussions with other airlines in recent months and are participating in an ongoing request for proposal process to provide regional airline service to another major airline 
although we do not currently have any definitive plans for other new opportunities  we believe that our low cost structure and high operational reliability makes us an attractive candidate to provide regional airline service to others 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are currently restricted by the terms of our asa from operating aircraft with more than seats  even through the use of a separate operating subsidiary and separate air carrier certificate 
we believe that this scope restriction will be eliminated as part of negotiations with northwest during its bankruptcy proceedings 
the collective bargaining agreement between our company and the airline pilots association alpa  the union representing our pilots  became amendable in april we have been actively negotiating with alpa for the past several months 
we have informed alpa that we believe northwest will require successful resolution of our pilot contract negotiations as a condition to assuming our asa 
we expect to conclude negotiations shortly 
we are in the process of voluntarily adopting the standards of the air transportation oversight system atos prescribed by the faa 
atos is a system developed by the faa that allows air carriers to standardize their operating methods and procedures  providing for better coordination of the faa s role in monitoring and reviewing certificated air carriers 
implementing atos requires  among other things  standardizing certain flight operating procedures and policies 
we are not required to adopt atos but have chosen to do so voluntarily 
we completed the conversion of our manuals  policies and procedures to an atos compliant format during the fourth quarter of  and we are now assisting the faa in its review of our modifications 
we believe that adopting atos standards for our existing operations will also reduce the time to apply for and obtain a second air carrier operating certificate from the dot  because the second operating certificate would also have atos compliant manuals

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation the financial information for the year ended december  does not reflect what our financial position  results of operations and cash flows would have been had we been a stand alone entity during the periods presented 
prior to september  northwest was our majority owner and designed our operations to increase overall northwest system revenues rather than to maximize our stand alone profitability 
under our previous capacity purchase arrangements  northwest retained the ability to adjust the revenues and margins we would receive under those arrangements 
in contrast to the prior arrangements  the asa establishes the compensation structure for our services throughout the term of the agreement in a manner designed to better align our revenues and earnings with our underlying cost drivers  such as block hours and cycles

other revenues have primarily consisted of ground handling services that we provide to northwest  mesaba  and other carriers at certain airports 
revenue from ground handling services accounted for approximately of our total revenues in we will continue to account for our ground handling services in other revenues 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations basis of presentation continued a significant portion of the payments we receive from northwest are based on the actual operation of our aircraft 
northwest is solely responsible for scheduling flights  and the asa does not require northwest to meet any minimum utilization levels for our aircraft 
as noted in the discussion of our asa  we receive reimbursement of certain operating expenses necessary to provide regional airline capacity to northwest and payments based on pre set rates for fixed costs  completed block hours and completed cycles 
we also receive margin payments on these items which are intended to achieve a target operating margin 
our operating results are not significantly impacted by any seasonality trends historically associated with the airline industry 
our net income for the year ended december  was million 
this includes a loss  net of tax  of million  associated with the bankruptcies of northwest and mesaba discussed above and a nonrecurring pre tax gain of million million net of related income taxes from the retirement of the note payable to northwest that occurred in february on a pro forma basis  excluding the gain from the repurchase of the northwest note payable and the losses associated with the northwest and mesaba bankruptcy filings  our net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december   was million and  respectively  representing increases of over the same period in the following reconciles our operating and net income  operating margin and diluted earnings per share eps as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap for the years ended december  and to pro forma measures excluding the above described losses associated with the bankruptcy filings of northwest and mesaba and the gain associated with our february repurchase of debt

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared to the following summarizes our operating revenues and expenses as reimbursed and unreimbursed as provided for under the terms of our asa 
revenue and expense shown as reimbursed relate to those asa costs incurred by the company that are fully reimbursed  with margin  by northwest 
regional airline services revenue shown as unreimbursed is determined based on pre set rates under the asa for completed block hours  completed cycles and certain fixed costs and is intended to cover all of the our other operating costs

the increase in operating revenue of million was primarily caused by the addition of crj aircraft during  although of these aircraft were removed from the fleet effective november  northwest subsequently rejected its primary lease agreements with third party lessors on these aircraft in november we continued to receive fixed payments on these aircraft through november  crj block hours and cycles increased by and  respectively  causing increases in revenue  excluding margin  of million and million  respectively

regional airline services revenue per cycle increased by from  to  the variances in revenue per block hour and cycle are due primarily to an increase in the average length of our flights of over the same periods 
operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses during was primarily due to the previously discussed losses of million associated with the bankruptcy filings of northwest and mesaba 
excluding the losses due to bankruptcy filings  the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december  was due primarily to the growth in our level of operations 
total operating expenses increased by million and 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations salaries  wages and benefits increased by million  or  primarily due to the increase in the number of employees of  as well as wage rate and benefit increases 
an increase in other employee benefits  primarily the cost of employee insurance  accounted for the remaining increase in salaries  wages and benefits 
aircraft fuel expense increased million  or  due to the increase in block hours  which was partially offset by decreased fuel burn resulting primarily from an increase in the average length of our flights 
in accordance with the asa  passenger fuel costs are reimbursed in full by northwest and capped at per gallon 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expenses that are reimbursed by northwest increased principally due to required heavy airframe maintenance checks performed on our crj aircraft during heavy airframe maintenance checks were performed on aircraft during versus aircraft in this accounted for approximately million of the increase in reimbursed maintenance expenses 
the remaining increase in unreimbursed maintenance expense was due mainly to the increase in our level of operations and the expiration of warranty on a portion of our fleet 
aircraft rental expense increased million  or  due to the addition of aircraft to our fleet  although of these aircraft were removed from the fleet effective november  as previously noted  we sublease our crj aircraft from northwest under operating leases that expire december  the monthly lease rates include certain fleet management costs of northwest and are not representative of the rates paid by northwest to third party lessors 
northwest reimburses aircraft rental expense in full under the asa 
other rentals and landing fees increased due to an increase in landing fees of approximately million  or approximately  which is largely due to our increased level of operations and a change in the mix of cities where we provide passenger service 
ground handling services increased by million  or  due primarily to the increase in the number of departures performed 
the increase in ground handling expense per departure was caused by a change in the mix of cities where we provide passenger service 
other expenses that are reimbursed by northwest increased primarily due to increases in property taxes of million and passenger liability insurance of million 
the increase in unreimbursed other expenses was driven by our increased level of operations  most notably an increase of million of expenses associated with overnight travel for our pilots and flight attendants  and million in canadian air traffic control costs 
additionally  million of the increase is attributable to professional service expenses associated with state tax planning  the audit of our financial statements and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the process of obtaining our second air carrier certificate 
in february  we purchased the outstanding million note payable to northwest at a discounted purchase price of million 
as a result  nonoperating income for includes a gain of million  net of related fees  related to the repurchase of this debt 
income tax expense decreased by million from to this decrease was due to a decrease in our income before taxes caused by the charges associated with the bankruptcy filings of northwest and mesaba 
the impact of the decrease in income before taxes was partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate from to of points 
our income tax expense was reduced by million following a reduction in our previous estimate of tax obligations for excluding this item  our effective tax rate was and for the years ending december  and  respectively

regional airline services revenue per cycle increased by from  to  the variances in revenue per block hour and cycle are due primarily to an increase in the average length of our flights of over the same periods 
revenue from regional airline services for was negatively impacted by severe weather 
during the last week of december  adverse weather closed or reduced operations at over of the airports we serve 
these difficulties were in part responsible for a drop in our average performance statistics for the six months ended december  falling below the standards contained in the asa 
as a result  during the first quarter of  we paid northwest million in settlement of performance related penalties  an amount which was treated as a reduction in revenue in the fourth quarter of we implemented certain upgrades to those operational and communication systems that were overburdened as a result of the adverse weather 
operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses of during was primarily due to the increase in the size of our aircraft fleet 
operating expenses for the year ended december  included significant

the remaining increases in maintenance expense  both reimbursed and unreimbursed  were due mainly to the increase in our level of operations and the expiration of warranty on a portion of our fleet

the increase in unreimbursed other expenses was driven by our increased level of operations  most notably an increase of million of expenses associated with overnight travel for our pilots and flight attendants  million associated with new pilot training and million in canadian air traffic control costs 
additionally  million of the increase is attributable to increases in certain insurance premiums and due to professional service expenses associated with state tax planning and the compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of income tax expense was unchanged from to during the third quarter of  we lowered our income tax expense by approximately million following a reduction in a previous estimate of our tax obligations for the reduction in our estimate occurred following the filing of our state and federal income tax returns and was primarily due to changes in the apportionment of taxable income to those states where we operate 
this change in estimate increased our basic and diluted earnings per share by approximately for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in cash used for investing activities was million and cash provided by financing activities was million 
due to the timing of payments from northwest under the asa  our balance of cash and short term investments is typically at its highest level at the end of a month 
our balance of cash and short term investments can decline by as 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations much as million intra month as we meet regular operating cash flow needs prior to receiving revenue payments from northwest 
our liquidity was significantly impacted by northwest s bankruptcy filing on september  since that time  northwest has generally complied with the payment terms under the asa 
to the extent that northwest does not seek to materially alter the payment terms of the asa during its bankruptcy proceedings  we expect our cash flow from operations to be sufficient to meet our ongoing capital requirements and financial commitments 
however  we may have limited resources to pay the additional sublease security deposits to northwest described below under contractual obligations if we are required to do so in march  and we may have limited resources to repay our revolving credit facility described below under contractual obligations if it is accelerated prior to its maturity in june contractual obligations 
the following chart details our debt and lease obligations at december  payments due by period in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations senior convertible notes line of credit interest payments on long term debt operating leases additional aircraft deposits purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations borrowings outstanding as of december   under our revolving credit facility with first tennessee bank  which expires june  disputed additional aircraft deposits that the company believes are due in november northwest has demanded them to be paid by march  amounts represent noncancelable commitments to purchase goods and services  including certain aircraft parts and information technology 
amounts for include  for rentals owed under facility revenue bonds discussed below in guarantees and indemnification 
the amounts noted above for operating leases include billion of obligations for leased crj aircraft from northwest 
under the terms of the asa  we are reimbursed by northwest in full for aircraft rental expense 
for a more detailed discussion of operating leases  refer to note leases  under item of this form k 
in february  we repaid the outstanding amount of million on the line of credit with northwest and purchased the outstanding million note payable at a discounted purchase price of million 
the payments were made in connection with the private sale of million principal amount of our senior convertible notes due the notes 
holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on february   february   and february  at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the purchase date 
in addition  under certain circumstances  holders of the notes may convert them into the equivalent value of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of shares per  principal amount  representing an initial conversion price of 
upon conversion  we will pay the portion of the conversion value up to the principal amount of each note in cash  and any excess conversion value in cash or our common stock at our election 
for a more detailed discussion of note conversion features  refer to risks related to our business and operations in item a of this form k 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the notes generally trade in secondary markets at a premium to the value into which they could be converted 
for instance  at the time the notes were issued  if any of the conditions for conversion had been met  holders of the notes could have converted each  principal amount of notes into cash and stock totaling only because of this premium associated with the option value imbedded in the notes  we do not believe that a significant number of holders of the notes would choose to convert the notes prior to their maturity if any of the conditions allowing for conversion are met 
in the event that a significant number of the notes were converted prior to their maturity  we would use internally generated cash flow and  to the extent necessary  issue other debt or equity securities to raise additional capital to satisfy the cash requirements of such conversions 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per year  payable in cash semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year  beginning august  on june   we entered into a revolving credit facility the revolver with first tennessee bank 
the revolver is a one year commitment that allows for borrowings up to million 
advances under the revolver accrue interest at the bank s base rate  or at libor plus at our option 
the revolver is secured by our inventory of spare parts  ground equipment  and furniture and fixtures 
in september  we borrowed the maximum amount of million under the revolver  which remains outstanding at december  the revolver agreement contains certain financial covenants  including a minimum month end balance of cash and cash equivalents  a minimum working capital requirement  and a minimum net income test 
as of december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
however  we expect that we will not remain in compliance with all of these financial covenants during the first quarter of in addition  the revolver contains a provision requiring that  as a condition for draws under the revolver to remain outstanding  no material adverse change in our financial condition can have occurred since the inception of the revolver in june we are currently in discussions with first tennessee bank to provide for the revolver to remain in place at least until its stated term of june amounts noted above as disputed additional aircraft deposits relate to a demand given by northwest in september that we pay million in additional aircraft sublease security deposits in march the terms of our sublease agreements with northwest provide that northwest may request additional security deposits in the amount of million once the promissory note we issued to northwest has been paid in full 
at our request  northwest has extended the deadline for its demand to march  we expect that ultimately the amount of security deposits required by northwest as part of our future relationship will be addressed through our ongoing discussions concerning assumption of the asa 
if this issue is not resolved by march  or if northwest does not extend its deadline beyond march  then we may seek legal remedies to prevent payment of these security deposits to northwest 
we do not know whether we will be successful in avoiding these deposit payments 
any payments we would make as a result of this request would be classified as other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december   due primarily to cash generated from net income of million  which includes the after tax gain on repurchase of debt of million  offset by an increase in income taxes payable of million  payments withheld by northwest and other miscellaneous charges 
net cash provided by operating activities was million during the year ended december   due primarily to cash provided by net income of million 
investing activities 
investing activities consisted of property and equipment purchases of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our and results include payments of million and million  respectively  to acquire contractual rights from northwest related to amendment no 
to our asa 
investing activities in also consisted of net short term investments in marketable equity and debt securities of million 
for a more detailed information on short term investments  refer to note in item of this form k 
we have no significant capital commitments as of december  we expect capital expenditures for to be approximately million  primarily relating to crj aircraft rotable parts and tooling  software application and automation infrastructure projects and maintenance and ground equipment 
we are expecting to fund these expenditures with cash flows generated from our operations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
we received million in gross proceeds from the issuance of the notes 
the proceeds were primarily used to retire our note payable to northwest for million and to repay our borrowings under the northwest revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
additionally  we paid million to various third parties in debt issuance costs related to the issuance of the notes  and million in fees in connection with the repurchase of our long term debt 
as discussed above  we also drew million on our revolver 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
we made principal payments to northwest on our note payable in the amount of million and a payment on the revolving credit facility with northwest for million 
as of december   million of standby letters of credit were outstanding 
deferred tax asset 
in connection with the estimated losses for the bankruptcy filings of northwest and mesaba of million  we recorded a deferred tax benefit of million  which represents the future federal and state income tax deductions provided to the company from these losses 
should our ability to realize this future benefit be at risk because of certain federal and state limitations regarding the carry back of taxable losses  we may implement various tax strategies to immediately utilize this tax deduction 
among other things  one potential strategy would be for us to sell our claims against northwest and mesaba to a third party and thereby make final determination of the amount ultimately recovered  which would allow for an immediate tax benefit 
guarantees and indemnifications 
we are the guarantor of approximately million aggregate principal amount of tax exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon 
these bonds were issued by the memphis shelby county airport authority the authority and are payable solely from our rentals paid under a long term lease agreement with the authority 
the leasing arrangement is accounted for as an operating lease in the consolidated financial statements 
we are not in compliance with one of the covenants contained in the lease agreement  and have not been for several years 
we have informed the trustee for the bonds of this non compliance  and the trustee has not taken any action 
any payments that we might be required to make as a result of our failure to comply with all of the lease terms would be treated as prepaid rent and amortized over the remaining lease term 
we are party to numerous contracts and real estate leases in which it is common for us to agree to indemnify third parties for tort liabilities that arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the contract or occupancy of the leased premises 
in some cases  this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties  but usually excludes any liabilities caused by their gross negligence or willful misconduct 
additionally  we typically indemnify the lessors and related third parties for any environmental liability that arises out of or relates to our use of the leased premises 
in our aircraft lease agreements with northwest  we typically indemnify the prime lessor  financing parties  trustees acting on their behalf and other related parties against liabilities that arise from the manufacture  design  ownership  financing  use  operation and maintenance of the aircraft and for tort liability  whether or not these liabilities arise out of or relate to the negligence of these indemnified parties  except for their gross negligence or willful misconduct 
we expect that we would be covered by insurance subject to deductibles for most tort liabilities and related indemnities described above with respect to real estate we lease and aircraft we operate 
we do not expect the potential amount of future payments under the foregoing indemnities and agreements to be material 
off balance sheet arrangements 
none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with these leased assets  however  the lease agreements do not include a residual value guarantee  fixed price purchase option or other similar guarantees 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and an understanding of our results of operations 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require judgment 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in
