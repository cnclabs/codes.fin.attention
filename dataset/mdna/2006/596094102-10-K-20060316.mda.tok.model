item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of the company 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
it should also be read in conjunction with the caution about forward looking statements section at the end of this discussion 
overview the company is headquartered in middleburg  virginia and conducts its primary operations through two wholly owned subsidiaries  the bank and mig 
the bank is a community bank serving loudoun  fairfax and fauquier county  virginia with seven full service facilities and one limited service facility 
mig is a newly formed non bank holding company with two wholly owned subsidiaries  mtc and mia 
mtc is a trust company headquartered in richmond  virginia 
mia is a registered investment advisor headquartered in alexandria  virginia serving clients in states 
the company generates a significant amount of its income from the net interest income earned by the bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
the bank s cost of money is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses 
mig s subsidiaries  mtc and mia  generate fee income by providing investment management and trust services to its clients 
investment management and trust fees are generally based upon the value of assets under management  and  therefore can be significantly affected by fluctuation in the values of securities caused by changes in the capital markets 
in  the company continued to realize the benefit of high growth rates in both assets and net interest income 
by december   total assets reached million  an increase of 
total assets at december  were million 
total loans grew from million at december  to million at december   without sacrificing credit quality 
this is the largest single year increase in portfolio loans in the past years 
considering the current interest rate environment  the company has been cautious about the amount and type of loan growth it has added to the loan portfolio which resulted in non accrual loans of  or of total loans 
additional staff  a solid local economy and the relationship with stm contributed to the strong loan growth experienced 
at december   purcellville  reston and warrenton  the financial service centers which were fully operative under the business model  had outstanding loans of million  million and million  respectively 
total deposits increased million from million at december  to million at december  low cost deposits  including demand checking  interest checking and savings increased million or from the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  and continue to drive much of the growth in deposits 
higher cost time deposits  excluding brokered certificates of deposit  increased or million from the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increases in both lower cost and higher cost deposits contributed to the increase in interest expense 
the net interest margin declined from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decline is attributed to both the lower yields earned on loan growth due to the flattening of the yield curve and the steady rise in shorter term interest rates on deposits and borrowed money to fund the earning asset growth 
non interest expenses grew at a rate of for the year compared to additions to staff to support business development and retail branching contributed to the increase in salaries and employee benefits 
several experienced commercial lenders were hired to support business development efforts related to the reston financial service center  which opened in november  and the warrenton financial service center  which opened in october additionally  various retail staff positions were added to the company s payroll in efforts to prepare for openings of the new facilities 
net occupancy expenses related to our branching efforts also contributed to this increase for because of the company s plans for growth and expansion  it is expected that non interest expense growth rates may exceed this level in the future 
the company remains well capitalized with risk adjusted core capital and total capital ratios well above the regulatory minimums 
asset quality measures also remained consistently strong throughout the year 
the loan loss provision increased primarily due to loan growth 
with the creation of mig  the company has expanded the integration of mtc  mia and the bank s investment services department into a more focused wealth management program for all of the company s clients 
the company intends to make each of its wealth management services available within all of its financial service centers 
also  through the affiliation with stm  the bank plans to continue to increase its loan portfolio by purchasing high credit quality  low loan to value first deeds of trusts on residential property 
the bank plans to continue its focus on low cost deposit growth with advertising campaigns and product development 
management has developed a growth strategy that includes expansion into sterling  virginia loudoun county in other markets under consideration include herndon and chantilly fairfax county 
management will look for key lenders in those markets to join the company s team to generate earning assets and awareness prior to the facility opening 
the company is not aware of any current recommendations by any regulatory authorities that  if they were implemented  would have a material effect on the registrant s liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
recent financial developments three new deposit products were developed and marketed by the bank during the second  third and fourth quarters of the products are high yielding now  savings and money market accounts and were designed both to meet the consumer s demand for higher interest rates and to allow the company to remain competitive with other financial institutions operating within the company s market area 
the company considers the products to be successful in meeting their growth goals and positively contributing to the year s needed deposit growth and reduction in funding costs 
at december   the new products had a collective balance of million and had a weighted average cost of 
renovations were completed on the warrenton financial service center and operations commenced on october  the leased facility is located at blackwell road 
the location is fully staffed and offers traditional banking services  including safe deposit  atm and notary services as well as the full range of the company s other financial services  including investment advisory and trust management the renovations cost approximately million 
in september  the company reevaluated its expansion plans and decided to close its virginia beach loan production office in november the decision was the result of the company s inability to recruit key personnel within that market 
the impact on the company was a cost of  net of tax 
during the second quarter of  the company issued million in brokered certificates of deposit 
at december   million of the brokered certificates remained outstanding 
these brokered certificates of deposits contributed to the increase in total deposits at december  the company had no brokered deposits at december  the company has completed renovations that doubled the size of its purcellville location in order to meet growing demand within the community 
the grand opening of the facility was held on march  the newly remodeled financial service center exemplifies the company s new business model and offers a host of financial services to our clients 
the renovations cost approximately million 
in february  the company entered into a lease for an existing facility in warrenton  virginia 
this opportunity allowed the company to open a facility sooner than was previously anticipated 
the lease has an original term of years  commencing march   and an annual rent of  which will increase three percent per annum on each march st during the original lease term 
the company has four options to renew the lease beyond the initial term  each of which is for a period of five years critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and this section are  to a large degree  dependent upon the accounting policies of the company 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important critical accounting policies to the portrayal and understanding of the bank s financial condition and results of operations 
the critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
allowance for loan losses the bank monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the bank maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of controls over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance they are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
the bank evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due by days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the bank makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas no 
loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of loans losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of the bank as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses is greater than the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses is below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
the bank recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
intangibles and goodwill the company has approximately million in intangible assets and goodwill at december   a decrease of  since december  on april   the company acquired mia  a registered investment advisor  for million 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
in connection with this investment  a purchase price valuation using sfas nos 
and as a guideline was completed to determine the appropriate allocation to identified intangibles 
the valuation concluded that approximately of the purchase price was related to the acquisition of customer relationships with an amortizable life of years 
another of the purchase price was allocated to a non compete agreement with an amortizable life of years 
the remainder of the purchase price has been allocated to goodwill 
approximately million of the million in intangible assets and goodwill at december  is attributable to the company s investment in mtc 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for the life span of various customer relationships as well as the value that key members of management add to the success of the company 
for example  customer attrition rates were determined based upon assumptions that the past five years may predict the future 
if the actual attrition rates  among other assumptions  differed from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require an acceleration in the amortization expense 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
processes and procedures have been identified for the two step process 
when the company completes its ongoing review of the recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill  factors that are considered important to determining whether an impairment might exist include loss of customers acquired or significant withdrawals of the assets currently under management and or early retirement or termination of key members of management 
any changes in the key management estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations

net interest income is the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense of funding those assets 
changes in volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december  this is an increase of over the million reported for the same period in net interest income for increased over the million reported for the increase in net interest income in resulted primarily from the growth in loans  net of deferred costs and allowance for loan losses 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to 
the net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by total average earning assets 
because a portion of interest income earned by the company is nontaxable  the tax equivalent net interest income is considered in the calculation of this ratio 
tax equivalent net interest income is calculated by adding the tax benefit realized from interest income that is nontaxable to total interest income then subtracting total interest expense 
the tax rate utilized in calculating the tax benefit for each of and is 
the reconciliation of tax equivalent net interest income  which is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  to net interest income is reflected in the table below

total interest expense for was million  an increase of million compared to the total interest expense for with the anticipation of rising short term interest rates  continued growth in interest bearing deposits and continued reliance on borrowings to fund the company s asset growth  interest expense is expected to increase 
management expects that the net interest margin will continue to compress during based on conservative internal interest rate risk models and the assumption of a sustained rising rate environment  the company expects net interest income to trend downward slightly throughout the next months as mortgage related assets extend and funding costs continue to rise 
the expected decrease to net interest income could be as little as or  in a month period of rising rates of basis points 
it is anticipated that increased growth in earning assets will help mitigate the above mentioned impact to the company s net interest margin 
the asset liability management committee continues to focus on various strategies to maintain the net interest margin

non performing assets were  at december  non performing assets loans are placed on non accrual status when collection of principal and interest is doubtful  generally when a loan becomes days past due 
there are three negative implications for earnings when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
first  all interest accrued but unpaid at the date that the loan is placed on non accrual status is either deducted from interest income or written off as a loss 
second  accruals of interest are discontinued until it becomes certain that both principal and interest can be repaid 
finally  there may be actual losses that require additional provisions for loan losses be charged against earnings 
for real estate loans  upon foreclosure  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair market value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends  less selling costs 
if a write down of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged off against the allowance for loan losses

the allocation of the allowance as shown in the table above should not be interpreted as an indication that loan losses in future years will occur in the same proportions that they may have in prior years or that the allocation indicates future loan loss trends 
additionally  the proportion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount that may be available for the future losses that could occur within such categories since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the total portfolio

this standard requires classification of investments into three categories  held to maturity htm  available for sale afs  or trading  as further defined in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company does not maintain a trading account and has classified no securities in this category 
htm securities are required to be carried on the financial statements at amortized cost 
afs securities are carried on the financial statements at fair value 
the unrealized gains or losses  net of deferred income taxes  are reflected in shareholders equity 
the htm classification places restrictions on the company s ability to sell securities or to transfer securities into the afs classification 
since the company desires the flexibility to respond to changing balance sheet needs through investment portfolio management  it has chosen to classify only a small portion of its portfolio in this category 
at december   of the portfolio was classified as htm 
the company holds in its loan and securities portfolios investments that adjust or float according to changes in prime lending rate 
these holdings are not considered speculative but instead necessary for good asset liability management 
the carrying value of the securities portfolio was million at december   a decrease of million or from the carrying value of million at december  the market value of the afs securities at december  was million 
the unrealized loss on the afs securities was million at december  this loss was offset by the december  unrealized gain of million 
the net market value loss at december  is reflective of the continued rise in market interest rates 
the net unrealized gain on the afs securities was million at december  since the bank anticipates much of the balance sheet growth to be experienced during  if any  to be in the form of net portfolio loans  specific strategies will be executed during the early part of to maintain the investment portfolio at an amount comparable to the december  balances

deposits deposits continue to be an important funding source and primary supply of the company s growth 
the company s strategy has been to increase its core deposits at the same time that it is controlling its cost of funds 
the maturation of the branch network  as well as increased advertising campaigns and bank mergers  have contributed to the significant growth in deposits over the last several years 
by monitoring interest rates within the local market and that of alternative funding sources  the company is able to price the deposits effectively to develop a core base of deposits in each market

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and interest rate swaps 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the bank has in particular classes of financial instruments 
the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
a summary of the contract amount of the bank s exposure to off balance sheet risk as of december  and  is as follows in thousands financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a client as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the bank evaluates each client s credit worthiness on a case by case basis

the federal reserve board has established minimum regulatory capital standards for bank holding companies and state member banks 
the regulatory capital standards categorize assets and off balance sheet items into four categories that weigh balance sheet assets according to risk  requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets 
the minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets is  of which at least must be tier capital  composed of common equity and retained earnings

while we are currently considered well capitalized  we may from time to time find it necessary to access the capital markets to meet our growth objectives or capitalize on specific business opportunities 
the company s core equity to asset ratio decreased slightly to at december   compared to at december  the decrease is the result of the growth experienced in the bank s total assets and liabilities in relation to its total capital in the primary source of funds for dividends paid by the company to its shareholders is the dividends received from its subsidiaries 
federal regulatory agencies impose certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and the transfer of assets from the banking subsidiaries to the holding company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk  though it should be noted that the assets under management by mtc are affected by equity price risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco of the bank 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies that govern the company s asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated four times during each year 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point bp upward shift and a basis point downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
given the historic low in interest rates for the fiscal year  the model assumed only a basis point decrease in interest rates 
the following reflects the range of the company s net interest income sensitivity analysis during the fiscal years of and as compared to the board approved policy limit 
rate change estimated net interest income sensitivity high low average bp bp rate change estimated net interest income sensitivity high low average bp bp at the end of  the company s interest rate risk model indicated that in a rising rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could decrease by 
for the same time period  the interest rate risk model indicated that  in a declining rate environment of basis points over a month period  net interest income could increase by 
while these numbers are subjective based upon the parameters used within the model  management believes the balance sheet is very balanced with little risk to rising rates in the future 
since december   the company s balance sheet has grown by million 
deposit inflows  increased borrowings from the federal home loan bank and the reduction in the securities portfolio have provided the funding for the growth in the loan portfolios 
overall  the bank continues to have minimal interest rate risks to either falling or rising interest rates 
based upon final simulation  the bank could expect an average negative impact to net interest income of  over the next months if rates rise basis points 
if rates were to decline basis points  the bank could expect an average positive impact to net interest income of  over the next months 
the company maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to minimize significant  unanticipated earnings fluctuations caused by interest rate volatility 
the company s specific goal is to lower where possible the cost of its borrowed funds 
the company enters into interest rate swaps to lock in the interest cash outflows on its floating rate debt 
on december   the company borrowed a  variable rate advance from the federal home loan bank 
on that same date  the company also entered into an interest rate swap with suntrust bank 
the total notional amount of the swap is  this cash flow hedge effectively changes the variable rate interest on the federal home loan bank advance to a fixed rate of interest 
under the terms of the swap which expires december  the company pays suntrust bank a fixed interest rate of 
suntrust bank pays the company a variable rate of interest indexed to the three month libor  plus 
the interest receivable from suntrust bank reprices quarterly 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap designated as a hedging instrument of the variability of cash flows associated with the long term debt are reported in other comprehensive income 
this amount is subsequently reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period in which the related interest on floating rate debt obligation affects earnings 
because there are no differences between the critical terms of the interest rate swap and the hedged debt obligation  the company has determined no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cashflows 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in response to or anticipation of changes in interest rates
