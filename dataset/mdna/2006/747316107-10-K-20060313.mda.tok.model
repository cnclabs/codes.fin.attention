item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary quaker chemical corporation is a worldwide developer  producer  and marketer of chemical specialty products and a provider of chemical management services for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications around the globe  with significant sales to the steel and automotive industries 
the business environment in which the company operates remains challenging as significantly higher raw material and third party finished product costs continue to negatively impact the company s gross margins and the company continues to experience sluggish demand in its us and european markets 
the principal factors impacting earnings included higher raw material costs  a million pre tax charge for restructuring and related activities  and a million tax charge attributable to the repatriation of accumulated earnings of its foreign subsidiaries 
these costs were offset in part by million of pre tax income from the sale of property by the company s real estate joint venture and lower minority interest primarily as a result of the company s first quarter acquisition of the remaining interest in its brazilian affiliate 
in  quaker took action to significantly reduce its base operating costs in the us and europe  which represent more mature markets for the company 
this restructuring included involuntary terminations  a freeze of the company s us pension plan  and a voluntary early retirement offering to eligible us employees  resulting in a net million pre tax charge 
the company believes this restructuring program will allow funding for continued operating expense investments and key growth initiatives 
in addition  assuming a stable raw material cost situation in  this action should allow gross margin improvement from the company s pricing actions to flow to operating income 
the company will maintain its commitment to its globally integrated approach to our business and strategic initiatives 
much of the revenue growth in was a reflection of the pricing actions taken by the company to mitigate higher raw material costs incurred throughout and however  the pace and size of raw material cost increases continue to outpace the company s selling price increases 
limited refining capacity to produce crude oil derivatives continues to impact margins 
also contributing to the gross margin decline was significantly higher third party product purchase costs with respect to the company s cms contracts 
in the fourth quarter of  the company enhanced its capital structure by entering into a million credit facility 
this facility enabled the consolidation of short term debt into a longer term facility and ensured liquidity to support future growth 
additional capital structure measures were taken in the form of substantial repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings 
this action improved the balance between foreign and domestic debt levels  enabled better cash management  improved our global tax position  and lowered our consolidated borrowing costs 
these foreign earnings repatriation actions resulted in a million largely non cash tax charge in the fourth quarter 
in summary  the full year results reflect the challenging business environment in which the company operates and our response to that environment 
continued softness in key markets especially in steel  continued high raw material costs  as well as competitive and contractual constraints limiting pricing actions continue to impact the company s margins 
notwithstanding these limitations  the company was able to recover a substantial portion of the raw material cost increases through selling price increases and renegotiate several of its cms contracts to improve profitability 
in addition  the company also was awarded several new cms contracts which provide for increased price protection 
the company remains focused on pursuing revenue opportunities  managing its raw material and other costs and aggressively pursuing price and cost savings initiatives 
critical accounting policies and estimates quaker s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon quaker s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires quaker to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  quaker evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer sales incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  restructuring  incentive compensation plans  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
quaker bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
quaker believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounts receivable and inventory reserves and exposures quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
further  a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel industry  where a number of bankruptcies have occurred during recent years 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
these matters may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require writedown or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
reserves for customers filing for bankruptcy protection are generally established at of the amount outstanding at the filing date  dependent on the company s evaluation of likely proceeds from the bankruptcy process 
large and or financially distressed customers are generally reserved for on a specific review basis while a general reserve is established for other customers based on historical experience 
the company s consolidated allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
further  the company recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million  million and million in  and respectively 
an increase of to the recorded provisions would have decreased the company s pre tax earnings by million  million and million in  and  respectively 
environmental and litigation reserves accruals for environmental and litigation matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accrued liabilities are exclusive of claims against third parties and are not discounted 
environmental costs and remediation costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of the property from the date acquired or constructed  and or mitigate or prevent contamination in the future 
estimates for accruals for environmental matters are based on a variety of potential technical solutions  governmental regulations and other factors  and are subject to a large range of potential costs for remediation and other actions 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in determining the most likely estimate within the range  and the factors determining this judgment may vary over time 
similarly  reserves for litigation and similar matters are based on a range of potential outcomes and require considerable judgment in determining the most probable outcome 
if no amount within the range is considered more probable than any other amount  the company accrues the lowest amount in the range in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
an inactive subsidiary of the company is involved in asbestos litigation 
if the company ever concludes that it is probable it will be liable for any of the obligations of such subsidiary  then it will record the associated liabilities if they can be reasonably estimated 
the company will reassess this situation periodically in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report 
realizability of equity investments quaker holds equity investments in various foreign companies  whereby it has the ability to influence  but not control  the operations of the entity and its future results 
quaker records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions  poor operating results of underlying investments  or devaluation of foreign currencies could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value 
these factors may result in an impairment charge in the future 
the carrying amount of the company s equity investments at december  was million and was comprised of three investments totaling  and million  respectively 
tax exposures and valuation allowances quaker records expenses and liabilities for taxes based on estimates of amounts that will be ultimately determined to be deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions 
the filed tax returns are subject to audit  often several years subsequent to the date of the financial statements 
disputes or disagreements may arise during audits over the timing or validity of certain items or deductions  which may not be resolved for extended periods of time 
quaker establishes reserves for potential tax audit and other exposures as transactions occur and reviews these reserves on a regular basis  however  actual exposures and audit adjustments may vary from these estimates 
quaker also records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while quaker has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event quaker were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should quaker determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
us income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries since it is the company s intention to continue to reinvest these earnings in those subsidiaries for working capital needs and growth initiatives 
us and foreign income taxes that would be payable if such earnings were distributed may be lower than the amount computed at the us statutory rate due to the availability of tax credits 
restructuring liabilities restructuring charges may consist of charges for employee severance  rationalization of manufacturing facilities and other items 
in  quaker recorded restructuring and other exit costs  including involuntary termination of certain employees  in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
certain of these items  particularly those involving impairment charges for assets to be sold or closed  require significant estimates and assumptions in terms of estimated sale proceeds  date of sale  transaction costs and other matters  and these estimates can change based on market conditions and other factors 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullified eitf issue no 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for exit costs is recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets  which do not have indefinite lives  are recorded at fair value and amortized over a straight line basis based on third party valuations of the assets 
goodwill and intangible assets  which have indefinite lives  are no longer amortized and are required to be assessed at least annually for impairment 
the company compares the assets fair value to their carrying value primarily based on future discounted cash flows in order to determine if an impairment charge is warranted 
the estimates of future cash flows involve considerable management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance 
assumptions used in these forecasts are consistent with internal planning 
the actual cash flows could differ from management s estimates due to changes in business conditions  operating performance  and economic conditions 
the company completed its annual impairment assessment as of the end of the third quarter  and no impairment charge was warranted 
the company s consolidated goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the company s assumption of weighted average cost of capital and estimated future net operating profit after tax nopat are particularly important in determining whether an impairment charge has been incurred 
the company currently uses a weighted average cost of capital of and  at september   this assumption would have had to increase by more than percentage points before any of the company s reporting units would fail step one of the sfas no 
impairment analysis 
further  at september   the company s estimate of future nopat would have had to decrease by more than before any of the company s reporting units would be considered potentially impaired 
postretirement benefits the company provides certain pension and other postretirement benefits to employees and retirees 
independent actuaries  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  perform the required valuations to determine benefit expense and  if necessary  non cash charges to equity for additional minimum pension liabilities 
critical assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rates of return on assets 
if different assumptions were used  additional pension expense or charges to equity might be required 
for  the company incurred such a non cash charge to equity of million 
the company s pension plan year end is november  which serves as the measurement date

 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles unless it is impracticable to determine either period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change or  in the unusual instance  that a newly issued accounting pronouncement does not include explicit transition provisions 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company will apply the requirements of the standard as needed 
in december  the fasb issued its final standard on accounting for share based payments  sfas r revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other similar awards 
the fair value of the awards are to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the cost to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
sfas r eliminates the alternative use of accounting principles board no 
s intrinsic value method of accounting for awards  which is the company s current accounting policy for stock options 
see note for the pro forma impact of compensation expense from stock options on net earnings and earnings per share 
sfas r is effective for the company beginning january  the company adopted the provisions of sfas r on a prospective basis 
the financial statement impact will be dependent on future stock based awards and any unvested stock options outstanding 
at the time of adoption  the company will have approximately million of pre tax expense to record related to unvested stock options 
in december  the fasb issued its final standard on accounting for exchanges on nonmonetary assets  sfas  exchange of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas requires that exchanges of nonmonetary assets be measured based on the fair value of assets exchanged for annual periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb  chapter sfas 
sfas clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage in the determination of inventory carrying costs 
the statement requires that such costs be recognized as a current period expense 
sfas also requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after july  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources quaker s cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease was primarily from million cash provided by operating activities  offset by million cash used in investing activities and million cash used in financing activities 
net cash flow provided by operating activities was million in versus million in the company s lower net income was more than offset by significant improvements in the company s working capital accounts as compared to the improvements in working capital accounts were driven by a significant increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the largest gains in accounts payable occurred due to the timing of payments in north america and europe 
the change in estimated taxes on income was due to a million overpaid tax position at the end of relating to our european operations  which was realized in net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in the increased use of cash was primarily due to payments related to an acquisition  offset in part by proceeds from the disposition of partnership assets and lower capital expenditures 
in march  the company acquired the remaining interest in its brazilian joint venture for million 
the company recorded a gain of million in the first quarter of in connection with the sale of real estate assets by the company s real estate joint venture 
the decrease in capital expenditures was due to lower spending on the company s us lab renovation and global erp implementation 
the company also received million of cash proceeds in from the sale of its villeneuve  france site 
in  the company received million of cash proceeds primarily from the sale of real estate by the company s majority owned australian subsidiary 
in january  the company contributed its conshohocken  pennsylvania property and buildings the site into a real estate joint venture the venture in exchange for a interest in the venture 
the venture did not assume any debt or other obligations of the company and the company did not guarantee nor was it obligated to pay any principal  interest or penalties on any of the venture s indebtedness 
the venture renovated certain of the existing buildings at the site  as well as built new office space 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with the venture to lease approximately of the site s available office space for a year period commencing february  with multiple renewal options 
the company believes the terms of this lease were no less favorable than the terms it would have obtained from an unaffiliated third party 
in february  the venture sold its real estate assets to an unrelated third party  which resulted in million of proceeds to the company after payment of the venture s obligations 
the proceeds include a gain of million related to the sale by the venture of its real estate holdings as well as million of preferred distributions 
net cash flows used in financing activities was million in versus million of cash provided by financing activities in net repayments of debt of million in versus million of net borrowings of debt in primarily drove the change in cash flows from financing activities 
the net borrowings in were primarily used to fund the company s working capital needs as compared to in addition  higher distributions paid to minority shareholders of certain of the company s affiliates contributed to the current year use of cash 
the increase in distributions to minority shareholders was driven in large part by a distribution made prior to the company s acquisition of the remaining interest in its brazilian joint venture described above 
throughout  the company maintained various short term credit facilities with multiple banks 
at december   the company s short term credit facilities totaled million of which million was committed and million was uncommitted 
in september  the company prepaid its senior unsecured notes due in the total amount of principal prepaid was million 
in october  the company entered into a new syndicated multi currency credit agreement that provides for financing in the united states and the netherlands 
this facility enabled the company to consolidate the majority of its short term debt into a longer term facility 
the new facility terminates on september  the new facility allows for revolving credit borrowings in a principal amount of up to million  which can be increased to million at the company s option if lenders agree to increase their commitments and the company satisfies certain conditions 
in general  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either a base rate or libor rate plus a margin based on the company s consolidated leverage ratio 
the provisions of the agreements require that the company maintain certain financial ratios and covenants  all of which the company was in compliance with as of december  and under its most restrictive covenants  the company could have borrowed an additional million at december  at december  and  the company had approximately million and million outstanding on these credit lines at a weighted average borrowing rate of and  respectively 
the company believes that  in  it is capable of supporting its operating requirements including pension plan contributions  payments of dividends to shareholders  possible acquisition opportunities  and possible resolution of contingencies  through internally generated funds supplemented with debt as needed 
in december  an inactive subsidiary of the company reached a settlement agreement and release with one of its insurance carriers for million 
the proceeds of the settlement are restricted and can only be used to pay claims and costs of defense associated with this subsidiary s asbestos litigation 
the subsidiary received million in december  which was deposited into an interest bearing account  and will receive an additional million in december unless federal asbestos legislation is adopted 
both the subsidiary and the insurance company acknowledge that as of the effective date of the settlement agreement and release it appears unlikely that federal asbestos legislation will be enacted into law prior to the scheduled december payment 
however  if the president of the united states signs into law the federal asbestos legislation  the insurance carrier s obligation to make the second payment will be cancelled 
the restrictions regarding the use of proceeds lapse after a period of years 
due to the restricted nature of the proceeds  a corresponding deferred credit was established in other non current liabilities for an equal and offsetting amount  and will remain until the restrictions lapse or the funds are exhausted via payments of claims and costs of defense 
see also notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
pension and other postretirement plan contributions beyond are not determinable since the amount of any contribution is heavily dependent on the future economic environment and investment returns on pension trust assets 
the timing of payments related to other long term liabilities  which consist primarily of deferred compensation agreements  cannot be readily determined due to their uncertainty 
interest obligations on the company s short and long term debt are excluded as the majority of the company s debt is subject to variable interest rates 
amounts in millions payments due by period contractual obligations total and beyond short term debt long term debt capital lease obligations non cancelable operating leases purchase obligations pension and other postretirement plan contributions other long term liabilities primarily deferred compensation agreements total contractual cash obligations operations cms discussion during  the company began a new approach to its chemical management services cms business consistent with the company s strategic imperative to sell customer solutions value not just fluids 
under the company s traditional cms approach  the company effectively acts as an agent whereby it purchases chemicals from other companies and resells the product to the customer at little or no margin and earns a set management fee for providing this service 
therefore  the profit earned on the management fee is relatively secure as the entire cost of the products is passed on to the customer 
the new approach to cms is dramatically different 
the company receives a set management fee and the costs that relate to those management fees are largely connected to how well the company controls product costs and achieves product conversions from other third party suppliers to its own products 
with this new approach come new risks and opportunities  as the profit earned from the management fee is subject to movements in product costs as well as the company s own performance 
the company believes this new approach is a way for quaker to become an integral part of our customers operational efforts to improve manufacturing costs and to demonstrate value that the company would not be able to demonstrate as purely a product provider 
with this new approach  the company was awarded a series of multi year cms contracts primarily at general motors powertrain and daimlerchrysler manufacturing sites in  and this business was an important step in building the company s share and leadership position in the automotive process fluids market and should position the company well for penetration of cms opportunities in other metalworking manufacturing sites 
this new approach has also had a dramatic impact on the company s revenue and margins 
under the traditional cms approach  where the company effectively acts as an agent  the revenue and costs from these sales are reported on a net sales or pass through basis 
as discussed above  the structure of the new cms approach is different in that the company s revenue received from the customer is a fee for products and services provided to the customer  which are indirectly related to the actual costs incurred 
as a result  the company recognizes in reported revenues the gross revenue received from the cms site customer  and in cost of goods sold  the third party product purchases  which substantially offset each other until the company achieves significant product conversions 
there are two critical success factors for this new approach 
first  is to create savings for a customer based on our ability to help apply the product better and improve the customer s own processes 
second  is to convert more of the product being used to quaker product rather than a competitor s product 
while the company s us cms program contributed to profitability in  overall performance was tempered by higher third party product costs 
comparison of with net sales for increased to million  up from million for approximately of the sales increase was attributable to higher sales prices  while foreign exchange rate translation favorably impacted net sales by approximately 
volume increases in asia pacific were offset by softer demand in north america and europe 
gross profit net sales less cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales declined from in to in higher prices for the company s raw materials  particularly crude oil derivatives  and higher third party product purchase costs with respect to the company s cms contracts  exceeded the pace at which price increases could be implemented through the year 
unfavorable product and regional mix also contributed to the decline in gross profit percentage 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for increased million or approximately from foreign exchange rate translation accounted for approximately half of the increase with the remainder attributable to inflation  investments in growth initiatives and higher pension costs offset by other cost reduction efforts 
sg a as a percentage of sales decreased from to 
in the first quarter of  the company incurred a net pre tax charge of million related to a reduction in its workforce 
during the fourth quarter of  the company furthered this restructuring effort with the goal of significantly reducing operating costs in the us and europe 
the fourth quarter program included involuntary terminations  a freeze of the company s us pension plan  and a voluntary early retirement offering to eligible us employees 
these actions resulted in a net pre tax charge of million 
the company estimates savings resulting from these programs to be of a similar magnitude as the charges 
these savings will substantially mitigate the increased cost of continued operating expense investments and key growth initiatives 
the increase in other income for was largely due to the million of proceeds received from the sale by the company s real estate joint venture of its holdings as previously announced on february  the proceeds included a million gain relating to the sale by the venture of its real estate holdings  as well as million of preferred return distributions 
preferred distributions in totaled million 
foreign exchange gains in also contributed to the increase in other income 
the increase in net interest expense in was due to higher average borrowings and higher interest rates on the company s debt 
the effective tax rate was versus in the increase was primarily due to the company s election  in the fourth quarter of  to repatriate substantial accumulated foreign earnings which  primarily to improve its global capital structure  resulted in a million charge in tax expense 
at the end of  the company had net us deferred tax assets totaling million  excluding deferred tax assets relating to additional minimum pension liabilities 
the company records valuation allowances when necessary to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
however  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its us net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be a non cash charge to income in the period such determination were made  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
the continued upward pressure in the company s crude oil based raw materials has outpaced the company s selling price increases  negatively impacting us profitability 
the company continues to closely monitor this situation as it relates to its net deferred tax assets and the assessment of valuation allowances 
the company is continuing to evaluate alternatives that could positively impact us taxable income 
the million decrease in minority interest in was primarily due to the company s first quarter acquisition of the remaining interest in its brazilian affiliate 
segment reviews comparison of with metalworking process chemicals metalworking process chemicals consists of industrial process fluids for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications and represented approximately of the company s net sales in net sales were up million  or  compared with favorable currency translation represented approximately percentage points of the growth in this segment  driven by the brazilian real to us dollar exchange rate 
the average brazilian real to us dollar rate was in compared to in the remaining net sales increase of was due to growth in asia pacific  growth in south america  growth in north america  partially offset by decreases in our european net sales  which were down  all on a constant currency basis 
the growth in net sales is primarily attributable to the pricing actions taken by the company throughout and to help in offsetting the continued escalation in raw material costs 
volume increases in asia pacific were offset by volume declines in the company s north american and european regions 
the million decrease in this segment s operating income compared to is largely reflective of the pace at which raw material costs have escalated beyond the company s pricing actions 
this segment s operating income was also impacted by higher selling costs compared to the prior year 
coatings the company s coatings segment  which represented approximately of company s net sales for  contains products that provide temporary and permanent coatings for metal and concrete products and chemical milling maskants 
net sales for this segment were up million  or in  compared with the prior year  primarily due to higher chemical milling maskant sales to the aerospace industry 
operating income decreased by million in compared to due to higher raw material and selling costs 
other chemical products other chemical products  which represented approximately of net sales in  consists of sulfur removal products for industrial gas streams sold by the company s q technologies joint venture 
net sales for decreased million or due to a variety of market conditions  including special one time sales to this segment s largest customer in affecting the yearly net sales comparison 
this segment s operating income decreased by million  consistent with the noted volume decreases and higher raw material costs 
comparison of with consolidated net sales increased by to million in from million in the impact from foreign exchange rate translation increased sales by approximately million  or 
the timing of the company s acquisitions increased net sales by million  or  and the company s new chemical management services cms contracts  increased net sales by million  or 
the remaining increase in net sales was attributable to growth in the asia pacific and north and south american regions partially offset by lower sales in europe 
the decline in business in europe was substantially caused by softness in sheet steel demand 
although the company s market share in this region remained stable during  the increased competitive pressures experienced in late also affected the yearly comparisons 
gross profit net sales less cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales declined from in to in the new cms contracts resulted in an increase in the company s reported revenue of approximately million and a corresponding decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales of approximately percentage points 
the remaining decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales was primarily due to increased raw material costs  as well as unfavorable product and geographic mix 
even though the company experienced a four year high in the pricing of its key raw material markets at the end of  the pricing of these key raw materials continued to escalate in while the company benefited from the implementation of price increases announced during the third and fourth quarters of  these gains were more than offset by the continued increase in raw material prices  particularly crude oil based derivatives 
sg a as reported for totaled million compared to million in approximately of the million increase was due to foreign exchange rate translation and the company s acquisition activity  which impacted sg a by approximately million and million  respectively 
the majority of the remaining increase was due to costs associated with strategic initiatives  as well as a range of administrative costs such as sarbanes oxley compliance  pension  incentive compensation  and higher sales commissions 
the company s strategic initiatives include expanding our presence in the asia pacific region  further supporting our cms business  the continued rollout of our global erp system  and continuing development of new  complementary businesses 
during the fourth quarter of  the company began efforts to realign its organization and reduce costs by announcing the consolidation of its administrative facilities in hong kong with its shanghai headquarters  resulting in a million pre tax charge for restructuring and related activities 
the increase in other income in reflected a gain on the sale of real estate by the company s majority owned australian subsidiary  as well as higher priority return distributions from the company s real estate joint venture in conshohocken 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to higher debt balances outstanding during as well as higher short term interest rates on the company s credit facilities 
the company s effective tax rate was in and in the effective tax rate is dependent on many internal and external factors and is assessed by the company on a regular basis 
the million increase in minority interest expense in was primarily due to the gain on the sale of real estate relating to the company s australian operations mentioned above as well as a stronger performance from the company s brazilian joint venture 
segment reviews comparison of with metalworking process chemicals metalworking process chemicals  which consists of industrial process fluids for various heavy industrial and manufacturing applications  represented approximately of the company s sales in reported revenues in this segment were up approximately compared with the company s new cms contracts accounted for approximately percentage points of the revenue growth in this segment 
the timing of the company s acquisitions of vulcan  eural  and ks chemie accounted for approximately percentage points of the revenue growth in this segment 
currency translation increased sales by percentage points  primarily due to the higher average euro to us dollar exchange rate of in compared to in the remaining net sales increase of was primarily due to growth in south america  growth in asia pacific  and increase in the us base business  offset by decreases in our european sales  which was down  all on a constant currency basis 
the operating income in this segment increased by million or 
the disparity between the increase in sales and operating income is largely reflective of the company s new approach to its cms business  discussed above 
further  this segment s operating income was negatively impacted by significantly higher raw material costs  unfavorable product and regional sales mix as well as higher selling costs 
coatings the company s coatings segment represented approximately of the company s sales in and contained products that provide temporary and permanent coatings for metal and concrete products and chemical milling maskants 
revenues for this segment were up approximately million or for compared with the prior year primarily due to higher chemical milling maskant sales to the aerospace industry  as well as new customer penetration in roofing sealants 
operating income increased million over  consistent with the noted volume increases 
other chemical products other chemical products represents approximately of total sales in and consists of sulfur removal products for industrial gas streams sold by the company s q technologies joint venture 
sales for increased million primarily due to special one time sales to this segment s largest customer 
operating income increased by million over the prior year  due to the noted volume increases offset by higher raw material costs 
restructuring and related activities in  quaker s management approved restructuring plans to realign the organization primarily in europe and reduce operating costs program 
quaker s restructuring plans included the closing and sale of its manufacturing facilities in the uk and france 
in addition  quaker consolidated certain functions within its global business units and reduced administrative functions  as well as expensed costs related to abandoned acquisitions

these statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations about future events 
these forward looking statements include statements with respect to our beliefs  plans  objectives  goals  expectations  anticipations  intentions  financial condition  results of operations  future performance and business  including statements relating to our business strategy  our current and future results and plans  and statements that include the words may  could  should  would  believe  expect  anticipate  estimate  intend  plan or similar expressions 
such statements include information relating to current and future business activities  operational matters  capital spending  and financing sources 
from time to time  oral or written forward looking statements are also included in quaker s periodic reports on forms q and k  press releases and other materials released to the public 
any or all of the forward looking statements in this report  in quaker s annual report to shareholders for and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong 
this can occur as a result of inaccurate assumptions or as a consequence of known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
many factors discussed in this report will be important in determining our future performance 
consequently  actual results may differ materially from those that might be anticipated from our forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
however  any further disclosures made on related subjects in quaker s subsequent reports on forms k  q and k should be consulted 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions about us and our operations that are subject to change based on various important factors  some of which are beyond our control 
a major risk is that the company s demand is largely derived from the demand for its customers products  which subjects the company to uncertainties related to downturns in a customer s business and unanticipated customer production shutdowns 
other major risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  significant increases in raw material costs  worldwide economic and political conditions  foreign currency fluctuations  and terrorist attacks such as those that occurred on september   each of which is discussed in greater detail in item a of this report 
furthermore  the company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by steel  automobile  aircraft  appliance  and durable goods manufacturers 
these risks  uncertainties  and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
other factors beyond those discussed in this report could also adversely affect us 
therefore  we caution you not to place undue reliance on our forward looking statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quaker is exposed to the impact of interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations  changes in commodity prices  and credit risk 
interest rate risk 
quaker s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short and long term debt 
most of quaker s debt is negotiated at market rates 
accordingly  if interest rates rise significantly  the cost of debt to quaker will increase 
this can have an adverse effect on quaker  depending on the extent of quaker s borrowings 
as of december   quaker had approximately million in borrowings under its credit facilities at a weighted average borrowing rate of approximately 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into three interest rate swaps in order to fix a portion of its variable rate debt 
the combined notional value of the swaps was million and had a fair value of million at december  see information included in the caption derivatives of note of notes to consolidated financial statements which appears in item of this report and is incorporated herein by reference 
foreign exchange risk 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues and earnings is generated by its foreign operations 
these foreign operations also hold a significant portion of quaker s assets and liabilities 
all such operations use the local currency as their functional currency 
accordingly  quaker s financial results are affected by risks typical of global business such as currency fluctuations  particularly between the us dollar  the brazilian real  and the eu euro 
as exchange rates vary  quaker s results can be materially affected 
the company generally does not use financial instruments that expose it to significant risk involving foreign currency transactions  however  the size of non us activities has a significant impact on reported operating results and the attendant net assets 
during the past three years  sales by non us subsidiaries accounted for approximately to of consolidated net annual sales 
in addition  the company often sources inventory among its worldwide operations 
this practice can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from the varying cost of inventory to the receiving location as well as from the revaluation of intercompany balances 
the company mitigates this risk through local sourcing efforts 
commodity price risk 
many of the raw materials used by quaker are commodity chemicals  and  therefore  quaker s earnings can be materially affected by market changes in raw material prices 
in certain cases  quaker has entered into fixed price purchase contracts having a term of up to one year 
these contracts provide for protection to quaker if the price for the contracted raw materials rises  however  in certain limited circumstances  quaker will not realize the benefit if such prices decline 
credit risk 
quaker establishes allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of quaker s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
downturns in the overall economic climate may also exacerbate specific customer financial issues 
a significant portion of quaker s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the us steel industry  where a number of bankruptcies occurred during recent years 
through  quaker recorded additional provisions for doubtful accounts primarily related to bankruptcies in the us steel industry 
in addition  in the third quarter of  the company recorded additional provisions for doubtful accounts in connection with a customer bankruptcy 
when a bankruptcy occurs  quaker must judge the amount of proceeds  if any  that may ultimately be received through the bankruptcy or liquidation process 
in addition  as part of its terms of trade  quaker may custom manufacture products for certain large customers and or may ship product on a consignment basis 
these practices may increase the company s exposure should a bankruptcy occur  and may require writedown or disposal of certain inventory due to its estimated obsolescence or limited marketability 
customer returns of products or disputes may also result in similar issues related to the realizability of recorded accounts receivable or returned inventory
