item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s overview new jersey resources corporation njr or the company is an energy services holding company providing retail natural gas service in new jersey and wholesale natural gas and related energy services to customers in states from the gulf coast and mid continent to new england and canada through its two principal subsidiaries  new jersey natural gas njng and njr energy services njres 
njng is a natural gas utility which provides regulated retail natural gas service in central and northern new jersey and also participates in the off system sales and capacity release markets  and comprises the natural gas distribution segment 
njng is regulated by the new jersey board of public utilities bpu 
njres maintains and trades around a portfolio of physical assets consisting of natural gas storage and transportation contracts 
as well  njres provides wholesale energy services to non affiliated utility and energy companies 
njres comprises the energy services segment 
the retail and other segment includes njr home services njrhs  which provides service  sales and installation of appliances  njr energy  an investor in energy related ventures  most significantly  through njnr pipeline it holds the company s percent interest in iroquois gas and transmission system  lp iroquois  which is a mile natural gas pipeline from the new york canadian border to long island  new york  commercial realty and resources cr r  which holds and develops commercial real estate  and njr investment  which makes energy related equity investments 
net income and assets by business segment are as follows in thousands net income natural gas distribution energy services retail and other total in thousands assets natural gas distribution energy services retail and other total natural gas distribution segment natural gas distribution operations have been managed with the goal of growing profitably without the need for traditional base rate increases 
njng  working together with the bpu and the new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued new jersey department of the public advocate  division of rate counsel formerly called the division of the ratepayer advocate  has been able to accomplish this goal for more than years through several key initiatives including managing its customer growth  which is expected to total about percent annually  generating earnings from various bpu authorized gross margin sharing incentive programs  which are currently approved through october   reducing the impact of weather on njng s earnings through a weather normalization clause wnc  managing the volatility of wholesale natural gas prices through a hedging program to help keep customers prices as stable as possible  and improving its cost structure through various productivity initiatives 
in conducting njng s business  management focuses on factors it believes may have significant influence on its future financial results 
njng s policy is to work with all stakeholders  including customers  regulators and policymakers  to achieve favorable results 
these factors include the rate of njng s customer growth in its service territory  which can be influenced by general economic conditions as well as political and regulatory policies that may impact the new housing market 
a portion of njng s customer growth comes from the conversion market  which is influenced by the delivered cost of natural gas compared with competing fuels  interest rates and other economic conditions 
for the reporting periods through september   the impact of weather on njng s utility gross margin had been significantly mitigated due to its wnc  however  lower customer usage per degree day was not captured by the wnc 
njng has experienced lower customer usage per degree day  which it believes is due primarily to customer conservation resulting from an increase in wholesale natural gas commodity costs 
in order to reduce the impact of the reduction in customer usage  njng filed a conservation and usage adjustment cua proposal with the bpu in december on october   the bpu approved a stipulation that was reached with the staff of the bpu and the division of rate counsel on september   which modified the cua proposal into the conservation incentive program cip 
the cip is a three year pilot program  designed to decouple the link between customer usage and njng s utility gross margin to allow njng to encourage its customers to conserve energy 
for the term of the pilot the existing wnc would be suspended and replaced with the cip tracking mechanism  which addresses utility gross margin variations related to both weather and customer usage in comparison to established benchmarks 
recovery of such utility gross margin variations is subject to additional conditions including an earnings test and an evaluation of basic gas supply service bgss related savings achieved 
under the cip agreement  if njng does not file for a rate review with the bpu within two years  the return on equity for the earnings test will decline from percent to percent 
to encourage energy efficiency  njng is also required to initiate programs to further customer conservation efforts over the term of the pilot 
njng shall provide an initial new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued million in funding for such programs and will continue to fund programs throughout the term of the pilot 
at september   the obligation to fund these conservation programs was recorded at its present value of million and recognized as a component of operating and maintenance expense in the consolidated statements of income 
an annual filing for the clause must be made in june of each year  coincident with njng s annual bgss filing 
njng s operating expenses are heavily influenced by labor costs  large components of which are covered by a negotiated collective bargaining agreement that expires in labor related fringe benefit costs  which are also subject to numerous factors  may also influence njng s results 
as a regulated company  njng is required to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on its financial statements 
as a result  significant costs are deferred and treated as regulatory assets  pending bpu decisions regarding their ultimate recovery from customers 
the most significant costs incurred that are subject to this accounting treatment include manufactured gas plant mgp remediation costs and wholesale natural gas costs 
actual remediation costs may vary from management s estimates due to the developing nature of remediation requirements and related litigation 
if there are changes in the regulatory position on the recovery of these costs  such costs would be charged to income 
due to the capital intensive nature of njng s operations and the seasonal nature of its working capital requirements  significant changes in interest rates can also impact njng s results 
energy services segment the energy services segment is focused on maximizing physical asset values that it controls through the use of contractual rights  which allows njres to take advantage of differences in pricing across geographic regions and or time periods 
njres also seeks to utilize its marketplace knowledge in capacity and supply contract management for other utilities and energy companies 
the energy services segment focuses on providing wholesale energy services  including base load natural gas services  peaking services and balancing services  utilizing physical assets it controls  as well as natural gas management services to third parties 
njres contribution to earnings has increased over the past several years due primarily to increases in its portfolio of pipeline and storage capacity and the volatile nature of wholesale natural gas prices 
the volatile nature of wholesale natural gas prices over short periods of time can significantly impact njres revenue and gross margin 
furthermore  gross margin for njres is generally greater during the winter months  while the fixed costs of its capacity assets are generally spread throughout the year 
future growth is expected to come from opportunities that include the acquisition of additional storage and pipeline capacity assets and portfolio management services for third parties 
retail and other segment in the retail and other segment  njrhs is focused on growing its installation business and expanding its service contract customer base 
cr r seeks additional opportunities to enhance the value of its undeveloped land 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
application of these accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingencies during the reporting period 
the company regularly evaluates its estimates  including those related to the calculation of the fair value of natural gas commodity contracts and derivative instruments  unbilled revenues  provisions for depreciation and amortization  regulatory assets  income taxes  pension and postemployment benefits other than pensions and contingencies related to environmental matters and litigation 
njr bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
in the normal course of business  estimated amounts are subsequently adjusted to actual results that may differ from estimates 
regulatory accounting njng maintains its accounts in accordance with the uniform system of accounts as prescribed by the bpu 
as a result of the ratemaking process  njng is required to follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas  and consequently  the accounting principles applied by njng differ in certain respects from those applied by unregulated businesses 
njng is required under sfas to recognize the impact of regulatory decisions on its financial statements 
njng s bgss requires njng to project its natural gas costs and provides the ability  subject to bpu approval  to recover or refund the difference  if any  of such actual costs as compared with the projected costs included in prices through a bgss charge to customers 
any underrecovery or overrecovery is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets and reflected in the bgss charge to customers in subsequent years 
njng also enters into derivatives that are used to hedge natural gas purchases  and the offset to the resulting fair value of derivative assets or liabilities is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the bgss  other regulatory assets consist primarily of remediation costs associated with mgp sites  the wnc  the new jersey clean energy program and the universal service fund program  all of which are subject to bpu approval 
if there are changes in future regulatory positions that indicate the recovery of such regulatory assets is not probable  the related cost and carrying costs would be charged to income in the period of such determination 
derivatives derivative activities are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas  under which njr records the fair value of derivatives held as assets and liabilities 
njr s unregulated subsidiaries record changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of common stock equity 
under sfas  njr also has new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued certain derivative instruments that do not qualify as hedges 
the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded in gas purchases on the consolidated statements of income 
in addition  the changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting are recorded as increases or decreases in natural gas costs or interest expense  as applicable  based on the nature of the derivatives 
njng s derivatives that are used to hedge its natural gas purchasing activities are recoverable through its bgss  subject to bpu approval 
accordingly  the offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
njr has not designated any derivatives as fair value hedges as of september  and in providing its unregulated wholesale energy services  njres enters into physical contracts to buy and sell natural gas 
these contracts qualify for the normal purchase normal sale scope exception under sfas in that they provide for the purchase or sale of natural gas that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or sold by njres over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
accordingly  njres accounts for these contracts under accrual accounting 
the fair value of derivative investments is determined by reference to quoted market prices of listed contracts  published quotations or quotations from independent parties 
njres trading portfolio is valued using a combination of proprietary modeling methods and the most currently available market pricing and data 
should there be a significant change in model assumptions  or in the underlying market prices or data  or should certain contracts fail to meet the normal purchase normal sale scope exception of sfas  njres may experience a significant impact on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
environmental costs at the end of each fiscal year  njng updates the environmental review of its mgp sites  including a review of its potential liability for investigation and remedial action  based on assistance from an outside consulting firm 
from this review  njng estimates expenditures to remediate and monitor these mgp sites  exclusive of any insurance recoveries 
njng s estimate of these liabilities is developed from then currently available facts  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations 
where the information is sufficient to establish only a range of probable liability  and no point within the range is more likely than any other  it is njng s policy to accrue the lower end of the range 
since management believes that recovery of these expenditures  as well as related litigation costs  is probable through the regulatory process  in accordance with sfas  it has recorded a regulatory asset corresponding to the accrued liability 
the actual costs to be incurred by njng are dependent upon several factors  including final determination of remedial action  changing technologies and governmental regulations  the ultimate ability of other responsible parties to pay  the impact of litigation and any insurance recoveries 
if there are changes in future regulatory positions that indicate the recovery of all or a portion of such new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued regulatory asset is not probable  the related cost and carrying costs would be charged to income in the period of such determination 
as of september  and  million and million of previously incurred remediation costs  net of recoveries from customers and insurance proceeds received and anticipated  is included in regulatory assets on the consolidated balance sheet  respectively 
if there are changes in the regulatory position surrounding these costs  or should actual expenditures vary significantly from estimates in that these costs are disallowed for recovery by the bpu  such costs would be charged to income in the period of such determination 
postemployment employee benefits njr s costs of providing postemployment employee benefits are dependent upon numerous factors including actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
postemployment employee benefit costs  for example  are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plans and the return on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future postemployment employee benefit costs 
postemployment employee benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  health care cost trends and discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligations pbo 
in determining the pbo and cost amounts  assumptions can change from period to period and could result in material changes to net postemployment employee benefit periodic costs and the related liability recognized by njr 
njr s postemployment employee benefit plan assets consist primarily of us equity securities  international equity securities and fixed income investments  with a targeted allocation of percent  percent and percent  respectively 
fluctuations in actual market returns  as well as changes in interest rates  may result in increased or decreased postemployment employee benefit costs in future periods 
postemployment employee benefit expenses are included in operations and maintenance expense on the consolidated statements of income

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which alters the framework for recognizing income tax contingencies 
previously  under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  the focus was on the subsequent liability recognition for estimated losses from tax contingencies where such losses were probable and the related amounts could be reasonably estimated 
under this new interpretation  a contingent tax asset ie  an uncertain tax position may only be recognized if it is more likely than not that it will ultimately be sustained upon audit 
the company will adopt fin by the commencement of fiscal the company is evaluating its tax positions for all jurisdictions and all years for which the statute of limitations remains open  as well as evaluating the impact that the adoption will have on its financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value as the amount that would be exchanged to sell an asset or transfer a liability  in an orderly transaction between market participants  and establishes a fair value hierarchy of quotes and unobservable data that should be used to develop pricing assumptions 
in addition  for assets and liabilities that are not actively traded  for example  certain kinds of derivatives  sfas requires that a fair value measurement include an adjustment for risks inherent in a valuation technique and or inputs  such as those used in pricing models 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   however  early adoption is permitted 
the company will adopt the provisions of the statement prospectively and is evaluating the adoption date and its effect on its financial condition 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postemployment plans sfas 
the statement requires an employer to recognize the funded status  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation  of its benefit plans 
sfas does not change how pensions and other postemployment benefits are accounted for and reported in the income statement 
certain economic events  which previously required disclosure only in the notes to the financial statements  will be recognized as assets and liabilities and offset in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  on the statement of common stock equity to the extent such amounts are not recognized in earnings as part of net periodic benefit costs 
amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income are adjusted as they are subsequently recognized in earnings 
the company will adopt sfas on september  and will apply the provisions of the statement prospectively 
the company is currently evaluating the effect of adoption on its financial condition 
results of operations consolidated net income increased percent to million in fiscal  percent to million in fiscal and percent to million in fiscal the fiscal results were per basic share and per diluted share  compared with the fiscal results of per basic share and per diluted share 
fiscal results included a gain of 
per basic share 
per diluted share on the sale of a commercial office building  a charge of 
per basic and diluted share associated with an early retirement program for officers and a charge of 
per basic and diluted share due to a change in strategy at cr r 
net of these items  njr s earnings in fiscal were million  or per basic share and per diluted share 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued following is a reconciliation of as reported and as adjusted information for net income and basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal this reconciliation reflects the impact of the gain on sale of the commercial office building  the charge related to an early retirement program for officers and the charge for the impairment of certain undeveloped land 
management believes that this reconciliation is needed due to the unusual nature of these items and that they are not indicative of core results 
it also provides a more consistent comparison for year over year results unaudited thousands  except per share data for twelve months ended september  njng njres njrhs and other total net income  as reported exclude gain on sale of commercial office building  net of tax charge for early retirement program  net of tax charge for impairment of undeveloped land  net of tax net income  as adjusted earnings per share basic  as reported exclude gain on sale of commercial office building  net of tax charge for early retirement program  net of tax charge for impairment of undeveloped land  net of tax earnings per share basic  as adjusted earnings per share diluted  as reported exclude gain on sale of commercial office building  net of tax charge for early retirement program  net of tax charge for impairment of undeveloped land  net of tax earnings per share diluted  as adjusted amount does not sum due to rounding of individual components natural gas distribution operations njng is a local natural gas distribution company that provides regulated retail energy services to approximately  residential and commercial customers in central and northern new jersey and participates in the off system sales and capacity release markets 
njng s business is seasonal by nature  as weather conditions directly influence the volume of natural gas delivered 
specifically  customer demand substantially increases during the winter months when natural gas is used for heating purposes 
as a result  njng receives most of its gas distribution revenues during the first and second fiscal quarters and is subject to variations in earnings and working capital during the year 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in february  the electric discount and energy competition act edeca  which provides the framework for the restructuring of new jersey s energy markets  became law 
in march  the bpu issued an order to fully open njng s residential markets to competition  restructure its rates to segregate its bgss and delivery ie  transportation service prices as required by edeca and expand an incentive for residential and small commercial customers to switch to transportation service 
njng earns no utility gross margin on the commodity portion of its natural gas sales 
njng earns utility gross margin through the delivery of natural gas to its customers 
in january  the bpu ordered that bgss could be provided by suppliers other than the state s natural gas utilities  but bgss should be provided by the state s natural gas utilities until further bpu action 
no additional action has been taken by the bpu subsequent to its initial order in january njng s financial results are summarized as follows thousands utility gross margin operating revenues less gas purchases energy and other taxes regulatory rider expense total utility gross margin utility gross margin residential and commercial transportation total utility firm gross margin incentive programs interruptible total utility gross margin operation and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization other taxes not reflected in utility gross margin operating income other income interest charges  net net income new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table summarizes total throughput in billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas by type through the njng distribution system bcf throughput residential and commercial transportation total firm throughput incentive programs interruptible total throughput utility gross margin njng s utility gross margin is defined as natural gas revenues less natural gas purchases  sales tax  a transitional energy facilities assessment tefa and regulatory rider expenses 
management believes that utility gross margin provides a more meaningful basis than revenue for evaluating utility operations since natural gas costs  sales tax  tefa and regulatory rider expenses are included in operating revenue and passed through to customers and  therefore  have no effect on utility gross margin 
this definition of utility gross margin may not be comparable to the definition of gross margin used by others in the natural gas distribution business and other industries 
natural gas costs are charged to operating expenses on the basis of therm sales at the prices in njng s bgss tariff  approved by the bpu 
the bgss tariff includes projected natural gas costs  net of supplier refunds  the impact of hedging activities and credits from non firm sales and transportation activities 
any underrecoveries or overrecoveries from the projected amounts are deferred and reflected in the bgss tariff in subsequent periods 
sales tax was calculated at percent of revenue for fiscal years and  as well as through july  on july   the sales tax was raised to percent of revenue 
the sales tax calculation excludes sales to cogeneration facilities  other utilities  off system sales and federal accounts 
tefa  which is included in energy and other taxes on the consolidated statements of income  is calculated on a per therm basis and excludes sales to cogeneration facilities  other utilities and off system sales 
tefa represents a regulatory allowed assessment imposed on all energy providers in the state 
in  along with the state sales tax and a state income tax  tefa replaced the utility gross receipts tax formula 
previously  non utility providers of energy were not subject to the gross receipts and franchise tax 
regulatory rider expenses consist of recovery of state mandated programs and the remediation adjustment clause costs 
these expenses are designed to be offset by corresponding revenues and are calculated on a per therm basis 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued njng s operating revenues remained flat at approximately billion in both fiscal and  after having increased from million  an increase of percent  in fiscal the minimal change in operating revenue from fiscal as compared to fiscal is the net effect of an increase in operating revenues associated with firm sales of million due primarily to bgss rates being adjusted in fiscal to provide provisional rate relief to njng in light of the volatile wholesale natural gas market  fully offset by a decrease due to a bgss customer refund of approximately million  which is inclusive of a sales tax refund of million  as a result of lower cost of gas purchases achieved through a successful natural gas commodity purchasing strategy and declining wholesale natural gas market prices  and a decrease in off system sales in the amount of million  which was primarily the result of a decrease in volume sold  partially offset by an increase in the average price of natural gas in comparison to fiscal levels 
the increase in operating revenue in fiscal from fiscal was the result of higher prices due primarily to the increase in wholesale natural gas commodity costs 
gas purchases increased less than percent to million in fiscal  as compared with million in fiscal the  increase in fiscal was due primarily to increased average gas prices offset by decreased volumes purchased 
gas purchases increased percent in fiscal as compared with fiscal purchases of million 
the increase in fiscal was the result of higher prices due primarily to the increase in wholesale natural gas commodity costs as a result of several significant weather events that impacted short term natural gas supplies 
sales tax and tefa  which are included in both revenues and energy and other taxes in the consolidated statements of income  totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
this increase in fiscal as compared with fiscal is due primarily to an increase in operating revenue from firm sales to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to its being in effect since mid july  the one percent increase in sales tax mandated by the state of new jersey did not materially impact the increase 
the increase in sales tax and tefa in fiscal was due primarily to higher operating revenue from firm sales of million in fiscal from million in fiscal regulatory rider expenses totaled million  million and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
the decrease in regulatory rider expenses in fiscal is a direct result of the decrease in firm throughput through the njng natural gas distribution system 
the increase in regulatory rider expense in fiscal is due primarily to higher rates associated with the remediation and clean energy riders 
utility gross margin is comprised of three major categories utility firm gross margin  which is derived from residential and commercial customers who receive natural gas service from njng through either sales or transportation tariffs  new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued incentive programs  where revenues generated or savings achieved from bpu approved off system sales  capacity release  financial risk management defined in incentive programs  below or storage incentive programs are shared between customers and njng  and utility gross margin from interruptible customers who have the ability to switch to alternative fuels and are subject to bpu approved incentives 
utility firm gross margin utility gross margin from residential and commercial customers was impacted by the wnc  which provided for a revenue adjustment if the weather varied by more than one half percent from normal weather ie  year average 
the accumulated adjustment from one heating season ie  october through may was billed or credited to customers in subsequent periods 
this mechanism reduced the variability of both customers bills and njng s earnings due to weather fluctuations 
the wnc did not  however  reflect reductions in customer usage from the assumed level in the wnc 
these reductions related to customer usage will be captured in njng s newly approved cip tariff effective in fiscal customers switching between sales service and transportation service affect the components of utility gross margin from firm customers 
njng s total utility gross margin is not negatively affected by customers who use its transportation service and purchase natural gas from another supplier because its tariff is designed so that no profit is earned on the commodity portion of sales to firm customers 
all customers who purchase natural gas from another supplier continue to use njng for transportation service 
total utility firm gross margin decreased million  or less than percent  and million  or less than percent  in fiscal and  respectively 
the change in fiscal was due primarily to the net effect of the decrease in natural gas used by customers  as the winter heating season was percent warmer compared with fiscal  a reduction in customer usage per degree day over the same period in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in fixed revenue as a result of customer growth  and the impact of the wnc 
the decrease in fiscal in comparison with fiscal  was due primarily to a reduction in customer usage per degree day 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued njng added  and  new customers and added natural gas heat and other services to another and existing customers in fiscal and  respectively 
this customer growth represents an estimated annual increase of approximately billion cubic feet bcf in sales to firm customers  assuming normal weather and usage 
the weather in fiscal was percent warmer than normal  therefore njng accrued million of utility gross margin for future recovery under the wnc 
in fiscal  the weather was percent colder than normal  therefore njng deferred million of gross margin for future refunds to customers under the wnc 
the weather in fiscal was percent warmer than normal  which resulted in no deferral or accrual of utility gross margin 
on october   njng filed supporting documentation for the fiscal wnc surcharge and proposed the required rate increase of approximately percent be effective on january  utility firm gross margin from sales to residential and commercial customers decreased  or less than percent  and increased  or less than percent  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
sales to residential and commercial customers were bcf in fiscal  compared with bcf in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in utility firm gross margin in fiscal compared with fiscal was due primarily to a warmer winter season  along with the lower usage per degree day  which was partially offset by customer growth 
the increase in utility firm gross margin in fiscal from was due primarily to customer growth and colder than normal temperatures  partially offset by lower usage per degree day 
utility firm gross margin from transportation service decreased  or percent  and million  or percent  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
njng transported bcf for its firm customers in fiscal  compared with bcf in fiscal and bcf in fiscal the decreases were due primarily to a reduction in customers utilizing the transportation service as a result of warmer weather and lower usage per degree day discussed above 
the following table shows residential and commercial customers using transportation services as of the end of each fiscal year september  residential commercial total the decrease in transportation customers for all fiscal years was due primarily to a decline in third party marketing efforts in njng s service territory 
the increase in commercial customers for all fiscal years  was due primarily to the change to monthly based pricing 
in fiscal and  njng currently expects to add approximately  and  new customers  respectively  and convert an additional existing customers each year to natural gas heat and other services 
achieving these expectations would represent an estimated annual customer growth rate of approximately percent and result in an estimated sales increase of approximately bcf annually 
it is believed that this growth would increase utility gross margin under present base new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued rates by approximately million annually  as calculated under njng s cip tariff  which is effective october  these growth expectations are based upon management s review of local planning board data  recent market research performed by third parties  builder surveys and studies of population growth rates in njng s service territory 
however  future sales will be affected by the weather  actual energy usage patterns of njng s customers  economic conditions in njng s service territory  conversion and conservation activity  the impact of changing from a regulated to a competitive environment  changes in state regulation and other marketing efforts  as has been the case in prior years 
incentive programs to reduce the overall cost of its natural gas supply commitments  njng has entered into contracts to sell natural gas to wholesale customers outside its franchise territory when the natural gas is not needed for system requirements 
these off system sales enable njng to spread its fixed demand costs  which are charged by pipelines to access their supplies year round  over a larger and more diverse customer base 
the off system sales program includes an incentive mechanism which shares the gains and losses on the program between customers and shareowners on an percent and percent basis  respectively 
njng also participates in the capacity release market on the interstate pipeline network when the capacity is not needed for its firm system requirements 
the financial risk management frm program is designed to provide price stability to njng s natural gas supply portfolio 
the frm program includes an incentive mechanism designed to encourage the use of financial instruments to hedge njng s natural gas costs  with a sharing of the costs and results between customers and shareowners  on an percent and percent basis  respectively 
the storage incentive program shares gains and losses between customers and shareowners  on an percent and percent basis  respectively 
this program measures the difference between the actual cost of natural gas in storage and a benchmark applicable to the april through october injection season 
on april   the bpu approved an agreement whereby the existing utility gross margin sharing programs between customers and shareowners were extended through october  njng s incentive programs totaled bcf and generated million of utility gross margin in fiscal  compared with bcf and million of utility gross margin in fiscal and bcf and million of utility gross margin in fiscal utility gross margin from incentive programs comprised percent of total utility gross margin in fiscal and percent of total utility gross margin in and  respectively 
the increases in utility gross margin in fiscal and  were primarily due to the frm and the storage incentive programs  which both benefited from additional volatility in the wholesale energy market 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interruptible njng serves customers through interruptible sales and or transportation tariffs 
sales made under the interruptible sales tariff are priced on market sensitive energy parity rates 
although therms sold and transported to interruptible customers represented percent of total throughput in fiscal  percent of total throughput in fiscal and percent of the total throughput in fiscal  they accounted for less than percent of the total utility gross margin in each year due to the sharing formulas that govern these sales 
under these formulas  njng retains percent of the utility gross margin from interruptible sales and percent of the utility gross margin from transportation sales  with percent and percent  respectively  credited to firm sales customers through the bgss 
interruptible sales were bcf and bcf in fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  njng transported bcf and bcf in fiscal and  respectively  for its interruptible customers 
operation and maintenance expense operation and maintenance expense increased million  or percent  in fiscal as compared with fiscal the increase was due primarily to higher regulatory costs  increased labor costs and an increase in bad debt expense 
higher regulatory costs are due primarily to the new cip program costs and higher bpu assessments 
increased labor costs are due primarily to annual wage increases and the absence of certain credits associated with incentive compensation benefits in the prior year that did not recur in the current year 
increased bad debt expense is due primarily to increased natural gas prices 
operation and maintenance expense decreased  or percent  in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  due primarily to lower costs associated with incentive compensation plans  decreased labor costs and lower information technology maintenance costs  which more than offset njng s share of the early retirement charge 
depreciation expense depreciation expense increased million in fiscal and million in fiscal due primarily to utility plant additions of million and million  respectively 
operating income operating income decreased million  or percent  in fiscal  compared with fiscal  due primarily to higher operation and maintenance expense  and higher depreciation expense  as described above 
operating income decreased million  or percent  in fiscal compared with fiscal  due primarily to the lower gross margin and higher depreciation expense  partially offset by lower operation and maintenance expense  as described above 
new jersey resources part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest charges interest charges increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to higher average interest rates on variable rate long and short term debt and interest costs payable to customers on overrecovered bgss balances 
in fiscal  interest increased million reflecting higher average interest rates on both long and short term debt 
net income net income decreased million  or percent  in fiscal  compared with fiscal  due primarily to lower operating income and higher interest expense as previously discussed

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management commodity market risks natural gas is a nationally traded commodity  and its prices are determined effectively by the new york mercantile exchange nymex and over the counter markets 
the prices on the nymex and over the counter markets generally reflect the notional balance of natural gas supply and demand  but are also influenced significantly from time to time by other events 
the regulated and unregulated natural gas businesses of the company and its subsidiaries are subject to market risk due to fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
to hedge against such fluctuations  the company and its subsidiaries have entered into futures contracts  options agreements and swap agreements 
to manage these instruments  the company has well defined risk management policies and procedures that include daily monitoring of volumetric limits and monetary guidelines 
the company s natural gas businesses are conducted through three of its operating subsidiaries 
first  njng is a regulated utility that uses futures  options and swaps to hedge against price fluctuations and its recovery of natural gas costs is governed by the bpu 
second  njres uses futures  options and swaps to hedge purchases and sales of natural gas 
finally  njr energy has entered into two swap transactions to hedge an year fixed price contract to sell remaining volumes of approximately bcf of natural gas gas sales contract to an energy marketing company

if a counterparty failed to perform the obligations under its contract for example  failed to deliver or pay for natural gas  then the company could sustain a loss 
this loss would comprise the loss on natural gas delivered but not paid for and or the cost of replacing natural gas not delivered at a price higher than the price in the original contract 
any such loss could have a material impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
