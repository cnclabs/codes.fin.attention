item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview we are a leading online seller of wireless services and devices based on the number of activations of wireless services sold online in the us through our wireless activation and services was segment  we sell services plans  devices and accessories  and satellite television services through our own branded websites  including wirefly 
com  a wireless 
com  and vmcsatellite 
com 
we offer marketers the ability to sell mobile virtual network operator mvno services to their customers under their own brands using our e commerce platform and operational infrastructure 
under mobile virtual network enabler mvne agreements  we give marketers the ability to sell wireless voice and data services that utilizes the same e commerce platform  operational infrastructure and marketing relationships that we developed for our was segment 
until the sale of liberty wireless in december we marketed and sold to consumers our own branded wireless airtime minutes 
additionally  we sell a variety of wireless data services 
we have developed a proprietary e commerce platform that integrates merchandising  procurement  customer care and billing into a single system for the online sale of wireless services and devices 
we measure our performance based on our financial results and various non financial measures 
key financial factors that we focus on in evaluating our performance include revenue growth within a period  contribution margin defined as revenue less cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses  and operating income defined as contribution margin less other operating expenses including general and administrative and depreciation and amortization expenses 
our financial results can  and do  vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors which include economic conditions specific to online commerce and wireless communications industries  the timing of introduction of popular devices by mobile phone manufacturer  our ability to attract visitors to our websites  changes in wireless carrier commission and bonus structures  the timing of recognition of bonuses paid to us by wireless carriers and our competitors pricing and marketing strategies 
our revenue includes commissions  bonuses and other payments we receive from wireless carriers  including a satellite television provider  in connection with the activation of customers on their networks  and from payments from customers for wireless services and devices 
our revenues and expenses continue to increase as a result of internal growth and acquisitions 
as further described below  total revenue and loss from continuing operations were million and million  respectively  for the year ended december   compared to total revenue and loss from continuing operations of million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  revenue from our top four wireless carriers represented and of our total revenue for and  respectively 
in  we expect the structure by which we earn commissions from three of the six largest wireless carriers will include an element of residual based compensation 
these carriers will commission activations based on a structure where we will receive a lower up front commission  in exchange for a recurring monthly residual commission 
the monthly residual commission will be based on a percentage of the monthly recurring charges for authorized rate plans  authorized features and additional local airtime charges the carrier bills to the customer or a flat fixed fee per subscriber  depending on the carrier 
we expect under these arrangements to receive this monthly residual for as long as the activated subscriber remains a customer of that carrier under the 
table of contents services contract we sell to them or a specified period of time  depending on the carrier 
accordingly  we expect that the amount of activations revenue recognized when a subscriber activates service will decrease  but that the decrease will be partially offset by the recurring monthly residual commission as explained above 
in addition  based on a residual commission structure  the amount of total revenue we recognize on a subscriber activation over the life of the residual relationship  may exceed the amount of revenue that would otherwise have been realized based on the full up front commission 
a major determinant of our revenue is the extent and success of our marketing efforts and expenditures 
our marketing efforts are conducted mainly through internet search engines which display links to our web sites based on search results and through third party incentive based on line marketing initiatives  including the use of websites that we create and manage under our marketers brands 
we also use online advertising  search engines and third party marketing partners based on orders and activations including msn  google  yahoo and aol 
we incurred total marketing and other advertising costs of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
on line marketing initiatives are a very important aspect of our business strategy because the underlying promotions will attract consumers to our websites or our partners websites 
in the fourth quarter of  we had to incur significantly higher and more sustained advertising and promotional expenses to generate activation revenue 
key non financial measures of our success are customer feedback and customer satisfaction ratings compiled by third parties 
we believe that maintaining high overall customer satisfaction is critical to our ongoing efforts to promote the use of our own branded websites  as well as the private labeled websites that we create and manage for our marketers  and to improve our operating results 
we actively solicit customer feedback on our website functionality  the entire purchase experience  and the performance of our operational service representatives 
if we are unable to meet customer expectations with respect to price or to customer care or do not successfully expand our product lines or otherwise fail to maintain high overall customer satisfaction  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
since we began operations in  we have incurred significant losses and had negative cash flow from operations 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and a total stockholders equity of million 
in order to achieve profitability in the future  we are depending upon our ability to continue to increase our revenue at levels that exceed the costs of that revenue plus operating expenses 
in  we grew our wireless activations business  expanded our services and broadened our customer base primarily through internal growth and two business asset acquisitions 
we may continue to be opportunistic in our acquisition of strategic assets as we seek to build our business 
in evaluating potential acquisitions  we must assess our expectations regarding the impact of a transaction on our revenues and net income  among many other factors 
we cannot assure that any acquisitions that we may complete in the future will have a positive impact on our revenues  net cash provided by operating activities  the valuation of our common stock or our efforts to attain and maintain profitability 
in  we expect to concentrate our resources on our was segment and the growth of our mvne segment 
three of our key goals include i improving the customer experience platform that we utilize for order processing  customer service and rebate handling to automate additional processes and make more efficient use of system and internal work force and outsourced call center resources  ii further balancing spending on marketing initiatives with customer activation and revenue generation characteristics  and iii reducing certain general and administrative operating expenses

table of contents segment overview we manage our business through three reportable segments was  mvne services and data services 
our was segment has two business units  wireless activation and satellite television 
these business units sell and activate wireless services and devices of wireless carriers and a satellite television carrier through private labeled websites that we create and manage for marketers as well as through our own branded websites 
the wireless carriers pay us commissions and bonuses for activating these wireless services

sales and marketing expenses also included stock based compensation expense of million for we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in our marketing expenses largely comprise payments to on line advertisers  search engines and third party marketing partners based on orders or activations 
we incurred approximately million of the increase in these third party marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of such expenses were higher in our fourth quarter as wireless activation competition increased  the cost of advertising increased in both rate and volume  which caused our customer acquisition costs to increase from prior quarters in in addition  advertising placement and search costs also increased from comparable prior periods during the fourth quarter

the significant components of our working capital are inventory and liquid assets such as cash and trade accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
based on current and anticipated levels of operations  we anticipate that available cash balances of million at december  along with borrowings available under our line of credit and trade credit available from the wireless carriers and handset manufacturers will be sufficient to fund net cash used in operating activities  planned capital expenditures and anticipated repurchases of our common stock for at least the next twelve month period 
we had million outstanding under our line of credit at december  we have not been in compliance with certain of our covenants under our line of credit for each of the quarters ended june  september  and december  although we received waivers from our lender of our non compliance with each of these covenants  there is no assurance that we will be in compliance with our covenants in the future  and if not in compliance  that we will receive a waiver 
our future capital and operating requirements  however  may change and will depend on many factors  including the level of our revenues  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the cost of our fulfillment operations  potential investments in businesses or technologies and continued market acceptance of our products 
additionally  poor financial results  unanticipated expenses  acquisitions of technologies or businesses or strategic investments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect 
in the event that cash on 
table of contents hand and available borrowings are not sufficient to fund working capital requirements that are not satisfied through net cash provided by operating activities or future cash requirements  we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding through a public or private equity or debt financing in the future  and this financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all

net cash used in operating activities in was primarily attributable to significant increases in accounts receivable and inventory due to increased sales and expected sales volumes 
the majority of the accounts receivable balance relates to amounts due from wireless carriers

cash provided by financing activities in consisted mainly of borrowings under our credit facility of million  proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options of million partially offset by cash payments used to repurchase  shares of our common stock for million 
borrowings under line of credit 
as of december   we maintained a revolving operating line of credit with comerica bank which allowed for aggregate borrowing of up to million subject to certain limits based on accounts receivable and inventory levels 
during  we borrowed an aggregate principal amount of million under the facility 
this facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
interest on advances under the revolving line of credit is payable monthly at a rate of libor plus 
common stock repurchase program 
our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate amount of million 
during  we repurchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for approximately million 
between january  and february   we repurchased an additional  shares of common stock at an average price of per share for  there can be no assurance that we will repurchase up to the full amount that we have been authorized by our board of directors over this time period 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations  including interest on capital leases  and the expected effect on liquidity and cash flows as of december  total less than year years years over years amounts in thousands line of credit capital leases operating leases obligations under vmc apa a under the vmc asset purchase agreement  as amended  we are required to issue vmc shares of our common stock or cash with a fair value of million on the distribution date of the second tranche of stock consideration 
this is recorded as an accrued liability as of december   in addition  we may be obligated to pay shareholders of vmc an additional million in cash and up to  shares of our common stock if vmc attains certain future operating targets 
such potential obligation has not been included in the table above 
inflation we believe that inflation has not affected our operations materially 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
generally  the approach of sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we will adopt sfas no 
r effective january   using the modified prospective application method 
under this method  sfas no 
r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered such as unvested options that are outstanding as of the date of adoption  shall be recognized as the remaining requisite services are rendered 
the compensation cost relating to unvested awards at the date of adoption shall be based on the fair value at the date of grant of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas no 
we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r will impact our financial results in the future  as it is expected to reduce the net income we generate or increase the amount of net losses we incur 
as of december   we have unamortized stock based compensation expense of million  of which million is expected to be expensed in with the remaining million to be amortized over the remaining vesting periods through  for both stock options and restricted stock awards 
of this anticipated expense however  our operating results would have recognized stock based compensation expense of approximately million for such unvested stock awards following the apb no 
methodology in place prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
as such  we expect the incremental impact from the adoption of sfas no 
r to increase estimated stock based compensation expenses for by approximately million 
the anticipated expense amount referred to above does not reflect the expense associated with equity awards that are expected to be granted to employees in and  while we expect to continue granting equity based awards to our employees  management and our board of directors have not finalized its plans for granting 
table of contents equity based awards for accordingly  the overall effect of adopting this new standard on the financial results has not yet been quantified 
the pro forma effects on net loss and loss per share attributable to common stockholders if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of the original sfas no 
on stock compensation awards are included in note n to our consolidated financial statements and disclosed in
