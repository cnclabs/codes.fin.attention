background information on certain trends and strategies several key trends in the healthcare marketplace are influencing the use of healthcare information services and technology solutions of the types we provide or are developing 
those trends  and the strategies we have developed in response  are described briefly below high rates of increase in healthcare costs 
according to the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  healthcare spending in the united states rose to trillion in or approximately six thousand three hundred dollars per person  up from trillion in  trillion in  trillion in and trillion in the cms report indicated a growth rate in healthcare spending of in  compared to for  and for in addition  cms indicated that healthcare s share of gross domestic product was for another study recently released by cms predicted that us healthcare spending will increase by an average of annually until  at which time such spending will reach trillion or approximately twelve thousand three hundred dollars per person and account for of the gross domestic product 
the difficulties involved in controlling healthcare costs have resulted in the following key trends changes in health plan design  health management initiatives 
while overall healthcare costs are rising at a rapid annual rate  employers costs of providing healthcare benefits to their employees are increasing at an even faster rate 
in response to these increases  employers are seeking to shift a greater portion of healthcare costs onto their employees and to redefine traditional health benefits 
employers and health plans want to motivate their members and employees to evaluate their healthcare decisions more carefully in order to be more cost effective 
as employers continue to implement high deductible and consumer directed healthcare plans to achieve these goals  we believe that webmd will be able to attract more employers and health plans to use its private online portals 
in addition  health plans and employers have begun to recognize that encouraging the good health of their members and employees not only benefits the members and employees but also has financial benefits for the health plans and employers 
accordingly  many employers and health plans have been enhancing health management programs and taking steps to provide healthcare information and education to employees and members  including through online services 
we believe that webmd is well positioned to benefit from these trends because webmd s private portals provide the tools and information employees and plan members need in order to make more informed decisions about healthcare provider  benefit and treatment options 
additionally  we believe that as consumers are required to bear increased financial responsibility for their healthcare  webmd s public portals will benefit as consumers utilize webmd s decision support and personal health information applications to better manage their health decisions 
pay for performance initiatives 
controlling costs by keeping people healthier and better managing chronic conditions has become a significant focus for america s healthcare system 
both governmental and commercial payers have begun to reassess current healthcare provider compensation arrangements  which generally reimburse physicians and other healthcare providers based on the number and 
table of contents complexity of the services provided to patients 
pay for performance initiatives reward healthcare providers for better outcomes and adherence to evidence based guidelines 
these initiatives typically create incentives for improvements in the quality of care and for an increased focus on preventive medicine and appropriate management of chronic illnesses 
the goal is both better outcomes and reductions in hospitalizations and expensive procedures 
information technology plays an important role in pay for performance initiatives  including with respect to the delivery of quality care by providers and quality measurement by payers 
some pay for performance programs provide incentives for use of electronic medical record systems  such as intergy ehr  by providers 
vips provides software and services that help health plans identify and serve members who need the most care and to anticipate the future needs of member populations 
in addition  webmd provides online private portals that assist employers and health plans in educating and encouraging employees and plan members to lower health risks and to take a more active role in their healthcare 
increasing automation of the healthcare reimbursement cycle 
submission of claims electronically assists payers in reducing the cost of processing and servicing claims and can expedite the reimbursement process for providers 
however  this is just a starting point for increasing administrative efficiency 
we have been transforming emdeon business services from an electronic transactions clearinghouse to a provider of more complete reimbursement cycle management services for healthcare providers and payers 
our services for payers now also include conversion of paper claims to electronic ones and related document management services  as well as paid claims communication services 
we also act as the electronic transactions gateway for some of our payer customers  which allows us to work more closely with them to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the electronic transactions coming into their systems 
in addition  by outsourcing patient encounter transaction processes to us  payers can reduce their capital expenses and operating costs 
our services for providers now also include systems to validate patient insurance benefits electronically  to edit and submit electronic claims  to manage remittance advices  to post payments automatically and to process patient statements 
we are also developing additional capabilities and services  including electronic payment processes 
we expect that revenue and earnings from providing basic electronic clearinghouse services for routine healthcare transactions will  on their own  continue to decline 
however  we believe that the revenue and earnings of our other transaction related services are likely to continue to offset any such decline 
we have also taken steps to lower the rates of the sales commissions we pay to practice management and hospital information system vendors and other channel partners which  from a net earnings perspective  will offset some of the impact of the declining revenue from basic clearing houses 
nonetheless  we believe that it is possible that  during certain reporting periods  revenue and net earnings from basic clearinghouse services could decline faster than we are able to increase the revenue and earnings from our additional services 
increased use of information technology for clinical purposes 
healthcare providers are under pressure to increase quality and reduce medical errors 
while information technology systems and electronic transaction services are used by many physician offices for administrative and financial applications  their use in clinical workflow is much more limited  especially in smaller practices 
however  we believe this is changing 
emdeon practice services and emdeon business services are continuing to target the markets for clinical applications as one of their priorities 
while it will be a long time before most physicians go to a paperless office  more physicians are beginning to incorporate information technology into their clinical workflow 
as discussed above under high rates of increase in healthcare costs pay for performance initiatives and below under governmental initiatives relating to healthcare information technology  healthcare payers and governmental authorities are increasingly taking steps to encourage physicians to use information technology in their treatment of patients and clinical processes 
since clinical applications are generally designed for use by physicians  nurses and other healthcare providers  the markets for those applications present different 
table of contents challenges than the markets for administrative and financial applications  which are used mostly by administrative personnel  billing coordinators and financial managers 
we have been and will continue to invest in the additional resources necessary to meet the challenges involved in developing and implementing clinical applications 
we believe that success in the markets for clinical applications will become increasingly important in competing in the markets for administrative and financial applications 
increased online marketing and education spending for healthcare products 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies spend large amounts each year marketing their products and educating consumers and physicians about them  however  only a small portion of this amount is currently spent on online services 
we believe that these companies  who comprise the majority of webmd s advertisers and sponsors  are becoming increasingly aware of the effectiveness of the internet relative to traditional media in providing health  clinical and product related information to consumers and physicians  and this increasing awareness will result in increasing demand for webmd s services 
governmental initiatives relating to healthcare information technology 
there are currently numerous federal  state and private initiatives seeking ways to increase the use of information technology in healthcare  including in the physician s office 
most significantly  in april  executive order directed the appointment of a national coordinator for health information technology to coordinate programs and policies regarding health information technology across the federal government 
in may  david j 
brailer md  md  was appointed to serve in this position 
the national coordinator is charged with directing the health information technology programs within the department of health and human services  or hhs  and coordinating them with those of other relevant executive branch agencies 
in addition  the mission of the national coordinator includes supporting and encouraging the use of health information technology in the public and private health care delivery systems and coordinating partnerships between government agencies and private sector stakeholders to speed the adoption of health information technology 
we share  and have been working towards  many of the same goals as the governmental initiatives relating to health information technology 
we believe that our businesses may be good candidates to work with hhs and other governmental authorities on their initiatives and projects and may also benefit for the focus those initiatives create on the benefits of products and services of the types we provide 
the market for healthcare in the united states is highly complicated and there can be no assurance that the trends identified above will continue or that the expected benefits to emdeon s businesses from our responses to those trends will be achieved 
in addition  the markets for healthcare information services and technology solutions are highly competitive and not only are our existing competitors seeking to benefit from these same trends  but the trends may also attract additional competitors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of emdeon s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current business factors  and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  the recorded amounts of revenue and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic  and political factors  and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  short term and long term investments  deferred tax assets  income taxes  collectibility of customer receivables  prepaid advertising and distribution services  long lived assets including goodwill and other intangible assets  software development costs  inventory valuation  certain accrued expenses  contingencies  litigation and the value attributed to warrants issued for services 
we believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue our revenue recognition policies for each reportable operating segment are as follows emdeon business services 
healthcare payers and providers pay us fees for transaction services  generally on either a per transaction basis or  in the case of some providers  on a monthly fixed fee basis 
healthcare payers and providers also pay us fees for document conversion  patient statement and paid claims communication services  typically on a per document  per statement or per communication basis 
additionally  payers  including government payers  pay us fees to license decision support software and provide related support and maintenance for that decision support software  and provide information technology consulting services 
healthcare payers pay us annual license fees  which are based on the number of covered members  for use of our software and pay us time and materials fees for providing business and information technology consulting services to them 
the professional consulting services we provide to certain governmental agencies are typically billed on a cost plus fee structure 
revenue for transaction services  patient statement and paid claims communication services is recognized as the services are provided 
decision support software and the related support and maintenance agreements are generally sold as bundled time based license agreements and  accordingly  the revenue for both the software and related support and maintenance is recognized ratably over the term of the license and maintenance agreement 
revenue for consulting services is recognized as the services are provided 
emdeon practice services 
healthcare providers pay us fees to license the medical manager  intergy  healthpro xl and medware practice management systems  as well as certain other practice management systems we own and our intergy ehr electronic medical records system 
our practice management systems are generally sold as multiple element arrangements as these software arrangements typically include related hardware  support and maintenance agreements and implementation and training services 
we also charge healthcare providers fees for transmitting  through emdeon network services  transactions to payers and billing statements to patients 
we recognize revenue from these fees  which are generally paid on a per transaction or monthly basis  as we provide the service 
software revenue is recognized in accordance with sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
software license revenue is recognized when a customer enters into a non cancelable license agreement  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  there are no significant future performance obligations  the license fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the license fee is considered probable 
amounts received in advance of meeting these criteria are deferred 
as required by sop  we determine the value of the software component of our multiple element arrangements using the residual method as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements such as the support and maintenance agreements and related implementation and training services  but not for all the delivered elements such as the software itself 
the residual method requires revenue to be allocated to the undelivered elements based on the fair value of such elements  as indicated by vsoe 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
the vast majority of our practice management and medical records systems include support and maintenance agreements of the underlying software and hardware 
these arrangements provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades released during the term of the support 
table of contents period  as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel 
revenue from support and maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically one year or less

porex 
we develop  manufacture and distribute porous plastic products and components 
for standard products  we recognize revenue upon shipment of product  net of sales returns and allowances 
for sales of certain custom products  we recognize revenue upon completion and customer acceptance 
recognition of amounts received in advance is deferred until all criteria have been met 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisitions we have made 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on our estimates of the future benefit of the intangible asset using accepted valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets  excluding goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determined based on the consideration of several factors  including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually  or whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of goodwill 
there was no impairment of goodwill noted as a result of our impairment testing in  and investments our investments  at december   consisted principally of certificates of deposit  auction rate securities  us treasury notes and marketable equity securities in publicly traded companies 
each reporting period we evaluate the carrying value of our investments and record a loss on investments when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
our investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value 
we do not recognize gains on an investment until sold 
unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
once realized  the gains and losses and declines in value determined to be other than temporary are recorded 
a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary if we do not have the intent and ability to retain the investment until any anticipated recovery in market value  the extent and length of the time to which the market value has been less than cost and the financial condition and near term prospects of the investment 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss of  on marketable debt securities that we identified as securities to be liquidated for the redemption of the notes 
the loss represented the excess of the original book value of those investments over their market value 
deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately billion 
these loss carryforwards may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
as of december   a valuation allowance was established for all domestic net deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty of 
table of contents realization of the deferred tax assets due to a lack of earnings history 
realization is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards in future periods 
although realization is not currently assured  management evaluates the need for a valuation allowance each quarter  and in the future  should management determine that realization of net deferred tax assets is more likely than not  some or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed  and our effective tax rate will be reduced 
the valuation allowance excludes the impact of any deferred items related to certain of our foreign operations as the realization of the deferred items for these operations is likely 
tax contingencies our tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by tax authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our estimates of tax contingencies reflect assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
we believe that these assumptions and judgments are reasonable  however  our accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter and the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued

recent accounting pronouncements on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
the guidance in this fsp addresses the determination of when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
this fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the guidance is to be applied prospectively in periods beginning after december  we believe the adoption of this fsp will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  we adopted eitf issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements eitf  which provides new guidance for assessing amortization periods for leasehold improvements placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the initial lease term and acquired in a business combination 
the guidance requires that the amortization of the leasehold improvement be based on the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and reasonably assured renewal periods 
the adoption of eitf in the second quarter of did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also defines retrospective application as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used or as the adjustment of previously issued financial statements to reflect a change in the reporting entity and redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
sfas also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as a change in nondiscretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and  accordingly  will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  fasb issued sfas no 
 revised share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas and supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the fiscal year that begins after june  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas r on january  we will adopt the modified prospective transition method utilizing the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
the modified prospective method requires that we begin recording compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas r using the same grant date fair value and same expense attribution method used under sfas additionally  upon adoption of sfas r  we will apply the straight line attribution method for all equity grants subsequent to january  rather than the accelerated method that we have used for all grants  prior to january  we expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
the amendments made by sfas are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
previously  apb opinion no 
required that the accounting for an exchange of a productive asset for a similar productive asset or an equivalent interest in the same or similar productive asset should be based on the recorded amount of the asset relinquished 
we will apply the provisions in sfas prospectively on january  which we believe will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility  freight handling and wasted material expenses and requires those expenses to be recognized in the period incurred 
additionally  sfas requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we currently follow the provisions of sfas and no material impact has occurred to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity  while at the same time maximizing the yield we receive from our investment portfolio 
this objective is accomplished by adherence to our investment policy  which establishes the list of eligible types of securities and credit requirements for each investment 
changes in prevailing interest rates will cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities in commercial paper  non governmental debt securities  money market funds and highly liquid united states treasury notes 
we view these high grade securities within our portfolio as having similar market risk characteristics 
principal amounts expected to mature during are million 
the notes and the notes that we have issued have fixed interest rates  changes in interest rates will not impact our financial condition or results of operations 
we have not utilized derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 

table of contents exchange rate sensitivity currently  substantially all of our sales and expenses are denominated in united states dollars  however  porex is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the rate of exchange of the united states dollar against the euro 
this exposure arises primarily as a result of translating the results of porex s foreign operations to the united states dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the accounting period 
porex has not engaged in foreign currency hedging activities to date 
foreign currency translation gains losses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we believe that future exchange rate sensitivity related to porex will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations
