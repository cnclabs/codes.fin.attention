real estate rental real estate assets  including land  buildings and improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment  are recorded at cost and reported net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
tenant improvements  which are included in buildings and improvements  are also stated at cost 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as they are incurred 
renovations and or replacements  which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed utilizing the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of ten to thirty years for buildings and improvements and three to twenty years for machinery and equipment 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company lengthen the expected useful life of a particular asset  it would be depreciated over more years  and result in less depreciation expense and higher annual net income

a property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
such cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors
