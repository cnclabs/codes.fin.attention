an analysis of operating income by industry segment follows 
during  ashland redefined its reporting segments as it continues to evolve into a diversified  global chemical company 
performance materials and water technologies  formerly combined under ashland specialty chemical  have now been separately disclosed since these businesses serve different markets and recent acquisitions have made water technologies a much larger and more distinct part of ashland 
segment operating results reflect new methodology adopted in october for allocating substantially all corporate expenses to ashland s operating businesses  with the exception of certain legacy costs or items clearly not associated with the operating divisions 
additional corporate expenses allocated to ashland s four remaining operating divisions under this new methodology amounted to million in  million in and million in however  the sale of apac in august and the reclassification of apac s results as discontinued operations impacted this methodology change 
under generally accepted accounting principles  allocations of general corporate overhead may not be allocated to discontinued operations for financial statement presentation 
as a result  the unallocated and other component of operating income primarily represents corporate overhead previously allocated to apac 
results for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the new allocation methodology 
performance materials performance materials reported record operating income of million for  a increase compared to million for sales and operating revenues increased  from  million for to  million for  reflecting increased prices 
the gross profit margin increased to from in  resulting in a million increase in operating income 
pounds per shipping day decreased from million pounds for to million pounds for  resulting in an million decline in operating income 
when these volumes are adjusted for the maleic anhydride business transferred to marathon as part of the map transaction in the volumes decreased 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million in the period  reflecting a million increase in environmental remediation expenses  while the period included million in gains from the sale of an idle plant and the termination of a product supply contract 
performance materials reported operating income of million for  a improvement compared to million for sales and operating revenues increased  from  million for to  million for  reflecting increased prices and increased volumes from the december acquisition of the derakane r resins business 
the gross profit margin was unchanged at  resulting in a million increase in operating income on the increased sales 
pounds per shipping day increased from million pounds for to million pounds for  resulting in a million increase in operating income 
sg a expenses increased million in the period  reflecting the derakane r acquisition and a million increase in environmental remediation expenses 
in addition  the period included million in gains from the sale of an idle plant and the termination of a product supply contract  while the period included a million gain on the sale of some idle land 
distribution distribution reported record operating income of million for  a increase compared to million for sales and operating revenues were a record  million for  a increase compared to  million for gross profit as a percent of sales decreased from for to for  but increased on a cents per pound basis  resulting in a million increase in operating income 
pounds per shipping day declined from million pounds in to million pounds in  reducing operating income by million 
a disciplined cost structure resulted in a decline in sg a expenses of million  despite a million increase in environmental remediation expenses 
m distribution reported operating income of million for  a improvement compared to million for sales and operating revenues increased from  million in to  million in  reflecting increased selling prices  as pounds per shipping day declined due to the disposition of the ingestibles business 
adjusting for the ingestibles disposition  pounds per shipping day increased 
gross profit as a percent of sales increased slightly  from to  demonstrating the division s success in passing through rising raw material costs and aggressively managing expenses 
the slight margin increase on higher sales dollars resulted in a million increase in gross profit  partially offset by a million decline due to lower volumes 
sg a expenses increased million  including a million increase in environmental remediation expenses 
valvoline valvoline reported an operating loss of million for  compared to operating income of million for the decline primarily reflected rapidly rising raw material costs which eroded the gross profit margin as it decreased from in to in  resulting in a million decline in operating income 
the lower margin reflected increases in material costs  which were not fully offset by price increases in the marketplace 
lubricant sales volumes declined  from million gallons in to million gallons in  reflecting a weak consumer market 
the net impact of volume fluctuations in all product lines resulted in an million decrease in operating income 
also included in results was an impairment charge of million related to certain valvoline instant oil change vioc locations 
international operating income declined primarily due to higher raw material costs 
sg a expenses increased million compared to the prior year  reflecting higher costs related to globalone  litigation issues and severance 
valvoline reported operating income of million for  compared to million for the decline primarily reflected an decrease in lubricant sales volumes from million gallons in to million gallons in  resulting in a million decrease in gross profit 
sg a expenses  including globalone and allocated corporate expenses  increased million compared to the prior year 
earnings from vioc decreased due to the sale of vioc centers to marathon in the map transaction on june   and a decrease in the number of oil changes 
partially offsetting these decreases were record results from valvoline s international operations  which increased compared to on the strength of improved results in europe and latin america 
water technologies water technologies reported operating income of million for compared to million for results for included an million foreign currency hedge gain on the may acquisition of the water treatment business of degussa ag and a million gain on insurance settlements  partially offset by a million charge for severance costs due to restructuring the business 
the operations acquired in the degussa acquisition  now operating as the environmental and process solutions e ps group within water technologies  added million to operating income 
excluding the impact of these items  operating income declined million 
sales and operating revenues increased to million in  compared to million in the e ps business accounted for million  or  of the increase 
the gross profit margin decreased from in to in  as price increases could not keep pace with rising raw material costs 
this decrease also reflects the acquired e ps business  which has a lower gross profit percentage than ashland s other water businesses 
water technologies reported operating income of million for compared to million for sales and operating revenues increased to million for compared to million for the gross profit margin decreased from in to in  as rising raw material costs could not be fully recovered through price increases 
refining and marketing operating income from refining and marketing  which consisted primarily of equity income from ashland s ownership interest in map through june   amounted to million in  compared to million in equity income from map s refining and marketing operations for the nine months ended june  was million higher than for all of  reflecting an increase of per barrel in its refining and wholesale marketing margin 
equity income from map s retail operations speedway superamerica and a interest in the pilot travel centers joint venture for the nine months ended june  was million higher than for all of  reflecting higher merchandise margins 
equity income from map s transportation operations for the nine months ended june  was million lower than for all of  reflecting the three less months of operations during ashland s period of ownership 
ashland s environmental remediation expenses for former refining and marketing sites  including those conveyed to map for which ashland retained remediation obligations up to a maximum of million for costs incurred on or after january   amounted to million in  versus income of million in resulting from reductions in estimated reserves 
m unallocated and other unallocated and other costs  consisting of certain legacy costs or items clearly not associated with the operating divisions  were million in  million in and million in as described on page m  these amounts included costs previously allocated to apac of million in  million in and million in in addition to the ongoing costs that typically occur each year related to formerly owned businesses  included million in environmental remediation expenses  income of million from an insurance claim recovery and income of million from the favorable adjustment to the previously estimated withdrawal premium due oil insurance limited oil  the energy industry mutual insurance consortium in which ashland terminated its participation effective december  included in were million in charges for estimated future premiums due oil  resulting from a higher level of losses than anticipated for the members of oil  due primarily to the effects of a highly active hurricane season during loss gain on the map transaction see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the map transaction and the resulting pretax gain of  million recorded in ashland recorded a loss on the map transaction of million in  as a result of a decrease in the discounted receivable from marathon for the estimated present value of future tax deductions 
the loss resulted primarily from a million reclassification of certain tax benefits related to previously owned businesses of ashland 
the offsetting benefit was recorded in income taxes as deferred tax benefits 
loss on early retirement of debt see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the early retirement of debt associated with the map transaction  which resulted in a pretax loss of million recorded in net intererst and other financing income costs the following table summarizes the components of net interest and other financing income costs 
in millions net interest and other financing income costs interest income interest expense expenses on sales of accounts receivable other financing costs the decrease in interest expense and increase in interest income for and reflect the retirement of most of ashland s debt from the proceeds of the map transaction in june as described in note e of notes to consolidated financial statements  and the temporary investment of the remaining proceeds in cash equivalents and short term  available for sale securities 
income tax expense benefit ashland s income tax expense for included million in tax benefits unrelated to pretax earnings for during  ashland recognized million in tax benefits resulting from the resolution of domestic and foreign tax matters and the reevaluation of income tax reserves related to prior years 
also during  million in tax benefits were recorded to adjust the income tax provision to the tax returns as ultimately filed 
as described in note e of notes to consolidated financial statements  ashland s income tax benefit for included a benefit of million associated with the map transaction  resulting from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities 
also as described in note e  the pretax gain of  million was non taxable to ashland 
ashland s income tax benefit for also included million in tax benefits related to prior years 
these benefits resulted primarily from a favorable settlement with the internal revenue service irs for the audit period and the reevaluation of income tax reserves related to other years 
ashland s income tax expense for included million in tax benefits related to prior years 
during the year  ashland reached resolution with the irs on several open tax matters from prior years  resulting in a tax benefit of million as a result of the reduction of amounts previously provided as contingent tax liabilities 
in addition  ashland recognized federal income tax benefits associated with a claim for additional research and development tax credits valued at million 
m excluding these identified items  ashland s adjusted effective tax rate was in  compared to in and in the overall effective rate was lower in than in and due to ashland s lower level of pretax income from continuing operations in and the resulting larger relative portion of those earnings derived from income taxed at less than full us statutory rates 
see note m of notes to consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation of ashland s tax provision for the last three years to the us statutory rate 
income from discontinued operations net of income taxes results of ashland s discontinued operations are summarized below 
see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements for an explanation of these amounts 
in millions income from discontinued operations net of income taxes apac results of operations gain on sale of operations asbestos related litigation reserves and expenses electronic chemicals loss on sale of operations ashland recorded an after tax gain on the sale of apac of million in net income from the results of operations of apac amounted to million in  million in and million in the increase from to reflected improved margins on construction jobs and material sales and favorable weather 
the decline from to reflected weather delays due to the highly active hurricane and tropical storm season in and rapidly rising raw material and energy costs 
financial position liquidity cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations  a major source of ashland s liquidity  amounted to a cash inflow of million in  a cash outflow of million in and a cash inflow of million in such amounts included cash distributions from map of million in and million in during  ashland paid income taxes of million  compared with million in and million in ashland contributed million to its qualified pension plans in  compared with million in and million in cash payments for interest expense amounted to million in  million in and million in cash flows from operating activities of discontinued operations  consisting primarily of the operating cash flows from apac  amounted to cash inflows of million in  million in and million in ashland s financial position has enabled it to obtain capital for its financing needs 
following shareholder approval of the map transaction in june  moody s lowered ashland s senior debt rating from baa to ba  their highest non investment grade rating  and also lowered ashland s commercial paper rating from p to n p not prime  citing the annual cash flow lost from the operations sold 
in august  standard poor s lowered ashland s senior debt rating from bbb to bb  their highest non investment grade rating  and lowered ashland s commercial paper rating from a to b  citing ashland s intention to distribute the apac proceeds to shareholders instead of using the proceeds for business investment 
ashland has a revolving credit agreement that expires on march   which provides for up to million in borrowings 
the borrowing capacity under this facility was reduced by million of letters of credit outstanding at september  the revolving credit agreement contains a covenant limiting the total debt ashland may incur from all sources as a function of ashland s stockholders equity 
the covenant s terms would have permitted ashland to borrow billion at september   in addition to the actual total debt incurred at that time 
permissible total ashland debt under the covenant s terms increases or decreases by of any increase or decrease in stockholders equity 
at september   working capital excluding debt due within one year amounted to  million  compared to  million at the end of ashland s working capital is affected by its use of the lifo method of inventory valuation 
that method valued inventories below their replacement costs by million at september  and million at september  liquid assets cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and accounts receivable amounted to of current liabilities at september   compared to at september capital resources on september  ashland s board of directors authorized the distribution of a substantial portion of the proceeds of the sale of apac to the ashland common stock shareholders as a one time special dividend 
each shareholder of record m as of october   received per share  for a total of million 
this amount is accrued as dividends payable in the consolidated balance sheet at september  substantially all of the remaining proceeds were directed to be used to repurchase ashland common stock in accordance with the terms authorized by ashland s board of directors 
see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of ashland s share repurchase programs 
ashland repurchased million shares for million during fiscal year since the inception of the first described share repurchase program on july  through september   ashland had repurchased a total of million shares at a cost of million 
following the completion of the current share repurchase program ashland estimates it will have purchased approximately of the shares outstanding on june  the stock repurchase actions are consistent with certain representations of intent made to the internal revenue service with respect to the transfer of map 
property additions excluding the property additions of the discontinued operations of apac amounted to million during the last three years and are summarized in the information by industry segment on page f for the past three years  performance materials accounted for of ashland s capital expenditures  while distribution accounted for  valvoline accounted for and water technologies accounted for 
capital used for acquisitions amounted to million during the last three years  of which million was invested in performance materials  million in distribution  million in valvoline and million in water technologies 
a summary of the capital employed in ashland s current operations as of the end of the last three years follows 
in millions capital employed performance materials distribution valvoline water technologies during  ashland reduced its total debt by million to million and stockholders equity decreased by million to billion 
increases in stockholders equity resulting from million of net income  million from issuance of common shares under stock incentive and other plans  a million decrease in the minimum pension liability and million of translation gains associated with foreign operations were more than offset by decreases resulting from common stock repurchases of million  the special cash dividend of million related to the apac divestiture  regular cash dividends of million  and million in unrealized losses on cash flow hedges 
debt as a percent of capital employed was at september  compared to at september  during  ashland expects capital expenditures of approximately million compared with million in the budgeted expenditures for include million for compliance matters  million for maintenance of capabilities  million for productivity enhancements and cost reductions  and million for growth projects 
in  ashland initiated a multi year sap enterprise resource planning erp project that is expected to increase efficiency and effectiveness in supply chain  financial  and environmental  health and safety processes 
the implementation of the erp system in the us began in october  and while early indications are that the initial implementation was successful  such implementations carry substantial risk  including the potential for business interruption and associated adverse impacts on operating results 
the scope of the project was expanded in to include new  additional functionality and the overall costs for this project through are now expected to total approximately million  of which approximately million will be capitalized 
costs for are expected to total approximately million  of which approximately million will be capitalized 
the following table aggregates ashland s commitments to make future payments under existing contracts at september  contractual cash obligations for which the ultimate settlement amounts are not fixed and determinable have been excluded 
later in millions total years contractual obligations raw material purchase obligations employee benefit obligations a operating lease obligations long term debt b total contractual obligations a includes estimated funding of ashland s qualified us and us pension plans for  as well as projected benefit payments through under ashland s nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
see note q of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
b includes principal and interest payments 
capitalized lease obligations are not significant and are included in long term debt 
m off balance sheet arrangements ashland and its subsidiaries are lessees of office buildings  retail outlets  transportation equipment  warehouses and storage facilities  and other equipment  facilities and properties under leasing agreements that expire at various dates 
capitalized lease obligations are not significant and are included in long term debt 
in june  ashland used million of the proceeds from the map transaction to purchase assets primarily apac construction equipment and vioc stores formerly leased under operating leases 
future minimum rental payments were not affected by this purchase 
on march   ashland entered into a five year agreement to sell  on an ongoing basis with limited recourse  up to a million undivided interest in a designated pool of accounts receivable 
under the terms of the agreement  new receivables were added to the pool and collections reduced the pool 
ashland retained a credit interest in these receivables and addressed its risk of loss on this retained interest in its allowance for doubtful accounts 
receivables sold excluded defaulted accounts or concentrations over certain limits with any one customer 
on march   this agreement was extended for a period of one year and the capacity was increased to million 
the agreement was terminated by ashland on july  application of critical accounting policies the preparation of ashland s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include long lived assets  employee benefit obligations  income taxes  reserves and associated receivables for asbestos litigation and environmental remediation 
although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the audit committee of ashland s board of directors 
long lived assets the cost of plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives are based on historical experience and are adjusted when changes in planned use  technological advances or other factors show that a different life would be more appropriate 
such costs are periodically reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present 
such indicators include  among other factors  operating losses  unused capacity  market value declines and technological obsolescence 
recorded values of property  plant and equipment that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value  which generally is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows assets held for use or net realizable value assets held for sale 
asset impairment charges were million in and were not significant in and although circumstances can change considerably over time  ashland is not aware of any impairment indicators that would necessitate periodic reviews on any significant asset within property  plant and equipment at september  intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of ashland s reporting units  which generally are synonymous with its industry segments 
however  the individual operating divisions of performance materials and water technologies are also considered reporting units under fas since market prices of ashland s reporting units are not readily available  management makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of those units 
fair values are based principally on ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization multiples of peer group companies for each of these reporting units 
ashland did not recognize any goodwill impairment during and  and the amount recognized in was not significant 
the most recent annual impairment tests indicated that the fair values of each of ashland s reporting units with significant goodwill were in excess of their carrying values by at least except for the e ps business of water technologies acquired in may  and the consolidated fair values exceeded carrying values by approximately 
despite that excess  however  impairment charges could still be required if a divestiture decision were made with respect to a particular business included in one of the reporting units 
employee benefit obligations ashland and its subsidiaries sponsor contributory and noncontributory qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees in the united states and in a number of other countries 
benefits under these plans generally are based on employees years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding their retirement 
in addition  the companies also sponsor unfunded postretirement benefit plans  which provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees who retire or are disabled 
retiree contributions to ashland s health care m plans are adjusted periodically  and the plans contain other cost sharing features  such as deductibles and coinsurance 
life insurance plans generally are noncontributory 
as of september   ashland revised certain demographic assumptions used to determine its pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
the mortality assumption was changed from the rp table for healthy lives to the rp combined mortality table for males and females healthy lives projected to using scale aa 
in addition  the rates of turnover were revised for current active members based on actual experience of plan participants for the period through the previous rates of turnover assumption were based on actual plan experience for the years through current retirement rates are based upon actual experience 
these changes were effective as of september  for disclosure purposes and for expense 
the principal economic assumptions used to determine ashland s pension and other postretirement benefit costs are the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
because ashland s retiree health care plans contain various caps that limit ashland s contributions and because medical inflation is expected to continue at a rate in excess of these caps  the health care cost trend rate has no material impact on ashland s postretirement health care benefit costs 
beginning september   ashland developed the discount rate used to determine the present value of its obligations under the us pension and postretirement health and life plans by matching the stream of benefit payments from the plans to the citigroup pension discount curve spot rates 
ashland changed to this approach to better reflect the specific cash flows of these plans in determining the discount rate 
the discount rate determined as of september  was for the us pension plans and for the postretirement health and life plans 
non us pension plans followed a similar process based on financial markets in those countries where ashland provides a defined benefit pension plan 
the weighted average discount rate for ashland s us and us pension plans combined was as of september  previously  the discount rate for us pension plans was based on the moody s aa corporate bond index  adjusted for longer durations of the pension plans as compared to the shorter duration of the index  and also adjusted to convert the semi annual coupons in the index to an annual discount rate 
ashland s expense under both us and us pension plans is determined using the discount rate as of the beginning of the fiscal year  which amounted to a weighted average rate of for  for and for the rates used for the postretirement health and life plans were for  for and for the expense for the pension plans will be based on a weighted average discount rate of  while will be used for the postretirement health and life plans 
the weighted average rate of compensation increase assumptions were for  for and for  reflecting a rate for the us plans for all three years 
the weighted average long term expected rate of return on assets was assumed to be in  in and in  reflecting an rate for the us plans for all three years 
the return on plan assets is subject to wide year to year variances 
for  the us pension plan assets generated an actual return of  compared to in and in however  the expected return on plan assets is designed to be a long term assumption  and actual returns will be subject to considerable year to year variances 
ashland has generated compounded annual investment returns of and on its us pension plan assets over the last five year and ten year periods 
the rate of compensation increase assumption for the us plans will be reduced to and the expected return on us plan assets will be reduced to in determining ashland s pension costs for shown below are the estimated increases in pension and postretirement expense that would have resulted from a change in each of the assumptions for each of the last three years 
in millions increase in pension costs from decrease in the discount rate increase in the salary adjustment rate decrease in the expected return on plan assets increase in other postretirement costs from decrease in the discount rate income taxes ashland is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining ashland s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities 
income taxes are accounted for under fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid  currently payable or receivable  and those deferred 
under fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax m rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date changes 
valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in the ordinary course of ashland s business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
ashland is regularly under audit by tax authorities 
accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
although ashland believes it has appropriate support for the positions taken on tax returns  a liability has been recorded that represents ashland s best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions 
ashland believes that the recorded accruals for all known tax liabilities are adequate for all open years  based on the assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter 
although ashland believes the recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain 
therefore  ashland s assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
although ashland believes that the estimates and assumptions supporting its assessments are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on ashland s income tax provision  net income  or cash flows could result in the period such a determination is made 
due to the complexity involved  ashland is not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded 
asbestos related litigation ashland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
such claims result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in in connection with the sale of riley stoker corporation riley  a former subsidiary 
although riley was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos  its industrial boilers contained some asbestos containing components provided by other companies 
ashland retained hamilton  rabinovitz alschuler  inc hr a to assist in developing and periodically updating independent and accurate reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions 
the methodology used by hr a to project future asbestos costs is based largely on ashland s recent experience  including claim filing and settlement rates  disease mix  enacted legislation  open claims  and litigation defense and claim settlement costs 
ashland s claim experience is compared to the results of previously conducted epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases 
those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to asbestos 
using that information  hr a estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed  as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims 
from the range of estimates  ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs 
during the most recent update of this estimate completed during  it was determined that the reserves for asbestos claims should be increased by million 
this increase in the reserves was based on the results of a non inflated  non discounted year model developed with the assistance of hr a 
this increase resulted in total reserves for asbestos claims of million at september   compared to million at september  projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict 
in addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received  other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  ashland believes its asbestos reserve represents the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes 
as a part of the process to develop ashland s estimates of future asbestos costs  a range of long term cost models is developed 
these models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs  as well as other variables mentioned previously 
ashland has estimated that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately billion  depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models 
if actual experience is worse than projected relative to the number of claims filed  the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims  ashland may need to increase further the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could potentially be material over time 
ashland has insurance coverage for most of the litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims  and coverage in place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide substantially all of the coverage currently being accessed 
as a result  increases in the asbestos reserve have been largely offset by probable m insurance recoveries 
the amounts not recoverable generally are due from insurers that are insolvent  rather than as a result of uninsured claims or the exhaustion of ashland s insurance coverage 
ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with ashland s estimate of its asbestos liabilities 
such recoveries are based on management s assumptions and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage 
one such assumption is that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent 
although coverage limits are resolved in the coverage in place agreement with equitas limited equitas and other london companies  which collectively provide a significant portion of ashland s insurance coverage for asbestos claims  there was a disagreement with these companies over the timing of recoveries 
in estimating the value of future recoveries  ashland has historically used the least favorable interpretation of this agreement under which the ultimate recoveries are extended for many years  resulting in a significant discount being applied to value those recoveries 
on june  an arbitrator reached a decision essentially confirming that interpretation 
ashland will continue to apply this methodology based on this arbitration decision 
at september   ashland s receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to million  of which million relates to costs previously paid 
receivables from insurers amounted to million at september  the receivable was increased by million during  reflecting the updated model used for purposes of valuing the reserve described above  and its impact on the valuation of future recoveries from insurers 
about of the estimated receivables from insurance companies at september  are expected to be due from equitas and other london companies 
of the remainder  approximately is expected to come from companies or groups that are rated a or higher by a 
m 
best 
environmental remediation ashland is subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts collectively environmental remediation at multiple locations 
at september   such locations included waste treatment or disposal sites where ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under superfund or similar state laws  current and former operating facilities including certain operating facilities conveyed to map and about  service station properties  of which are being actively remediated 
ashland s reserves for environmental remediation amounted to million at september  and million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  were classified in noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the total reserves for environmental remediation reflect ashland s estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable  without regard to any third party recoveries 
engineering studies  probability techniques  historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation 
ashland regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues 
environmental remediation expense amounted to million in  million in and million in environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect ashland s ability to estimate its share of the costs 
such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site  the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations  widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods  changes in environmental regulations  the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology  and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites 
although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation  ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately million 
no individual remediation location is material to ashland  as its largest reserve for any site is less than of the remediation reserve 
outlook ashland is focused on growing as a diversified  global chemical company organically and through acquisitions 
ashland s strong financial position and balanced approach to growth should create value for its investors and deliver needed solutions to its customers 
performance materials should benefit from continued global economic growth 
in the composite polymers business  north america  europe and china are the three major  worldwide markets for unsaturated polyester resins 
although this business faces softness in the north american market  about of ashland s revenues in this business are generated outside north america 
the european market has returned to growth after a slow and china is showing good growth 
within the us market  traditional applications in the marine and residential construction segments are slowing 
certain applications  such as composite windows and doors  continue to thrive  primarily as a result of material substitution 
in addition  several other market segments remain strong specifically  the electrical  power  and infrastructure segments 
distribution s performance will be largely determined by growth of the north american economy 
ashland s focus will be on continued cost control and efforts to grow volume 
distribution benefited early in fiscal from temporary supply m disruptions  and the resultant pricing volatility that followed hurricanes katrina and rita 
distribution s ability to execute well should help it navigate through changing economic conditions 
recent developments in valvoline s market place are encouraging 
ashland s price increases and recent reductions in base lube oil costs are beginning to have a positive impact on margins 
in addition  recent cost cutting efforts have eliminated million of costs from valvoline s budget 
valvoline should return to profitability beginning with the december quarter 
the strong performance of water technologies in the september quarter is also encouraging 
recent cost cutting efforts have eliminated million of costs from this business for fiscal in addition  water technologies should benefit from its business model redesign  as well as the e ps business acquired at the end of may ashland s sales and operating revenues are normally subject to seasonal variations 
the following table compares operating income by quarter for the three years ended september   excluding refining and marketing operations  to illustrate the historical seasonality of ashland s remaining four wholly owned businesses 
amounts for each quarter do not necessarily total to results for the year due to rounding 
in millions quarterly operating income december march june september effects of inflation and changing prices ashland s financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting and  as a result  do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the us dollar 
although annual inflation rates have been low in recent years  ashland s results are still affected by the cumulative inflationary trend from prior years 
certain of the industries in which ashland operates are capital intensive  and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would exceed their historical costs 
accordingly  depreciation and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs 
however  since replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies  such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities  mitigating part of the increased expense 
ashland uses the lifo method to value a substantial portion of its inventories to provide a better matching of revenues with current costs 
however  lifo values such inventories below their replacement costs 
monetary assets such as cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivable lose purchasing power as a result of inflation  while monetary liabilities such as accounts payable and indebtedness result in a gain  because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power 
ashland s monetary assets now exceed its monetary liabilities  leaving it more exposed to the effects of future inflation than in the past  when that relationship was reversed 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis md a contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  with respect to ashland s operating performance 
these estimates are based upon a number of assumptions  including those mentioned within md a 
such estimates are also based upon internal forecasts and analyses of current and future market conditions and trends  management plans and strategies  weather  operating efficiencies and economic conditions  such as prices  supply and demand  cost of raw materials  and legal proceedings and claims including environmental and asbestos matters 
although ashland believes its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  it cannot assure the expectations reflected herein will be achieved 
this forward looking information may prove to be inaccurate and actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated if one or more of the underlying assumptions or expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized or if other unexpected conditions or events occur 
other factors and risks affecting ashland are contained in risks and uncertainties in note a of notes to consolidated financial statements and in item a of this annual report on form k 
ashland undertakes no obligation to subsequently update or revise these forward looking statements 
m item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ashland regularly uses commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its exposure to price fluctuations associated with the purchase of butane and natural gas  as well as certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows 
gains and losses related to a hedge are either recognized in income immediately to offset the gain or loss on the hedged item  or deferred and recorded in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet as a component of total comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the hedged item affects net income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a hedge is recognized in income immediately 
ashland has designated a limited portion of its foreign currency derivatives as qualifying for hedge accounting treatment  but their impact on the consolidated financial statements is not significant 
credit risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts  but exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts 
ashland further minimizes this credit risk through internal monitoring procedures and as of september  does not have significant credit risk on open derivative contracts 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in commodity prices or foreign currency rates on ashland s open commodity based and foreign currency derivative instruments at september  would not significantly affect ashland s consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or liquidity
