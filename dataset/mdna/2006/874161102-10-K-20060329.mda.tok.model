the impact from the hurricanes in the early fall season led to decreased customer demand and traffic resulting in september s sales shortfall

critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the applicable balance sheets and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the applicable reporting periods 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to inventories  product returns  customer programs and incentives  retirement plans  the allowance for doubtful accounts  and income taxes 
the estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results would differ from these estimates if actual events or experience were different from their assumptions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require its most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
however  there is no assurance that such judgments and estimates will reflect actual results or that such estimates or their underlying assumptions may not need to change materially in the future to reflect actual experience 

table of contents inventory markdown reserve 
merchandise inventory is a significant asset on the company s balance sheet  representing approximately of total assets at january  talbots manages its inventory levels by typically holding four major sale events per year in its stores and catalog  consisting of two mid season sales and two end of season clearance sales 
no other major promotional sale events are typically held 
these events serve to liquidate remaining inventory at the end of each selling season after which remaining goods are transferred to the company s outlet stores 
at the end of each reporting period  reductions in gross margin and inventory are recorded for estimated future markdowns necessary to liquidate remaining markdown inventory 
the key factors influencing the reserve calculation are the overall level of markdown inventory at the end of the reporting period and the expectation of future markdowns on this same merchandise based on historical markdown percentages 
these percentages are reviewed regularly by comparing actual markdowns taken against previous estimates 
these results are then factored into future estimates 
if market conditions were to decline or customer acceptance of product was not favorable  talbots might be required to mark down inventory at a greater rate than estimated  possibly resulting in an incremental charge to earnings 
management believes that at january  and january   the markdown reserve was reasonable based on current markdown inventory levels  historical markdown trends and reasonable sales and markdown forecasts 
sales return reserve 
as part of the normal sales cycle  the company receives customer merchandise returns through both its catalog and store locations 
to account for the financial impact of this process  management estimates future returns on previously sold merchandise 
reductions in sales and gross margin are recorded for estimated merchandise returns based on return history  current sales levels  and projected future return levels 
the sales return reserve calculation consists of two separate components 
the stores component is based on an analysis that tracks daily sales over the preceding six months and actual returns processed against those sales 
a six month rolling average return rate is applied against the actual sales and the difference between the estimated returns and actual returns is booked as a reserve 
the model also applies a component to reduce the reserve for returns that result in merchandise exchanges 
these types of returns are tracked by the store systems and the estimate is applied against the return reserve 
the direct marketing component is based on a similar process except that sales are tracked by catalog and return rates are based on forecasted estimates for the entire life of the catalog and are based on current and historical return experience 
periodically both components of the calculation are validated by comparing the assumptions used to the actual returns processed 
management believes that at january  and january   the reserve was sufficient based on current sales return trends and reasonable return forecasts 
customer loyalty program 
talbots maintains a customer loyalty program in which customers receive appreciation awards based on reaching a specified purchase level on their talbots charge accounts 
customers may redeem their appreciation awards toward future merchandise purchases on the talbots charge card 
appreciation awards  by their terms  expire one year from the date of issuance 
typically  the customer receives one point for each one dollar of purchase 
each time a customer reaches points within the program year the customer is issued a twenty five dollar appreciation award 
typically  the company runs two promotional events  in march and september  where the customer is credited two points for each one dollar purchased 
in  the company also offered this promotion in december 
appreciation award expense is calculated as a percent of talbots charge sales and is based on expected redemption rates and is charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
each month  the company performs an analysis of the accrual account balance and factors in the outstanding unredeemed awards  actual redemptions  and the level of award points earned 
the company also performs a monthly analysis of issuances and redemptions to identify trends in the redemption rate 
adjustments are made to the accrual based on trends and changes in the program 
several key statistics are monitored regularly  including expense as a percentage of sales  redemptions as a percentage of sales  and cumulative redemptions 
trends in these statistics are then factored into both the initial expense and the analysis of the liability account 

table of contents actual award grants and redemptions may vary from estimates based on actual customer responsiveness to the program and could result in additional expense 
management believes that at january  and january   its accrual was sufficient based on recent purchase levels and expected redemption levels 
retirement plans 
the company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan covering substantially all full time employees  two non qualified supplemental executive retirement plans collectively  the serp for certain key executives impacted by internal revenue code limits  and provides certain medical benefits for most retired employees under a postretirement medical plan 
in calculating its retirement plan obligations and related expense  the company makes various assumptions and estimates 
the annual determination of expense involves calculating the estimated total benefit ultimately payable to plan participants and allocates this cost to the periods in which services are expected to be rendered 
the plans are valued annually as of december st 
significant assumptions related to the calculation of the company s obligations include the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations to be paid in the future  the expected long term rate of return on assets held by the pension plan  the average rate of compensation increase by certain plan participants  and the assumed healthcare trend rates on the postretirement medical plan 
these assumptions are reviewed annually based upon currently available information 
the assumed discount rate utilized is based in part on an analysis of corporate bonds with maturities matched to the plans anticipated cash flows 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of the company s obligation and net expense 
at december  and  the discount rate used was and  respectively 
to the extent that the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s obligations are decreased or increased accordingly 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the pension obligation 
the expected average long term rate of return on assets is based principally on an analysis using ibbotson associates historical investment returns data for the two major classes of investments in which the company invests debt and equity securities 
this rate is utilized primarily in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the annual pension expense 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets is less than or more than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension expense is not affected 
rather  this loss or gain adjusts future pension expense over approximately years 
during both and  the company utilized as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees and is based on historical and expected compensation increases 
the company utilized a rate of for both the periods beginning december  and december  this rate is utilized principally in calculating the retirement obligation and annual expense 
the assumed health care expense trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the postretirement medical plan 
the healthcare cost escalation rate is used to determine the postretirement obligation and annual expense 
at december  and  the company used and  respectively  as initial cost escalation rates that gradually trend down to 
to the extent that these rates increase or decrease  the company s obligation and associated expense are increased or decreased accordingly 
at december  and  management believes that the assumptions used in the calculation of its retirement plans and postretirement medical plan liabilities were reasonable 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
customer accounts receivable consist entirely of outstanding receivables from the company s customers for their purchases made using the company s proprietary credit card 
talbots maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts providing for estimated charge offs resulting from the inability of talbots charge customers to make required payments 
delinquent accounts are generally charged off automatically after a period of delinquency 
accounts are written off sooner in the event of customer bankruptcy or other circumstances that make further collection unlikely 
increases in the allowance are charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
the likelihood of collectibility of accounts receivable is evaluated based on a combination of factors including the level of accounts receivable balances  overall credit quality of the portfolio  historic charge off levels  and projected future charge off levels 

table of contents an analytical review of accounts receivable is performed each reporting period which categorizes delinquent accounts based on the number of days overdue 
bad debt estimates  by category  are then calculated based on historical collection rates 
for accounts that are not delinquent  a bad debt rate is imputed based on historical delinquency and collection rates 
in addition  bad debts resulting from factors other than delinquency  such as bankruptcy or fraud  are also factored into the calculation based on historical experience 
existing accounts are reviewed twice a year using standard industry credit score models by an independent credit scoring agency 
an adjustment to the reserve is calculated based on movement in the portfolio s credit scores and current aging trends 
if the creditworthiness of talbots customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additions to this reserve might be required 
management believes that at january  and january   the allowance for doubtful accounts balance was reasonable in light of portfolio balance  portfolio quality  historical charge offs  and reasonable charge off forecasts 
income taxes 
the company is routinely under audit by various domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions 
in response to this  management records accruals for estimates of audit adjustments by the taxing authorities 
the eventual resolution of these audits might include increases or decreases in liabilities
