item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands except per share data results of operations overview interpharm holdings  inc  the company or interpharm  through its operating wholly owned subsidiary  interpharm  inc  interpharm  inc 
and collectively with interpharm  we or us is engaged in the business of developing  manufacturing and marketing generic prescription strength and over the counter pharmaceutical products 
we currently manufacture and market generic drug products  which represent various oral dosage strengths for unique products 
during the fiscal year ended june   we continued implementation of our expansion plan and transformation into a full service generic drug provider by committing the necessary capital  personnel and resources to do so 
pursuant to our expansion plan  our principal goals are to target higher margin products  establish full product lines in each of our product areas  obtain approvals for those products and successfully commercialize those products  while increasing production and efficiency in manufacturing and marketing our current products 
our results of operations and financial statements not only reflect our expansion and transformation  but also show that we are on the path to continuing to meet our objectives o our revenues increased by approximately  from  for the fiscal year ended june  to  for the fiscal year ended june  our significant revenue growth was driven by our expansion plan mandates the addition of new products  increasing efficiencies and a stronger marketing presence 
o our gross margins increased by approximately percentage points from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  our significant growth in our gross margins was a direct result of our mandate to add higher margin products to our line  which we were able to do with the addition of our female hormone products and generic bactrim and increasing sales of naproxen 
o we increased our research and development spending by approximately  from  for the fiscal year ended june  to  for the fiscal year ended june   and by from for the fiscal year ended june  the only way to add more products to our line is to commit research and development spending to develop the products and file andas 
we have done this  and are committed to increase the pace of our research and development spending in the coming fiscal year 
from july   to the date of this annual report  our research and development spending has resulted in the filing of new andas  and we anticipate the filing of at least an additional andas for the fiscal year ending june  as disclosed in prior filings  we had previously projected only filings by june   but are now on a pace for at least o we have started development on products in all of our five primary targeted product areas and are continuing to target and file andas for products in our sixth area products coming off patent and for which patents have expired 
each of these product areas was chosen because of the higher margins that are available and because we anticipate limited competition 
our progress to date in our targeted product areas is allowing us to move further towards our goals of having a full line to offer in each product area and further increasing gross margins and per tablet revenues 
our five primary targeted product areas are female hormone products  scheduled narcotic products  soft gelatin capsule products special release characteristic products and liquid products 
o we have obtained all of the financing we require to meet our current plan  as well as to finance additional projects which may become available to us on february   we obtained a new  credit facility from wells fargo to replace our previous  facility from hsbc  on may   we closed the sale of  of our series b convertible preferred stock and warrants  and on september   we closed the sale of  of our series c convertible preferred stock and warrants 
o we continued our hiring of qualified research and development  marketing and other personnel  including a national sales manager  so that we have most of the personnel necessary to complete our plan 
we are continuing our hiring and are adding additional research and development and marketing personnel  including a second national sales manager 
o we have increased production to over billion tablets during the fiscal year ended june  in addition  we have substantially completed the build out of our new yaphank facility which we believe will come on line by december  we anticipate further increases in our revenue per tablet to complement our production and efficiency improvements 
o we have elected to develop internally  certain research and development projects that had been previously outsourced  such as certain off patent products  to expedite development and to take advantage of our increased research and development capabilities with greater staff and space in our yaphank facility 
o we have significantly decreased contract manufacturing activities 
based upon our achievements during the past fiscal year through the addition of higher margin products and increased production  we believe that we have a solid foundation for future growth  to complete our expansion plan and to achieve profitability fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  for the fiscal year ended june  for the fiscal year ended june  sales  net cost of sales gross profit gross profit percentage operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses related party rent expense research and development total operating expenses operating loss other income expenses gain on sale of marketable securities loss on sale of fixed asset interest expense interest and other income total other expenses loss income before income taxes benefit from income taxes net loss net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended june  were  compared to  for fiscal year ended june   an increase of  or 
significant components contributing to our growth of existing products were those set forth in the table below product year over year increase in net sales ibuprofen naproxen hydrocodone ibuprofen total the increase in net sales of ibuprofen was primarily the result of an expanded customer base and improvements in manufacturing and packaging which enabled us to increase output and modest cost of materials reductions 
we believe sales of ibuprofen should remain at current levels for fiscal  however  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
an expanded customer base  as well as obtaining a us government contract to supply naproxen to various governmental agencies valued at approximately  for the twelve month period beginning september were key factors contributing to the  increase in sales of naproxen 
the contract includes four one year option periods 
we believe sales volume should continue or may increase slightly  however  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
on a fiscal year over year basis  we had an increase of more than  from sales of hydrocodone mg ibuprofen mg  our generic version of vicoprofen  which was launched during the three month period ended december   and reprexain hydrocodone mg ibuprofen mg 
both products are sold to and marketed by  watson pharmaceuticals  inc and therefore it is difficult to project future sales 
the results for the periods reported include additional revenue derived from a profit sharing arrangement for these products 
during the fiscal year ended june   we began to see the positive effects of our expansion plan which commenced in two new products were launched which contributed greatly to our revenue growth 
as we continue our planned product line expansion we anticipate that fiscal year should witness the launching of new products as well  however there can be no assurance we will be successful in achieving our plan 
the two new products for fiscal were as reported in our current report on form k filed with the sec on july   we entered into an agreement with centrix pharmaceutical  inc centrix for the sale of a female hormone product  which is distributed in two strengths 
this product generates a higher gross margin compared to our other products 
the agreement commenced upon the first shipment of the product to centrix in august  centrix was required to purchase a minimum  of the product during the first twelve month period with the option to purchase an additional  of product 
for the twelve month period ended june   we shipped approximately  of the female hormone product to centrix 
we will ship approximately  of product by september  we have renegotiated the agreement with centrix for the up coming year and we anticipate sales during fiscal of the product to exceed fiscal year totals 
in the event that the agreement is terminated at any time  or for any reason  we maintain the right to market the product alone or with a third party 
in september   we launched sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim smt single and double strength tablets  which are sold under the name bactrim 
smt is a widely used antibiotic used to treat infections such as urinary tract infections  bronchitis  ear infections otitis  traveler s diarrhea  and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia 
sales during fiscal of these products approximated  while we believe that sales of for these products should increase during fiscal  market conditions could affect our results 
as a result of our decision to greatly reduce and ultimately halt the manufacture and sale of allopurinol and atenolol under a contract manufacturing agreement  our revenues for these products declined during the fiscal year ended june  both allopurinol and atenolol were manufactured for and shipped to one customer based on quantities ordered by that customer 
revenue from sales of allopurinol and atenolol decreased by approximately  from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the manufacturing capacity gained from the decrease in production of these two products is being used for other products 
for fiscal and beyond we anticipate little or no sales of these products 
the fluctuations in revenue by product were generally not attributable to any changes in our pricing which  for our entire product line  remained relatively stable 
during the fiscal year ended june   four key customers  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of total sales 
for the fiscal year ended june  we had three key customers which accounted for approximately cost of sales gross profits during the year ended june   prices for our raw materials remained relatively constant 
while no assurance can be given  we anticipate this trend to continue  at least for the near future 
during the fiscal year ended june   prices for packaging components increased 
it is uncertain as to whether or not these costs will continue to rise 
we have incurred increased direct labor and supervisory salaries and related benefits associated with increased production 
as part of our expansion plan  we have increased managerial and production staff 
we believe this increase is required and should ultimately support our expansion plan 
additionally  incurred increased general overhead costs  such as product liability insurance  workers compensation insurance  medical benefits and utilities 
we believe these higher costs will likely continue for the near future 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended june  significantly increased by more than  or  to  compared to  for the year ended june  in addition  our gross profit percentage increased percentage points from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  this increase is primarily due to sales of our new products bactrim and our female hormone therapy products which both generate higher gross margins compared to our remaining products 
gross margins for the remaining products were generally consistent with the prior year 
gross margin percentage can fluctuate as a result of many factors  such as changes in our selling price or the cost of raw materials  as well as increases in cost of labor and general overhead 
fluctuations in our sales volume and product mix affect gross margin dollars 
as part of our plan  we are seeking to add new products with higher margins  however  there can be no assurance that sales will increase or cost of sales will not increase disproportionately 
selling and general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries and related costs  commissions  travel  administrative facilities  communications costs and promotional expenses for our direct sales and marketing staff  administrative and executive salaries and related benefits  legal  accounting and other professional fees as well as general corporate overhead 
during the fiscal year ended june   selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  to approximately  or of net sales from approximately  or of net sales  during fiscal year end june  significant factors contributing to this increase include necessary increases in the staffing of administrative and sales areas to support our growth of  related payroll taxes and benefits of  increased commission expenses and freight expenses of and  respectively  both of which are attributable to our higher sales  for investment banking services  increased accounting and legal costs of  primarily related to the refinancing of our bank debt and sale of our series b preferred stock  an increase in general insurance of  increased rent  utilities and taxes of  an increase in depreciation of non manufacturing assets of  and the recognition of a non cash charge of  as a result of our adoption of the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r 
included in the  was a non cash charge related to the modification of an option grant as a result the death of an executive officer 
adoption of sfas r requires us to report a non cash expense for the ratable portion of the fair value of employee stock option awards of unvested stock options over the remaining vesting period 
previously we elected to follow the intrinsic value method in accounting for our stock based employee compensation arrangements as defined by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations including financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
we believe that our selling and general and administrative costs should stabilize at current levels  other than for those expenses that fluctuate with sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for new products currently in development in our new product pipeline consist primarily of wages  outside development organizations  bioequivalence studies  materials  legal fees  and consulting fees 
during the fiscal year ended june  we incurred more than  in research and development expenses  which is  greater than the prior year amount of  we believe that research and development expenses  as a percentage of our net sales  will be substantially higher in the future as we seek to expand our product lines 
while we believe increased spending for research and development efforts will allow us to add obtain approvals for new products  there can be no assurance we will be successful in the commercialization 
a significant component of our expansion plan includes two agreements with tris pharma  inc tris 
one of the agreements is for the development and licensing of twenty five liquid generic products liquids agreement 
in the event that tris delivers twenty five successful technical packages  of which there can be no assurance  we will be required to pay tris  in accordance with the terms of this agreement  we make payments as various milestones are achieved 
in addition  tris is to receive a royalty of between and of net profits resulting from the sales of each product 
we are entitled to offset the royalty payable to tris each year  at an agreed upon rate  to recoup the development fees paid to tris under the liquids agreement 
the second agreement  as amended  pertains to the solid dosage products solids  pursuant to which we are to collaborate with tris on the development  manufacture and marketing of eight solid oral dosage generic products 
the amendment to this agreement requires tris to deliver technical packages for two softgel products 
further  the terms of this amendment require us pay to tris based upon various tris milestone achievements 
some products included in this agreement  as amended  may require us to challenge the patents for the equivalent branded products 
this agreement  as amended  provides for payments of an aggregate of  to tris  whether or not regulatory approval is obtained for any of the solids products 
the agreement for solids also provides for an equal sharing of net profits for each product  except for one product  if it is successfully sold and marketed  after the deduction and reimbursement of all litigation related and certain other costs 
the excluded product provides for a profit split of for the company and for tris 
further  this agreement provides us with a perpetual royalty free license to use all technology necessary for the solid products in the united states  its territories and possessions 
in april   the solids agreement was further amended 
this second amendment requires tris to deliver a technical package for one additional solid dosage product 
further  terms of this second amendment will requires us to pay to tris an additional after it has paid the initial aggregate amounts associated to the original agreement 
for the fiscal year ended june   we recorded as a research and development expense approximately  in connection with these agreements 
further  since inception  we have incurred approximately  of research and development costs associated with the tris agreements 
the combined costs of these agreements could aggregate up to  the balance on the liquid agreement of  could be paid within three years if all milestones are reached 
the balance on the solids agreement  as amended  of  could be paid within two years if all milestones are reached 
during the fiscal year ended june   we filed andas 
we believe that with our increased research and development spending  we will be able to file andas at an increasing rate and anticipate exceeding our previous projection of twenty five andas for the period july  through june  we are currently negotiating a possible modification to the tris liquids agreement which could outsource the manufacturing of these liquid products to tris 
interest expense our interest expense increased approximately to approximately for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june  in an effort to fund our plan  in february   we increased our borrowing capabilities through a new credit facility entered into with wells fargo business credit 
the additional borrowings were required primarily to fund our research and development efforts  for renovation and construction costs incurred for our second facility and new equipment 
in order to hedge against rising interest rates  we entered into two interest rate swap arrangements 
as of june   we have saved approximately as a result of these swaps agreements 
however  it is likely that  as a result of additional borrowings we will incur increases in our interest expense in the future 
operating loss although our sales and gross margins increased  as a result of our increase in research and development efforts from which we believe we will see the benefits from in the future  along with increases in selling and general and administrative costs  we incurred an operating loss of  for the year ended june  compared to an operating loss of for the year ended june  income taxes for the year ended june  we recorded an income tax benefit of  an increase in the benefit of  compared to the year ended june  which had a benefit from income tax of we account for income taxes using the liability method which requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse 
the net deferred tax asset is adjusted by a valuation allowance  if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our net deferred tax asset at june  was  and  at june  liquidity and capital resources we currently finance our operations and capital expenditures through cash flows from operations  bank loans and sale of preferred stock 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended june   was compared to cash used in operating activities of  during the fiscal year ended june  significant factors comprising the cash provided in operating activities include net loss of  increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses payable of  an increase in deferred revenue of  offset by decreases of  in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other payables are primarily attributable to increases in purchases due to greater sales volume as well as increased research and development costs 
additionally  we reported depreciation and amortization of  at june   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  compared to at june  we also recognized a non cash charge of  as a result of adoption of sfas r 
significant components in our net cash provided by financing activities of  for the fiscal year ended june   were the our entering into new credit facility of  canceling a previous credit facility of  the details of which is detailed below and the sale of  of our series b redeemable convertible preferred stock 
a component of our current plan is the completion of renovations to our second facility along with the installation of additional equipment for manufacturing  packaging and research and development 
accordingly  during the fiscal year ended june  we invested  for new equipment and improvements 
in addition  on september  we sold  of our series c redeemable convertible preferred stock it should be noted that as part of our business plan  during the fiscal year ended june   we incurred more than  in research and development expenses 
we believe that our research and development costs will likely exceed this current rate  for the foreseeable future 
as previously disclosed we have elected not to move forward with the planned construction of a research and development facility in ahmedabad  india 
we are currently investigating our options pertaining to the land acquired 
we are continuing development and capital investment in our new yaphank  ny facility which already houses some of our expanded research and development department and will also be used for manufacturing 
we believe the yaphank facility will be operational by the end of calendar bank financing on february   we entered into a new four year financing arrangement with wells fargo business credit wfbc 
this financing agreement provided a maximum credit facility of  comprised of  revolving credit facility  real estate term loan  machinery and equipment m e term loan  additional future capital expenditure facility the funds made available through this facility paid down  in its entirety  the million owed on the previous credit facility 
the new revolving credit facility borrowing base is calculated as i of our eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of of cost or of the net orderly liquidation value of its eligible inventory 
the advances pertaining to inventory are capped at the lesser of of the advance from accounts receivable or  the  loan for the real estate in yaphank  ny is payable in equal monthly installments of plus interest through february at which time the remaining principal balance is due 
the  m e loan is payable in equal monthly installments of plus interest through february at which time the remaining principal balance is due 
with respect to additional capital expenditures  the company is permitted to borrow of the cost of new equipment purchased to a maximum of  in borrowings amortized over months 
as of june   there is approximately  available for additional capital expenditure borrowings 
under the terms of the wfbc agreement  three stockholders  all related to our chairman of the board of directors  one of whom is our chief operating officer  were required to provide limited personal guarantees  as well as pledge securities with a minimum aggregate value of  as security for a portion of the  credit facility 
we were required to raise a minimum of  through the sale of equity or subordinated debt by june  the shareholder s pledges of marketable securities would be reduced by wfbc either upon our raising capital  net of expenses in excess of  or achieving certain milestones 
as a result of our sale of  of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock in may  the credit facility and the limited personal guarantees were reduced by  and  respectively 
further  in september  we consummated a  sale of series c redeemable convertible preferred stock which will further reduce the credit facility by  and eliminate the balance of the personal pledges of marketable securities of  after the reductions described above  the maximum availability of the revolving credit facility will be the revolving credit facility and term loans will bear interest at a rate of the prime rate less or  at our option  libor plus basis points 
at june   the interest rate on this debt was 
pursuant to the requirements of the wfbc agreement  we put in place a lock box arrangement 
we will incur a fee of basis points per annum on any unused amounts of this credit facility 
the wfbc credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
in addition  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants 
with respect to the real estate term loan and the million m e loan  we entered into interest rate swap contracts the swaps  whereby we pay a fixed rate of and per annum  respectively 
the swaps contracts mature in the swaps are a cash flow hedge ie a hedge against interest rates increasing 
as all of the critical terms of the swaps and loans match  they are structured for short cut accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and by definition  there is no hedge ineffectiveness or a need to reassess effectiveness 
fair value of the interest rate swaps at june  was approximately and is included in other assets 
as previously disclosed  we entered into agreements with tris for the development and delivery of over thirty new technical packages 
the combined costs of these two agreements will approximate  of which we have paid  as of june  the balance on one agreement of  could be paid within two years 
the second agreement has a balance of  and is scheduled to be paid within two years 
future cash flows could be aided by utilization of our available federal net operating loss carryforwards nols 
at june  we have remaining federal nols of approximately  and state nols of approximately  expiring through pursuant to section of the internal revenue code regarding substantial changes in our ownership  utilization of these nols is limited 
approximately  of these nols are available in fiscal  and utilization of approximately  of these nols is limited and becomes available after fiscal the limitations lapse at the rate of  per year  through fiscal as of june   we determined that it is more likely than not  that we will utilize all of the federal nols in the future 
we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately of the state nols which we do not anticipate utilizing due to state limitations 
in addition  at june   we have approximately of new york state investment tax credit carryforwards  expiring in various years through these carryforwards are available to reduce future new york state income tax liabilities 
however  we reserved of the investment tax credit carryforward  which we do not anticipate utilizing 
we believe with the funds obtained from the sale of series b and series c convertible preferred stocks  along with the credit facility currently in place we should have sufficient funding for the next twelve months and to achieve our current business and expansion plan 
in the unlikely event the current funding is insufficient to implement our expansion plan we would be required to raise additional capital through either additional debt financing or through additional equity investments  the availability of which cannot be assured 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds  we will have to either delay or scale back on our expansion plan 
however  we do not believe our existing business would be materially adversely affected by such delay or scaling back of our expansion plans 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable at june  was  as compared to  at june  the average annual turnover ratio of accounts receivable to net sales for the fiscal years ended june  and was and turns  respectively 
our turns are calculated on an annual average 
our accounts receivable continue to have minimal risk with respect to bad debts  however this trend cannot be assured 
inventory at june   our inventory was  as compared to  at june  our turnover of inventory for the years ended june  and was and  respectively 
our inventory is current  there are no reserves for obsolescence 
we anticipate our inventory levels to rise in order to support future planned growth and overall customer demands 
accounts payable our accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased by approximately  to  at june   from  at june  the increase is primarily attributable to increases in purchases of our raw materials due to greater sales volume as well as increased research and development costs 
additionally  the increase is partially due to liabilities incurred in relation to fixed asset additions and construction in progress 
we do not believe this increase in our accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities will have any material affect on our vendor relationships 
cash during the year ended june   cash increased from at june  to  at june  for the year ended june  we funded our business from bank debt  operations and sale of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock

significant components aggregating to this decrease were i a decrease in sales of allopurinol and atenolol of  to  for the year ended june  compared to sales of  during the year ended june   ii partially offset by increases in sales of hydrocodone bitartrate with ibuprofen  and prednisone aggregating approximately  and iii revenue from the sale of naproxen decreased by approximately  on a year over year basis 
revenue for the products discussed in i and ii above were generated through a manufacturing and supply agreement with a significant customer 
as such we were unable to control the revenue for these products 
the fluctuations in revenue by product were not attributable to any changes in pricing which  for our entire product line  remained relatively stable 
during the fiscal year ended june   three key customers  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of total sales 
the same three customers accounted for approximately for the fiscal year ended june  we had already entered into an agreement with centrix for the sale of our first female hormone product 
that agreement commenced upon the first shipment of the product to centrix in august  and has a ten year term but  under certain circumstances  may be terminated by centrix at any time after the first year of the agreement s term 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  centrix was required to purchase a minimum  of the product during the first year of the agreement s term 
there are also additional annual minimum purchase requirements after the first year of the agreement s term for so long as the agreement remains in effect 
in the event that the agreement is terminated at any time  or for any reason  we maintain the right to market the product alone or with a third party 
in september   we launched sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim smt single and double strength tablets  which are sold under the name bactrim 
smt is a widely used antibiotic used to treat infections such as urinary tract infections  bronchitis  ear infections otitis  traveler s diarrhea  and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia 
we have already entered into a number of sales contracts for smt and shipments have commenced 
gross profit cost of sales gross profit for the fiscal year ended june  decreased approximately  or  to  compared to  for the year ended june  in addition  our gross profit percentage decreased percentage points from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june cost of sales decreased approximately or to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june   primarily due to decreased production and sales 
however  it increased as a percentage of net sales primarily as a result of i higher labor costs resulting from increased staffing  labor rates and payroll taxes and ii increases in insurance  depreciation and factory supplies 
during the year ended june   prices for our raw materials remained relatively constant 
however  as a result of recent weather economic factors  we anticipated that some of the raw materials and packaging components would likely increase in the near future 
research and development during the fiscal year ended june   particularly during the period january  through june  our research and development efforts increased significantly 
we expensed approximately during the fiscal year ended june  during the first six months of fiscal we expensed however during the six month period ended june  our research and development efforts expanded approximately seven fold to approximately  or  for the full year ended june  research and development expenses were primarily for materials  wages and bioequivalence studies for new drugs currently in development 
we believed that research and development expenses would represent a substantially larger percentage of our net sales in the future as we seek to expand our product line 
as previously discussed in february we  entered into two agreements with tris for the development and licensing of up to twenty five immediate release liquid generic products and seven solid oral dosage generic pharmaceutical products 
in the event that tris delivers twenty five products under the liquids agreement  of which there can be no assurance  tris was to receive approximately  in development fees from us and  in addition  tris was to receive a royalty of between and of net profits resulting from the sales of each product 
we are entitled to offset the royalty payable to tris each year  at an agreed upon rate  to recoup the development fees paid to tris under the liquids agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the solids agreement  as amended  we and tris are to collaborate on the development  manufacture and marketing of eight solid oral dosage generic products and two soft gel products  some of which may require us to challenge the patents for the equivalent branded products 
the solids agreement  as amended by the first amendment provided for payments of an aggregate of  to tris 
the solids agreement  as amended  also provides for an equal sharing of net profits for all but one product that is successfully sold and marketed  after the deduction and reimbursement to us of all costs incurred by us in the development and marketing of the solid products  including the amounts paid to tris under the contract 
the other product provides for a profit split of for us and for tris 
as we develop our research and development capabilities  the tris agreements allowed us to bring in house several specialized technologies which would otherwise not be available to us  and which can allow us to manufacture and sell more higher margin and profitable products 
during the year ended june   we recorded and paid  to tris 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the fiscal year end june  or of net sales  an increase of or percentage points over the prior year total of  and of net sales 
major components of our selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  included payroll taxes and benefits  selling commissions  freight expenses  legal and accounting  insurance expense and professional fees of significant factors contributing to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses are i salaries  including payroll taxes and benefits increased from the fiscal year ended june  primarily due to additions during the year of a new chief executive officer  as well as two other senior level executives  ii utilities increased  iii investor relations listing fees increased and iv professional fees  rents and licenses aggregating we believed that general and administrative costs would likely increase during the next fiscal year as a result of our second facility becoming operational 
further  we anticipated that selling expenses  specifically commissions will increase as a result of the anticipated increases in net sales 
in december  the fasb finalized sfas no 
r share based payment which will require us to expense stock options based on grant date fair value in its financial statements beginning the first quarter of fiscal as such  in future periods we will be reporting the non cash compensation expense 
interest expense our interest expense increased approximately primarily as a result of increased borrowings to fund the yaphank location renovations and well as purchase necessary new equipment 
it is likely that  as a result of additional borrowings and higher interest rates  we will incur increases in our interest expense 
operating income as a result of our increase in research and development efforts described above from which we believe we will see the benefits from in the future  along with an increase in selling and general and administrative costs and a modest decrease in net sales  we incurred an operating loss of for the year ended june  compared to an operating income of  for the year ended june  income taxes for the year ended june  we recorded an income tax benefit of a decrease in income taxes of  compared to the year ended june  income tax expense of  liquidity and capital resources we financed our operations and capital expenditures through cash flows from operations and bank loans 
as a result of our research and development efforts  we incurred a net loss for the fiscal year ended june  of approximately net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended june  was  as compared to cash provided by operations of  for the year ended june  significant factors comprising the cash used in operating activities include increases in inventories  accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets of  and  respectively 
the increase in inventories is primarily a result of a new product launches scheduled for early in fiscal as well as necessary increases to support our customers requirements 
offsetting the above uses of cash are increases in accounts and accrued expenses payable and depreciation and amortization of  and  respectively 
other items affecting our net cash used in operating activities aggregated bank lines of credit on march   we obtained a  credit facility from hsbc 
the new credit facility consists of i a  mortgage loan for the purchase of our second manufacturing plant in yaphank  new york last year  ii  of credit lines primarily to acquire new equipment and for renovations  and iii a  general line of credit 
details of the new facility are as follows the  mortgage loan is to be repaid with monthly principal installments of commencing on august  with the balance due june two advised secured credit lines aggregating  primarily for acquisitions of equipment and for renovations of our plant 
the balance of the funds accessed through these credit lines will convert into fully amortizing month term loans 
a  advised non revolving secured facility for equipment purchases 
each advance cannot exceed of the invoice amount of the new equipment and is convertible into fully amortizing month term loans 
the  advised secured line of credit is primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes 
this credit facility was collateralized by substantially all assets of the company 
at our option interest will be calculated at i libor plus per annum pa for to month periods  or at ii the bank s then fixed prime rate 
as of june   the interest rates on the working capital lines range from pa to pa and interest on the mortgage loan was pa 
on july   the mortgage loan interest rate increased to pa and will be recalculated at december  the bank will review the new credit facility annually  the next review is scheduled to occur no later than november  the credit lines are terminable by the bank at any time as to undrawn amounts 
in addition  we are required to comply with certain financial covenants  and as of june   we were in default of three financial covenants 
we obtained a waiver from the bank 
in addition to the outstanding borrowings at june   we had approximately outstanding under advised letters of credit 
as a result  at june   we had approximately  available for future borrowings 
during fiscal  the company and hsbc informally agreed to consolidate the four credit lines into one advised credit line totaling  as a result  the  of advances had not been allocated to each individual credit line 
because the company and the bank had not determined the amount of loans that are available to be converted into month term loans  the entire advised credit facility was classified as current 
as previously disclosed  we entered into agreements with tris for the development and delivery of over thirty new technical packages 
the combined costs of these two agreements will approximate  of which we have paid  as of june  the balance on one agreement of  could be paid within three years 
the second agreement has a balance of  and is scheduled to be paid within two years 
future cash flows could be aided by utilization of our available federal net operating loss carryforwards nols 
at june  the company had remaining federal nols of approximately  and state nols of approximately  expiring through pursuant to section of the internal revenue code regarding substantial changes in company ownership  utilization of these nols is limited 
approximately  of these nol s are available in fiscal  and utilization of  of these nol s is limited and becomes available after fiscal the limitations lapse at the rate of  per year  through fiscal in order to finance our expansion plan  we were utilizing our  advised line of credit obtained from hsbc bank 
we will have to spend a significant amount of money on research and development to continue our expansion plan and have already begun to do so 
while we continued to rely on this advised credit line  continuing with our expansion plan will be dependent on our ability to raise additional capital through either additional debt financing or through an equity investment  the availability of which cannot be assured 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds  we will have to either delay or scale back on our expansion plan 
however  we do not believe our existing business would be materially adversely affected by such delay or scaling back of our expansion plans 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable at june  was  as compared to  at june  the average annual turnover ratio of accounts receivable to net sales for the fiscal years ended june  and was and turns  respectively 
as our turns are calculated on an annual average  the decrease is primarily the result of credit terms for new larger customers as well as when sales are recognized during the periods 
our accounts receivable continue to have minimal risk with respect to bad debts  however this trend cannot be assured 
inventory at june   our inventory was  as compared to  at june  we believe the increase in inventory is necessary in order to maintain our future planned growth and overall customer demands 
our turnover of inventory for the years ended june  and was and  respectively 
our inventory is current  there are no reserves for obsolescence 
accounts payable accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  in the aggregate  increased approximately  to  at june  from  at june   primarily attributable to the increase in inventory 
cash and cash equivalents during the year ended june   cash and cash equivalents decreased  from  at june  to at june   primarily  among other factors i net uses of cash for components of working capital of  iii cash used for the acquisition of new machinery  equipment  renovations and enhancements of the facility in yaphank  ny  aggregating  and iii investment in apr  llc of  offset by funds received from i net bank borrowings of  ii proceeds from the exercise of stock options of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that interpharm make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  interpharm evaluates judgments and estimates made  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  income taxes and contingencies including litigation 
interpharm bases its judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing its financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition we recognize product sales revenue upon the shipment of product  when estimated provisions for chargebacks and other sales allowances are reasonably determinable  and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions to revenues 
accounts receivable are presented net of allowances relating to the above provisions 
we purchase raw materials from two suppliers  which are manufactured into finished goods and sold back to such suppliers as well as to other customers 
we can and do purchase raw materials from other suppliers 
pursuant to emerging issues task force  eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we recorded sales to  and purchases from  these suppliers on a gross basis 
sales and purchases were recorded on a gross basis since we i has a risk of loss associated with the raw materials purchased  ii converts the raw material into a finished product based upon our specifications  iii has other sources of supply of the raw material  and iv has credit risk related to the sale of such product to the suppliers 
these factors among others  qualify us as the principal under the indicators set forth in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal vs 
net as an agent 
if the terms and substance of the arrangement change  such that we no longer qualify to report these transactions on a gross reporting basis  our net income and cash flows would not be affected 
however  our sales and cost of sales would both be reduced by a similar amount 
these purchase and sales transactions are recorded at fair value in accordance with eitf issue accounting for purchase and sales of inventory with the same counterparty 
sales incentives in the current year we offered a sales incentive to one of our customers in the form of an incentive volume price adjustment 
we account for sales incentives in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of vendor s products eitf 
the terms of this volume based sales incentive require the customer to purchase a minimum quantity of our products during a specified period of time 
the incentive offered is based upon a fixed dollar amount per unit sold to the customer 
we made an estimate of the ultimate amount of the incentive the customer will earn based upon past history with the customer and other facts and circumstances 
we have the ability to estimate this volume incentive price adjustment  as there does not exist a relatively long period of time for the particular adjustment to be earned 
any change in the estimated amount of the volume incentive is recognized immediately using a cumulative catch up adjustment 
in accordance with eitf  we record the provision for this sales incentive when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrual for sales incentives at june  was approximately  and reported as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
our sales incentive liability may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for these arrangements 
therefore  although we make a best estimate of its sales incentive liability  many factors  including significant unanticipated changes in the purchasing volume of its customer  could have significant impact on our liability for sales incentives and our reported operating results 
inventory our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials and manufacturing 
we continually evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when factors such as expiration dates and spoilage indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories carrying value or the inventories are disposed of and completely written off in the period incurred 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method which requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which differences are expected to reverse 
the net deferred tax asset is adjusted by a valuation allowance  if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our net deferred tax asset at june  was  and  at june  research and development pursuant to sfas no 
accounting for research and development costs  research and development costs are expensed as incurred or at the date payment of non refundable amounts become due  whichever occurs first 
research and development costs  which consist of salaries and related costs of research and development personnel  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  raw materials used specifically in the development of its new products and bioequivalence studies 
pre approved milestone payments due under contract research and development arrangements are expensed when the milestone is achieved 
stock based compensation effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no

 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 

we did not recognize stock based compensation cost in its statement of operations for periods prior to july  as all options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
accounts receivable and chargebacks accounts receivable are comprised of amounts owed to us through the sales of its products throughout the united states 
these accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and customer chargebacks 
allowances for doubtful accounts were approximately and at june  and june   respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified accounts in addition to an overall aging analysis 
judgments are made with respect to the collectibility of accounts receivable based on historical experience and current economic trends 
actual losses could differ from those estimates 
allowances for customer chargebacks were  and at june  and june   respectively 
we sell some of its products indirectly to various government agencies referred to below as indirect customers 
we enter into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products 
the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these agreed upon prices 
we will provide credit to the selected wholesaler for the difference between the agreed upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price if the price sold to the indirect customer is lower than the direct price to the wholesaler 
this credit is called a chargeback 
the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell through levels by our wholesale customers to the indirect customers  and estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
as sales to the large wholesale customers increase  the reserve for chargebacks will also generally increase 
however  the size of the increase depends on the product mix 
we continually monitor the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments to the reserve as deemed necessary 
actual chargebacks may differ from estimated reserves
