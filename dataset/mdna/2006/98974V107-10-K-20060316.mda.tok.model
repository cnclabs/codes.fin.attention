this discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including but not limited to those set forth in risk factors in item a of part i of this report and elsewhere in this report 
we undertake no obligation to update any information contained in these forward looking statements 
overview general we are a full service residential real estate brokerage firm  using the internet  proprietary technology and efficient business processes to provide home buyers and sellers with high quality service and value 
our solution includes a client centric business approach  a sophisticated website that empowers home buyers and sellers with relevant information  a proprietary business management technology platform and significant financial savings for consumers 
we share a portion of our commissions with our buyer clients in the form of a cash rebate  and typically represent our seller clients at fee levels below those offered by most traditional brokerage companies in our markets 
generally  our seller clients pay a total brokerage fee of to of the transaction value  of which to is paid to agents representing buyers 
our net revenues are comprised primarily of commissions earned as agents for buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions 
we record revenues net of rebate or commission discount  if any  paid or offered to our clients 
we also receive revenues from certain co marketing arrangements  such as our relationship with e loan  inc  which provides the mortgage center on our website and pays us a flat monthly fee that is established on a periodic basis 
generally  non commission revenues represent less than of our net revenues during any period 
our net revenues are principally driven by the number of transactions we close and the average net revenue per transaction 
average net revenue per transaction is a function of the home sales price and percentage commission we receive on each transaction 
we were founded in  currently have operations in major metropolitan areas  and as of december  employed  people  of whom  were zipagents 
we commenced operations in las vegas in april  in houston in june  in miami  florida in october and in tampa  florida in february we currently plan to open three to five additional markets later in the year 
trends in our business our business has experienced rapid growth since our inception in  primarily as a result of increased transaction volume and increased average net revenue per transaction 
in  we generated million in net revenues  compared to million in and million in the number of our closed transactions increased from approximately  in to approximately  in to approximately 
table of contents  in  and our average net revenue per transaction increased from approximately  in to approximately  in to approximately  in our transaction volume is primarily driven by the number of zipagents we employ  which increased from at december  to at december  to  at december  our average net revenue per transaction increased over this time primarily as a result of increasing home prices and a reduction in our rebate paid to buyers 
as we add additional zipagents  we believe we will continue to increase our transaction volume and grow our business 
in order to help agents become productive more quickly  we intend to hire agents who already work for competing brokerage firms in our existing markets 
by hiring those established agents who we anticipate will be successful within our business model  we believe we can increase our transaction volume without materially diluting the number of potential transactions per agent allowing us to further increase our market share 
in addition  we believe that customer acquisition is one of our core competencies  and while we anticipate that the difficulty of acquiring a sufficient number of leads online may increase over time  we expect that we can mitigate some of that impact with repeat and referral business  as well as by increasing our visibility and credibility to potential clients over time 
since our market share has averaged less than over the past twelve months in our existing markets in aggregate  we believe that there is significant opportunity to increase our market share and grow our revenues  even if the overall level of sales decline due to changing consumer sentiment  interest rate increases or other economic or geopolitical factors 
however  we anticipate the pace of our growth in percentage terms to slow as our company increases in size 
since early september of we have experienced a significant increase in the available inventory of homes for sale in many of our markets  as well as an increase in the amount of time listings are taking to sell 
pricing increases have also slowed  and some markets have shown declines in median selling prices over this period 
according to nar  nationally sales of existing homes fell year over year in january to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of million  the lowest in nearly two years 
this represented the fifth month in a row that sales have declined 
moreover  inventory of unsold homes is the largest since august of in the state of california  the california association of realtors reported that sales of existing homes declined year over year during the month of january in our opinion  these data points suggest the housing market is in a period of transition  with more power shifting to buyers from sellers 
while over the long term we believe a more balanced market will be beneficial to our model  which relies primarily on representing buyers  during this period of transition we may continue to experience reduced growth rates and agent productivity versus our historical levels as buyers react cautiously to perceived changing market conditions 
over time  we have made significant adjustments to our cost structure and revenue model in order to improve the financial results of our business 
we have modified the compensation and expense reimbursement structure for zipagents over time  most recently in february currently  our zipagents earn a compensation package consisting of a percentage of the commissions they generate for us that ranges from to of our net revenues after deducting certain other items 
we also provide our zipagents with health  retirement and other benefits  and pay for certain marketing costs and other business expenses 
zipagents may also be granted equity incentives based on performance 
we currently believe that our most recent modifications will not materially impact our operating margins 
we may make further modifications to our compensation structure in the future 
we have lowered our buyer rebate percentage several times to improve our revenue model 
in march  we reduced our buyer rebate to of our commission from of our commission  up to a maximum of of the home sales price 
the effect of the buyer rebate reduction was recognized over a phase in period of approximately two to four months as the reduction only affected new clients immediately while existing clients continued under the prior rebate policy for transactions already in progress and for transactions opened within a short period after the reduction was announced 
we implemented these buyer rebate percentage reductions for several reasons  including our determination that our growing reputation for superior service allowed us not to compete solely on price  our efforts to improve our revenue model and agent compensation model  and our desire to offer a simplified rebate structure to our clients 

table of contents we achieved profitability for the first time in the third quarter of and maintained profitability for the fourth quarter as well  primarily as a result of increased transaction volume  higher average net revenue per transaction and improved management of discretionary expenses 
however  as a result of the seasonality to which our business is subject  we again experienced a net loss in the first quarter of we returned to profitability in the second  third and fourth quarters of  primarily as a result of higher average net transaction revenue and increased transactional volume due to our increased zipagent force and seasonal factors 
we achieved profitability in the first quarter of  the first time in our seasonally slow first quarter  primarily as a result of higher average net transaction revenues and increased transactional volume due to our increased zipagent force 
while we experienced a net loss in the second quarter of as a result of a one time charge relating to the settlement of a threatened class action lawsuit  we would have been profitable excluding the effect of this settlement 
we again achieved profitability in the third and fourth quarters of  but because of seasonality as well as the current softening in the residential real estate market  we expect to experience a net loss in the first quarter of over the past several years there has been a decline in average commissions charged in the real estate brokerage industry  in part due to companies such as ours exerting downward pressure on prices with a lower commission structure  as well as by what  in our view  appears to be an increase in consumer willingness to negotiate fees with their agents 
we believe that many consumers are focusing on absolute commission dollars paid to sell their home as opposed to accepting a traditional standard market commission percentage 
according to real trends  while the average commission percentage decreased from in to in  total commission revenues increased from billion to billion during that same period  influenced by steadily increasing sales volumes and higher median sales prices 
in the event that commissions continue to decline  we have designed our business model around an attractive cost structure and operational efficiencies which we believe should allow us to continue to offer our services at prices less than those charged by the majority of our competitors 
market seasonality  cyclicality and interest rate influences the residential real estate brokerage market is influenced both by annual seasonality factors  as well as by overall economic cycles 
while individual markets vary  transaction volume activity nationally tends to progressively increase from january through the summer months  then gradually slows over the last three to four months of the calendar year 
revenues in each quarter are significantly affected by activity during the prior quarter  given the typical to day time lag between contract execution and closing 
while we believe that seasonality has been somewhat masked by our overall growth  we have been  and believe we will continue to be  influenced by overall market activity and seasonal forces 
we generally experience the most significant impact in the first and fourth quarters of each year  when our revenues are typically lower relative to the second and third quarters as a result of traditionally slower home sales activity and reduced listings inventory between thanksgiving and presidents day 
we believe that the overall macroeconomic environment and periodic business cycles can influence the general health of the residential real estate market at any given point in time 
generally  when economic times are fair or good  the housing market tends to perform well 
if the economy is weak  interest rates dramatically increase  or there are market events such as terrorist attacks or threats  the outbreak of war or geopolitical uncertainties  the housing market could be negatively impacted 
over the past several decades  the national residential real estate market has demonstrated significant growth  with annual existing home sales volume growing from million in to approximately million in and median existing home sales prices increasing every year during that period 
during that period  the volume of existing home sales has declined for at least two consecutive years only twice  namely through and through the declines in sales volumes in the through period occurred while interest rates were at historic highs  with long term us treasury rates exceeding 
with rates remaining at similarly high levels  housing activity expanded during the period from through average interest rates were lower during the second period of consecutive year declines  through  than in 
table of contents many factors influence an individual s decision to buy or sell a home  and we believe that no one factor alone determines the health of the residential real estate market 
for example  while a rise in interest rates could lead to lower demand for housing or put downward pressure on prices  it is our experience that lifestyle influences  such as job relocation  changes in family dynamics or a desire to change neighborhoods  significantly impact the demand for residential real estate 
in addition  periods of interest rate increases are often characterized by improving economic fundamentals  which can create jobs  increase incomes and bolster consumer confidence  all of which are factors that positively influence housing demand 
it is difficult to predict which influences will be strongest  and ultimately whether the housing market will be affected positively or negatively when faced with numerous influences 
while we do not believe that increasing interest rates will necessarily have a negative impact on the housing market  increasing interest rates may lead to a lower demand for housing or put downward pressure on prices 
higher interest rates could increase monthly housing payments or reduce the amount an individual can pay  which may have an adverse effect on pricing and affordability 
it is also possible that home ownership rates  which reached an all time high in during the recent period of record low interest rates  could drop as a result of fewer first time buyers being able to afford homes 
should overall transaction activity or sales prices decline  overall commissions generated in the industry could decline as well  potentially causing the roughly billion in annual commissions generated in to decline 
however  should the addressable market for our services decline somewhat due to decreasing sales volume or prices  we believe the overall size of the market on an absolute basis will remain very large  providing ample addressable opportunity for us to continue to grow our business through increasing our market share 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our financial statements  and of those policies  we believe that the following accounting policies involve the greatest degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we derive the substantial majority of our revenues from commissions earned as agents for buyers and sellers in residential real estate transactions 
we recognize commission revenues upon closing of a sale and purchase transaction  net of any rebate or commission discount  or transaction fee adjustment  as evidenced by the closure of the escrow or similar account and the transfer of these funds to all appropriate parties 
we recognize non commission revenues from our other business relationships  such as our e loan marketing relationship  as the fees are earned from the other party typically on a monthly fee basis 
revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and the transaction has been completed 
internal use software and website development costs we account for internal use software and website development costs  including the development of our zipagent platform  in accordance with the guidance set forth in statement of position  accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and emerging task force issue no 
 accounting for website development costs 
we capitalize the payroll and direct payroll related costs of employees who devote time to the development of internal use software 
we amortize these costs over their estimated useful lives  which is generally months 
our judgment is required in determining the point at which various projects enter the stages at which costs may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of 
table of contents the capitalized costs  and in determining the estimated useful lives over which the costs are amortized 
the estimated life is based on management s judgment as to the product life cycle

 accounting for stock based compensation transaction and disclosure 
under apb  compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant  between the fair value of our stock and the exercise price of the option 
we amortize deferred stock based compensation using the straight line method over the vesting period 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas and emerging task force issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services

revised  share based payment  or sfas r  and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
effective with annual periods beginning after june   we will account for employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas r and sab which requires companies to expense the value of employee stock options and similar awards 
we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective method 
we will apply the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a ratable basis over the requisite service period 
the accounting for and disclosure of employee and non employee equity instruments  primarily stock options and preferred and common stock warrants  requires judgment by management on a number of assumptions  including the fair value of the underlying instrument  estimated lives of the outstanding instruments  and the instrument s volatility 
changes in key assumptions will impact the valuation of such instruments 
because there was no public market for our stock prior to our initial public offering in november  our board of directors determined the fair value of our common and preferred stock based on several factors  including  but not limited to  our operating and financial performance  recent sales of convertible debt instruments and internal valuation analyses considering key terms and rights of the related instruments 
we have issued warrants primarily in relation to our convertible debt arrangements  and to a lesser degree  to certain service providers 
amounts recorded in conjunction with our convertible debt arrangements are generally amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the debt using the effective interest method 
for options granted after our initial public offering  the fair value of our common stock is the closing price of our stock on the nasdaq national market on the date the option was granted 
for options which were granted prior to our initial public offering  the deemed fair value of our common stock was determined by our board of directors  with input from management  utilizing the market approach  considering a number of factors  including  but not limited to comparable values of similar companies and the pricing of recent rounds of financing  revenue growth and profitability milestones achieved and as measured to budget  continued growth in experience of our management team  marketplace activity and competition  barriers to entry  and status of capital markets 

table of contents we recorded deferred stock based compensation of  million and million and amortization of such deferred compensation of approximately   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
had different assumptions or criteria been used to determine the deemed fair value of the stock options  materially different amounts of stock compensation expenses could have been reported 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial statements as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax amounts are determined by using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received  as provided under current tax law 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable  respectively  for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
historically  we have recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  the majority of which relate to net operating loss tax carryforwards generated before we achieved profitability 
during the fourth quarter  we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefit of a significant portion of these deferred tax assets in the future 
consequently  we recognized a net tax benefit of million resulting primarily from the release of a significant portion of the net deferred tax valuation allowance 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to offset future taxable income 
if not utilized  the federal and state net operating losses will begin to expire in for federal and for state tax purposes  respectively 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership 
we have federal and state net operating losses of approximately million at december  that are subject to annual limitations of  the difference between our effective income tax rate and the federal statutory rate is primarily a function of the release of the valuation allowance provided against the net deferred tax assets and permanent differences 
our future effective income tax rate will depend on various factors  such as changes in our valuation allowance  pending or future tax law changes including rate changes and the tax benefit from research and development credits  potential limitations on the use of federal and state net operating losses  and state taxes
