for these periods  the activities of the aviation transportation services segment has been presented as discontinued operations 
general demand for our services 
we receive our revenues from customers in the energy industry 
demand for our services is principally impacted by conditions affecting geophysical companies engaged in the acquisition of d seismic data and oil and gas companies operating primarily in the shallow waters of the gulf of mexico 
the level of activity for our services is primarily influenced by the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies 

table of contents 
index to financial statements a number of factors affect the decision of oil and gas companies to pursue the acquisition of seismic data and the exploration for oil and gas  including i prevailing and expected oil and gas demand and prices  ii the cost of exploring for  producing and developing oil and gas reserves  iii the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  iv the availability and cost of permits and consents from landowners to conduct seismic activity  v local and international political and economic conditions  vi governmental regulations  and vii the availability and cost of capital 
the ability to finance the acquisition of seismic data in the absence of oil and gas companies interest in obtaining the information is also a factor  as some geophysical companies will acquire seismic data on a speculative basis 
seasonality and weather risks 
our operations are subject to seasonal variations in weather conditions and daylight hours as our activities take place outdoors 
on average  fewer hours are worked per day and fewer holes are generally drilled or surveyed per day in winter months than in summer months due to an increase in rainy  foggy  and cold conditions and a decrease in daylight hours

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we extend credit to customers and other parties in the normal course of business 
we regularly review outstanding receivables  and provide for estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established reserves  we make judgments regarding the parties ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful account may be required 
due to the nature of our industry  we may periodically have concentration of credit risks 
as a result  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be significant 
inventory we have made significant investments in inventory to service our equipment 
on a routine basis  we use judgments in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or market 
technological innovations  market activity levels and the physical condition of products primarily influence our estimates 
changes in these or other factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for differences between the book basis and tax basis of our net assets 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider current tax regulations  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
we have established reserves to reduce our net deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value 
if tax regulations change  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
in making this determination  we have considered future income in assessing the ultimate recoverability of the recognized net deferred tax asset 
we record liabilities for environmental obligations when remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates are based on currently enacted laws and regulations 
as more information becomes available or environmental laws and regulations change  such liabilities may be required to be adjusted 
additionally  in connection with acquisitions  we obtain indemnifications from the seller related to environmental matters 
if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their obligations  adjustments of recorded amounts may be required 
we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations 
we retain a portion of losses that occur through the use of deductibles and  to a limited extent  self funded insurance programs 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through insurance reserves 
as claims develop and additional information becomes available  adjustments to loss reserves may be required

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates  primarily in the united states 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt
