management defines risk as the potential deviation from planned operating results that may have a negative impact on investor enterprise value in the short or long term 
the deviation can arise from inadequate or ineffective internal processes or systems  external events or company personnel 
the key driver in managing strategic and operating risks in order to maximize enterprise value is consistent execution of the long range plan initiatives  which are described below 
during the turnaround period  the company s enterprise value increased significantly and its portfolio of risks was managed effectively 
managing strategic and operating risks provides both opportunities to capitalize on positive events and mitigate negative circumstances 
strategies of the long range plan to transition the company from a turnaround to a position of leadership within the retail industry  and realize the company s vision of becoming the preferred choice for the american moderate shopper  the company is focused on four key strategies making an emotional connection with the customer  making jcpenney an easy and exciting place to shop  making jcpenney a great place to work and making jcpenney a leader in performance and execution 
the first strategy making an emotional connection with the customer involves offering styles that inspire and reflect the lifestyles of the company s target customer  building jcpenney private brands to develop customer loyalty  providing quality merchandise at smart prices and developing powerful marketing that attracts new and existing customers to visit jcpenney on a regular basis

the company has implemented contingency plans that include the identification of alternate sources for product and the uninterrupted access to product 
cost reductions will allow the company to invest in higher quality merchandise  which will increase the value proposition to the company s target customer 
the company could also be impacted by logistical or other issues faced by suppliers or have an interruption in one of the company s store distribution centers 
however  the company has a diversified supplier base  both domestic and foreign  and is not dependent to any significant degree on any single supplier 
additionally  the company has business continuity plans in place for all merchandise distribution centers that would provide rerouting of merchandise allocations to have uninterrupted flow of merchandise to both stores and direct to customers 
the second strategy making jcpenney an easy and exciting place to shop relates to the company s initiatives to interact with customers in a pleasant and efficient manner  communicate clearly  and add interest  newness and excitement to the shopping experience 
the company describes its target customer as having too little time  too little money  and two little kids

also  as part of the new pos system  beginning in  customers will be asked to rate their overall shopping experience with jcpenney at the point of sale 
benchmarking provides an opportunity to learn from best practices both outside and inside the company  and thereby enhance the company s ability to achieve its customer centered strategies to make an emotional connection with the jcpenney customer and make jcpenney an easy and exciting place to shop  with the ultimate goal of obtaining a higher market share within the retail sector 
the third strategy making jcpenney a great place to work recognizes the importance of attracting  developing and retaining the best people in retail  and creating and sustaining a customer focused culture 
building on the company s founding values  the current initiatives to make jcpenney a great place to work are embodied in principles that management has labeled winning together principles

management believes that being part of a winning team is something that all associates can be proud of and should contribute to the company s ability  over time  to accomplish its strategy of making jcpenney a great place to work 
the fourth strategy making jcpenney a leader in performance and execution focuses on earnings per share growth through maintaining consistent  competitive sales growth  increasing the productivity of assets  including inventory and selling space  optimizing operating speed and cycle time  improving gross margin  and leveraging the expense structure leading to top quartile performance in the retail industry 
the company s performance in represented significant strides in its progress toward industry leadership  and was the result of continued improvement in operating results and the completion of capital structure repositioning programs

these new systems have allowed the company to improve the planning of merchandise assortments  allocate inventory and stock stores  better track sales trends enabling prompt replenishment and make more timely pricing decisions 
key to meeting the company s long term customer and financial goals is continued realization of the benefits from centralized buying and allocation 
the effectiveness of these processes and systems is an important component of the company s ability to have the right inventory at the right place  time and price 
another key company initiative is reducing private brand cycle time the time it takes from concept until the merchandise hits the selling floor 
with the company s most recent private brand launch  ana  management was able to substantially reduce the cycle time 
as discussed under the first strategy above  the company s substantial sourcing abilities should enable the company to continue to reduce the product lead times and offer customers more relevant and timely merchandise

critical accounting policies the application of accounting policies necessarily involves judgment and  in certain instances  the use of estimates and assumptions 
different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
management believes that the accounting policies used to develop estimates that are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the company s reported results relate to inventory valuation under the retail method of accounting  valuation of long lived assets  estimation of reserves and valuation allowances  specifically related to closed stores  insurance  income taxes  litigation and environmental contingencies  and pension accounting 
although the company also has other policies considered key accounting policies  such as revenue recognition  these policies do not require management to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
the company s management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board and its independent auditors 
the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosures relating to these policies in this management s discussion and analysis 
for a complete list of the company s significant accounting policies  see note  which begins on page f inventory valuation under the retail method inventories are valued primarily at the lower of cost using the last in  first out or lifo method or market  determined by the retail method for department stores and store distribution centers  and standard cost  representing average vendor cost  for direct and regional warehouses 
under the retail method  inventory is segregated into groupings of merchandise having similar characteristics and is stated at its current retail selling value 
inventory retail values are converted to a cost basis by applying 
table of contents 
index to financial statements specific average cost factors to each grouping of merchandise 
cost factors represent the average cost to retail ratio for each merchandise group based on the beginning of period inventory plus the current period s purchase activity  as calculated on a monthly basis  for each store location 
accordingly  a significant assumption under retail method accounting is that the inventory in each group of merchandise is similar in terms of its cost to retail relationship and has similar gross margin and turnover rates 
management monitors the content of merchandise in these groupings to ensure distortions that would have a material effect on inventory valuation do not occur 
the retail method inherently requires management judgment and certain estimates that may significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as gross margin 
among others  two of the most significant estimates are permanent reductions to retail prices markdowns used to clear unproductive or slow moving inventory and inventory shortages shrinkage 
permanent markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded at the point of decision  when the utility of inventory has diminished  versus the point of sale 
factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and style trends 
the corresponding reduction to gross margin is also recorded in the period the decision is made 
shrinkage is estimated as a percentage of sales for the period from the last inventory date to the end of the fiscal year 
physical inventories are taken at least annually for all department stores  store distribution centers  warehouses and direct fulfillment centers on a staggered basis throughout the year  and inventory records are adjusted accordingly 
the shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory  in combination with current events and historical experience  is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual rate for the next inventory cycle 
to estimate the effects of inflation deflation on ending inventory  an internal index measuring price changes from the beginning to the end of the year is calculated using merchandise cost data at the item level 
valuation of long lived assets management evaluates recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  for example  when a store s performance falls below minimum company standards 
in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  management reviews the performance of individual stores 
underperforming stores are selected for further evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying amounts 
if the evaluation  done on an undiscounted cash flow basis  indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset 
management estimates fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that is considered to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
additional factors are taken into consideration  such as local market conditions  operating environment  mall performance and other trends 
impairment losses totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively  were recorded for underperforming department stores and underutilized direct and other facilities 
if different assumptions were made or different market conditions were present  any estimated potential impairment amounts could vary from recorded amounts 

table of contents 
index to financial statements reserves and valuation allowances based on an overall analysis of store performance and expected trends  management periodically evaluates the need to close underperforming stores 
reserves are established at the point of closure for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations pvol  net of estimated sublease income  and at the point of decision for severance and other exit costs  as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
see further discussion in note on page f two key assumptions in calculating the reserve include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements and estimation of other related exit costs 
if different assumptions were used regarding the timing and potential termination costs  the resulting reserves could vary from recorded amounts 
reserves are reviewed periodically and adjusted  when necessary 
the company records a provision for workers compensation and general liability risk based on historical experience  current claims data and independent actuarial best estimates  including incurred but not reported claims 
the company targets this provision above the midpoint of the actuarial range  and total estimated claim liability amounts are discounted using a risk free rate 
income taxes are estimated for each jurisdiction in which the company operates 
this involves assessing the current tax exposure together with temporary differences  which result from differing treatment of items for tax and book purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for based on these assessments 
deferred tax assets are evaluated for recoverability based on estimated future taxable income 
to the extent that recovery is deemed unlikely  a valuation allowance is recorded 
during  management determined that the company will more likely than not generate sufficient income over the next several years to utilize state tax net operating losses for which a valuation allowance had been recorded 
this valuation allowance was appropriately reversed 
tax reserves are provided for when the company considers that it is probable that taxes will be due 
such reserves are evaluated and adjusted as appropriate  while taking into account the progress of audits of various taxing jurisdictions 
management does not expect the outcome of tax audits to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
many years of data have been incorporated into the determination of tax reserves  and the company s estimates have historically been reasonable 
the company is involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters 
reserves have been established based on management s best estimates of the company s potential liability in these matters 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel 
management does not believe that these proceedings and inquiries  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow 
see further discussion in note reserves for potential environmental liabilities related to facilities  most of which the company no longer operates  are adjusted based on the company s experience  as well as consultation with independent engineering firms and in house legal counsel  as appropriate 
management continues to believe established reserves are adequate to cover estimated potential liabilities 
pension pension accounting jcp sponsors a non contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan the primary pension plan  supplemental retirement plans for certain management associates and other postretirement benefit 
table of contents 
index to financial statements plans 
refer to note for further discussion of these plans 
major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 
assumptions are determined based on company information and market indicators and are evaluated at each annual measurement date october 
a change in any of these assumptions could have a significant effect on the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs 
these assumptions require significant judgment  and the calculation of pension costs is relatively complex 
the company utilizes third parties  including actuarial and investment advisory firms  to help evaluate the appropriateness of the expected rate of return  the discount rate and other pension plan assumptions annually 
the following discussion relates to the primary pension plan only  since it represents the majority of the company s recorded pension expense and related asset liability amounts in its consolidated financial statements 
demographic assumptions for purposes of estimating demographic mortality in the measurement of the company s pension obligation  as of october   the company began using the retirement plans table of combined healthy lives  projected to  using scale aa to forecast mortality improvements five years into the future to previously  the company had utilized the group annuity mortality table  which it continues to use for calculating funding requirements based on internal revenue service regulations 
this change did not have a material impact on the projected benefit obligation 
market related value of plan assets in accounting for pension costs  the company uses fair value  which is the market value of plan assets as of the annual measurement date  to calculate the expected return on assets and gain loss amortization components of net periodic pension expense 
return on plan assets to develop its expected return on plan assets  the company considers its long term asset allocation policy  historical returns on plan assets and overall capital market returns  taking into account current and expected market conditions 
the company s primary pension plan is well diversified with an asset allocation policy that provides for a targeted  and mix of equities us  us and private  fixed income investment grade and high yield and real estate private and public  respectively 
this allocation provides the pension plan with the appropriate balance of investment return and volatility risk  given the funded nature of the plan  its present and future liability characteristics and its long term investment horizon 
see note for a further discussion of the asset allocation strategy for plan assets 
since the inception of the company s primary pension plan in through the october  measurement date  the average annual return has been 
after three years of decline in the fair value of pension assets during the bear market  pension assets experienced significant increases due to three years of annual gains in global equity markets in  and the one year return on plan assets was through october   following one year returns on plan assets through october  and october  of and  respectively 
because the fair value of plan assets is measured as of a point in time  the change in fair value between measurement dates affects the subsequent year s net pension expense 
the increase in fair value in and positively impacted net pension expense in and and reversed the trend of net pension expense increases from to net periodic pension expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
since inception  the company s primary pension plan has incurred cumulative pre tax expense of approximately million

see discussion of the impact on earnings below 
discount rate the company lowered the discount rate used to measure the pension obligation from to in  from to in and from to in  based on the yield to maturity of a representative portfolio of aa rated corporate bonds as of the october measurement dates in  and  with average cash flow durations similar to the pension liability 
this methodology is consistent with guidance in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  to use the rate currently available on high quality bonds and the subsequent guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission that high quality bonds should be those with at least aa rating by a recognized rating agency 
impact on earnings and sensitivity as a result of strong asset performance in and  the company incurred a significant decrease in and net pension costs  which incrementally improved eps by approximately and  respectively  compared to a reduction in eps of in while the positive return on plan assets is expected to lower the expense  this is somewhat offset by a lower discount rate in each of the last three years and that the company did not make a voluntary pension contribution to its primary pension plan in due to the plan s well funded position and internal revenue service rules limiting tax deductible contributions 
the sensitivity of the pension expense to a plus or minus one half of one percent of expected return on assets is a decrease or increase in expense of approximately per share 
the sensitivity of the pension expense to a plus or minus one half of one percent of the discount rate is a decrease or increase in expense of approximately per share 
pension funding funding policy the company s funding policy is to maintain a well funded pension plan throughout all business and economic cycles 
maintaining a well funded plan over time provides additional financial flexibility to the company  including lower pension expense and reduced cash contributions  especially in the event of a decline in the capital markets 
in addition  a well funded plan assures associates of the plan s and the company s financial ability to continue to provide competitive retirement benefits  while at the same time being cost effective 
the company targets to maintain a funded ratio in the range of to  which is the plan s assets as a percent of the actuarial funding liability under the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
funding history since the plan s inception  the company has contributed billion  or approximately billion on an after tax basis  to its primary pension plan 
over this timeframe  actual investment return on plan assets has generated a significant portion of the billion in pension plan total value  defined as billion in cumulative benefit payments to retired associates plus billion in plan assets at the measurement date in in effect  the company s cumulative after tax cash contributions over this timeframe represent approximately of the plan s total value ie  billion as a percent of billion 
the remainder of the plan s total value has been generated by the actual investment returns since inception 
the company targets to maintain its portion of the primary pension plan s total value to a level of or less  primarily through its funding policy and asset mix strategy 
targeting the

the company made cash contributions to its primary pension plan annually during the period in order to provide an asset base to support the accelerating liability growth in the early years of the plan 
over the period  the company made cash contributions to the plan in seven years  and no contributions in the other years due to maintaining a well funded plan and the actual investment return on plan assets 
funded status the company s primary pension plan remains in a well funded position 
although no additional funding was required under erisa  the company made discretionary contributions of million  or million after tax  to its primary pension plan in october of  and the company did not make a discretionary contribution to the pension plan in due to the plan s well funded position and internal revenue service rules limiting tax deductible contributions 
at october   plan assets of billion were approximately of the billion erisa funding liability 
at october  and  the funded ratios were and  respectively 
the increase in the funded ratio resulted primarily from the improvements in the global equity markets 
expected contributions contributions subsequent to for the pension plan are dependent on asset returns and future discount rates and legislative changes 
the company does not anticipate mandatory funding requirements in under erisa 
it plans to make a discretionary contribution  however  if market conditions  the funded position of the pension plan  and any legislative developments allow such a contribution to be tax deductible

for grants subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model developed by outside consultants who worked with the company in the implementation of sfas no 
r 
the company believes that the binomial lattice model is a more accurate model for valuing employee stock options since it better reflects the impact of stock price changes on option exercise behavior 
the expected volatility used in the binomial lattice model is based on an analysis of historical prices of jcpenney s stock and open market exchanged options  and was developed in consultation with an outside valuation specialist and the company s financial advisors 
the expected volatility reflects the volatility implied from a price quoted for a hypothetical call option with a duration consistent with the expected life of the options and the volatility implied by the trading of options to purchase the company s stock on open market exchanges 
as a result of the company s recently completed turnaround that began in and the disposition of the eckerd drugstore operations  a significant portion of historical volatility is not considered to be a good indicator of future volatility 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model  and represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding 
this model incorporates an early exercise assumption in the event of a significant increase in stock price 
the risk free rate is based on zero coupon us treasury yields in effect at the date of grant with the same period as the expected option life 
the dividend yield is assumed to increase ratably to the company s expected dividend yield level based on targeted payout ratios over the expected life of the options 
the company has not adjusted prior year financial statements under the optional modified retrospective method of application  but has disclosed the pro forma impact of expensing stock options on and in note stock awards the company s stock based compensation plan also provides for grants of restricted and non restricted stock awards shares and units to associates and non employee members of the board
