item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  please read business risk factors included elsewhere in this report and cautionary statement about forward looking statements below 
executive overview general overview of our business revenues 
our operations consist of the collection  transfer  processing and disposal of non hazardous construction and demolition debris and industrial and municipal solid waste 
our revenues are generated primarily from our collection operations to residential  commercial and roll off customers and landfill disposal services 
roll off service is the hauling and disposal of large waste containers typically between and cubic yards that are loaded onto and off of the collection vehicle 
the following table reflects our total revenue by source for the previous three years dollars in thousands collection residential commercial roll off other total collection disposal less intercompany disposal  net transfer and other less intercompany transfer and other  net total revenue financial objectives the following financial objectives were established in march revenue in excess of million a increase over reported revenues  adjusted ebitda  which is a non gaap financial measure  in excess of million a increase over  run rate revenue from operations acquired in to be approximately million  net income to be in the range of to per share  depending on the timing of acquisitions and the form of any capital and related charges that we might obtain to fund acquisitions  and year end run rates of revenue and adjusted ebitda  to be more than two times similar measures for the year ended december  which were representative of our run rates at the time of our initial public offering 

table of contents business performance during  our revenues were million  which represents a increase over adjusted ebitda for the year was million  an increase of over run rate revenue from acquired businesses during was million 
in addition to the million generated from newly acquired businesses  revenue from existing operations grew by approximately million or as a result of price and volume increases over certain locations implemented price increases throughout and therefore the effect is expected to carryover into net income per share was 
this shortfall was largely the result of higher than anticipated borrowing costs under our credit facilities 
underlying libor interest rates rose from to and our average borrowing costs increased from to 
had interest rates remained at the levels in effect at the beginning of  earnings per share would have been 
in order to better manage changes in interest rates  in november  we entered into a swap arrangement with our primary lender as intermediary to exchange million of our floating rate debt for fixed rate debt 
the underlying base rate is now plus the applicable margin which was at december  our net income also included a charge of million net of tax provision or per share on million fully diluted shares for the write off of deferred financing costs and debt discount due to the restructuring of our credit facility 
excluding the effects of the interest rate increase and the write off of deferred financing costs and debt discount  our earnings per share would have been 
our run rate revenue at december  was million or times of our run rate revenue of million 
our run rate ebitda at december  was million or times of our run rate ebitda of million 
we have been able to maintain our operating margins throughout the period of growth 
our adjusted operating profit margins were in  in and were in we believe our operating margins are among the highest in the industry 
our operating margins are high in part because of the proportionally high number of landfills we have and the amount of waste we internalize into those landfills 
we internalized approximately of the waste we collected in both and financial objectives our expectations  not including the impact of acquisitions  are as follows revenue in excess of million a increase over reported revenues  operating income in excess of million a increase over  and ebitda in excess of million a increase over 
please note that these financial objectives are all forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  please read business risk factors and cautionary statement about forward looking statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition  as we have previously reported  we intend to review price increase opportunities to recover cost increases and improve operating margins 
as we have in the past  we also will look for opportunities to improve operating margins by reducing operating costs 
those opportunities may involve a variety of initiatives  including improvements to systems and programs and evaluation of location specific operating results 
as we discuss in liquidity and capital resources cash flows below  we expect capital expenditures related to our existing operations for to be approximately of our revenue  which would include expenditures for vehicles  heavy equipment  containers  landfill cell development  and certain systems and program improvements 
non gaap measures 
our management evaluates our performance based on non gaap measures  of which the primary performance measure is ebitda 
ebitda consists of earnings net income before interest expense including the write off of deferred financing costs and debt discount  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization 
we also compute ebitda before the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle and before 
table of contents considering the effect of discontinued operations as the effect of these items is not relevant to our ongoing operations 
we also use these same measures when evaluating potential acquisition candidates 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it is widely used by investors in our industry to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense  depreciation and amortization  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets  financing methods  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  it helps investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation and amortization of our assets from our operating results  and it helps investors identify items that are within operational control 
depreciation charges  while a component of operating income  are fixed at the time of the asset purchase in accordance with the depreciable lives of the related asset and as such are not a directly controllable period operating charge 
our management uses ebitda as a measure of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure and asset base from our operating results  as one method we use to estimate a purchase price often expressed as a multiple of ebitda for solid waste companies we intend to acquire 
the appropriate ebitda multiple will vary from acquisition to acquisition depending on factors such as the size of the operation  the type of operation  the strategic location of the operation in its market as well as other considerations  in presentations to our board of directors to enable them to have the same consistent measurement basis of operating performance used by management  as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations  in evaluations of field operations since it represents operational performance and takes into account financial measures within the control of the field operating units  as a component of incentive cash bonuses paid to our executive officers and other employees  to assess compliance with financial ratios and covenants included in our credit facility  and in communications with investors  lenders  and others  concerning our financial performance 
the following presents a reconciliation of the total ebitda to net income loss in thousands total ebitda depreciation and amortization interest expense  net write off of deferred financing costs and debt discount an additional interest charge income tax benefit expense income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
table of contents loss from discontinued operations  net of tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income loss in considering ebitda results  our management also takes various adjustments especially for non operational expenses into account in evaluating performance in order to provide it with what it believes to be a better view of ongoing operational performance 
thus  for example  in our evaluations we exclude the stock based compensation charge of million million net of tax benefit incurred during as these are non cash charges related to our former parent company s outstanding stock option plan 
we do not exclude stock based compensation expense related to our restricted share plan as it is a recurring expense 
we make similar adjustments in evaluating acquisition candidates for non recurring items 
the following presents a reconciliation of ebitda to adjusted ebitda in thousands total ebitda  per above stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda our ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as we define them  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies and are not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for operating income  net income or loss  cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities  or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 
other considerations 
costs of services include  but are not limited to  labor  fuel and other vehicle operating expenses  equipment maintenance  disposal fees paid to third party disposal facilities  insurance premiums and claims expense  third party transportation expense and state waste taxes 
the frequency and amount of claims or incidents could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and or year to year  resulting in increased volatility of our costs of services 
general and administrative expenses include the salaries and benefits of our corporate management  certain centralized reporting  information technology and cash management costs and other overhead costs associated with our corporate office 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method and amortization of landfill costs and asset retirement costs based on the consumption of airspace 
we capitalize third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions  such as legal  engineering  and accounting expenses  and certain direct expenditures such as travel costs 
we expense indirect acquisition costs  such as salaries  commissions and other corporate services  as we incur them 
we routinely evaluate all capitalized costs  and expense those related to projects that we believe are not likely to succeed 
as of december   we had million of capitalized costs relating to pending acquisitions 
the integration expenses associated with our acquisitions include expenses related to i incorporating new truck fleets into our preventative maintenance program  ii the testing of new employees to comply with department of transportation regulations  iii implementing our safety program  iv re routing trucks and equipment  and v conversion of customers to our billing system 
in the short term  as expected  the cost of acquiring and integrating companies will continue to put pressure on operating results 
while some synergies from tuck in acquisitions can take as long as twelve months to be realized  we have integrated all of our completed acquisitions to date into our existing operations 

table of contents goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired entities 
in allocating the purchase price of an acquired company among its assets  we first assign value to the tangible assets  followed by intangible assets such as covenants not to compete and any remaining amounts are then allocated to goodwill 
acquisition strategy overview as we discussed in business our acquisition growth strategy our acquisition strategy will target operations that will benefit from our core operating strategy of maximizing the internalization of waste 
in markets where we already own a landfill  we intend to focus on expanding our presence by tuck in acquisitions 
tuck in acquisitions will allow growth in revenue and increase market share and enable integration and consolidation of duplicative facilities and functions to maximize cost efficiencies and economies of scale 
we will typically seek to enter a new market by acquiring a permitted landfill operation in that market 
upon acquiring a landfill in a new market  we then expand our operations to collection services by acquiring collection operations in the new market and internalizing the waste into our landfill 
we intend to pursue our acquisition strategy primarily with cash  including borrowings under our combined credit facility entered 
we may also issue shares of common stock in connection with acquisitions 
since completing our initial public offering in june through the year ended december   we have completed acquisitions 
the purchase price for these acquisitions consisted of million of cash  million of convertible debt  million of assumed debt net of million of debt discount  million of assumed deferred tax liabilities and  shares of our common stock 
we completed acquisitions during the year ended december  total consideration for these acquisitions was approximately million  including million in cash  million in convertible debt  million in debt assumed  net of discount  million in deferred tax liabilities assumed and million in common stock 
contemporaneously with one acquisition  certain individuals affiliated with the seller purchased million in convertible debt

table of contents on february   we acquired transit waste llc from waste corporation of america llc  which was previously part of our corporate group and with which we still maintain certain other relationships 
this transaction included the acquisition of one msw landfill and a collection operation 
the landfill is located in durango  colorado and the collection company is located in bloomfield  new mexico 
this acquisition allows us to expand our operations into the colorado and new mexico markets 
together with the acquisition of transit waste  we have made acquisitions totaling million in estimated annual run rate revenue since completing our initial public offering in june  and own and or operate landfills  collection operations and transfer stations mrfs 
for a description of our accounting for acquisitions and acquisition related expenses  please read notes and to the financial statements 
after an acquisition is completed we incur integration expenses related to i incorporating new truck fleets into our preventative maintenance program  ii the testing of new employees to comply with department of transportation regulations  iii implementing our safety program  iv re routing trucks and equipment  and v conversion of customers to our billing system 
we generally expect that the costs of acquiring and integrating an acquired business will be incurred primarily during the first months after acquisition 
synergies from tuck in acquisitions can also take as long as months to be realized 
results of operations the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statement of operations in thousands and as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and years ended december  revenue cost of services depreciation and amortization general and administrative stock based compensation charge operating income loss interest expense  net write off of deferred financing costs and debt discount other income  net income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle loss from discontinued operations  net of tax gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  increased by  to million from million for the year ended december  acquisitions contributed million of the increase while internal volume growth contributed million  operational price increases contributed million  and pricing from fuel surcharges achieved the remaining increases 
cost of services 
total cost of services for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  acquisitions and integration costs accounted for a majority of the increased cost of services 
while cost of services increased in total  they have decreased to of revenue from last year 
this decrease can be attributed to decreases in insurance costs associated with improved claim history 
further reductions in operating costs as a percentage of revenue were achieved related to certain licenses and fees  landfill site expenses and field administrative costs which are 
table of contents semi fixed and do not increase proportional with revenue 
these improvements were partially offset by fuel costs that increased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  these increases can be attributed to acquisitions and increased amortization corresponding with increased landfill volumes 
general and administrative 
total general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to increased administrative costs associated with being a public company  including legal  accounting  compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  printing  travel  insurance and other costs  including costs associated with our ongoing acquisition program 
stock based compensation charge 
we recognized a compensation charge of million during the year ended december  prior to our internal reorganization  our former parent  waste corporation of america  had options and warrants outstanding 
as part of the internal reorganization  we assumed the obligation to issue shares upon the exercise of such options and warrants 
subsequently  we extinguished approximately of such outstanding stock options and warrants by issuing  shares after giving effect to a merger and reverse stock split prior to our initial public offering in june of our common stock 
this restructuring led to the million compensation charge prior to our initial public offering that occurred in june based on the estimated fair value of the stock issued in cancellation of the options and warrants 
the stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  relates to earned compensation from restricted stock grants under the amended and restated wca waste corporation incentive plan 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  interest expense increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase relates to the higher average interest rate  the higher average debt balance outstanding as a result of additional borrowings under our credit facilities as well as seller notes issued and debt assumed in connection with acquisitions 
our average borrowing costs went from at the end of to at the end of write off of deferred financing costs and debt discount 
the million write off of deferred financing costs and debt discount incurred during is associated with the restructuring of our credit facility in april as well as the repayment of the environmental facilities revenue bonds in june the million write off of deferred financing costs for is associated with the amendment of our credit facility in december income tax provision benefit 
income tax provision benefit in the year ended december  as a percentage of pre tax income loss was as compared to for the year ended december  the rate in the prior year reflects the lower tax benefit applied to the million stock based compensation charge  as well as the impact of non deductible expenses reducing our net loss for tax purposes 
net income loss 
we had net income of million for the year ended december  as compared to net loss of million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily caused by the million non cash compensation charge in  net of a million tax benefit 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  increased by to million from million for the year ended december  acquisitions completed in the third and fourth quarters of contributed million of the increase while volume increases resulted in an increase of million  and price increases contributed million 
non acquisition related volume increases were a 
table of contents result of the opening of two transfer stations in as well as other internal growth 
revenue segmentation before elimination of intercompany revenue for the year ended december  was collection operations  disposal  transfer and recycling 
cost of services 
total cost of services for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  operating cost increases reflect a variety of factors 
thus  our costs reflect  in part  the impact of recent acquisitions and other volume related growth 
as previously discussed  we expect to incur higher costs while we acquire and integrate new operations 
increases in fuel costs contributed to the cost increases as well 
diesel fuel costs as a percentage of revenue increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  a sampling of our markets indicates that our average fuel cost per gallon increased approximately from january to december the increase in costs could not be fully covered by fuel surcharges as evidenced by the fact that fourth quarter fuel surcharges covered approximately of increased costs 
through a combination of price increases and fuel surcharges  we expect to begin to recover an additional portion of fuel cost increases by july additionally  we spent approximately million to redirect waste from our central missouri landfill through one of our transfer stations to our black oak landfill 
this waste was redirected temporarily while the expanded area of the central missouri landfill was being constructed 
the construction of this expansion was completed in january depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  depreciation as a percentage of revenue remained stable at approximately 
the increase was primarily associated with acquisitions during as well as the commencement of two new transfer station operations during the first quarter of general and administrative 
total general and administrative expense for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to increased costs including the incremental overhead required to comply with public company reporting responsibilities as well as additional overhead incurred in support of our acquisition program 
stock based compensation charge 
we recognized a compensation charge of million for the year ended december  prior to our internal reorganization  our former parent  waste corporation of america  had options and warrants outstanding 
as part of the internal reorganization  we assumed the obligation to issue shares upon the exercise of such options and warrants 
subsequently  we extinguished approximately of such outstanding stock options and warrants by issuing  shares after giving effect to a merger and reverse stock split prior to our initial public offering in june of our common stock 
this restructuring led to the million compensation charge prior to our initial public offering that occurred in june based on the estimated fair value of the stock issued in cancellation of the options and warrants 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net decreased by million in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the reduction relates to the lower average debt balance resulting from the repayment of a portion of our outstanding debt with the proceeds of the initial public offering 
write off of deferred financing costs 
the million write off of deferred financing costs is associated with the amendment of our credit facility in december other income  net 
other income  net for the year ended december  reflects primarily the gains on the disposition of fixed assets and the gain associated with the sale of certain rural routes in missouri 

table of contents income tax provision benefit 
income tax provision benefit in the year ended december  as a percentage of pre tax income loss was as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the current year rate relates to the lower tax benefit applied to the stock based compensation charge in the second quarter of  as well as the impact of non deductible expenses reducing our net loss for tax purposes and the recognition of certain state tax benefits on current year losses as we project future taxable income in these states due to the completion of acquisitions 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax for the period ended december  is due to the adoption of sfas no 
 effective january   which resulted in a million benefit  net of a million tax expense 
net income loss 
we had net loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily a result of the million non cash compensation charge discussed above  net of a million tax benefit and the million benefit in from the adoption of sfas no 
liquidity and capital resources our business and industry is capital intensive  requiring capital for equipment purchases  landfill construction and development  and landfill closure activities in the future 
our planned acquisition strategy also requires significant capital 
we plan to meet our future capital needs primarily through cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
we plan to meet the capital requirements of our acquisition strategy from a variety of sources including cash on hand  borrowing capacity under our credit facilities  seller notes  equity issuances and debt financings 
we expect these sources will be adequate to fund our future capital needs and acquisition strategy for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had total outstanding long term debt of approximately million  consisting primarily of approximately million outstanding under our credit facilities  and approximately million of various seller notes and million of assumed debt associated with acquisitions 
this represented an increase of million over our total debt outstanding as of december  the increase in outstanding debt since december  was due primarily to amounts paid in connection with acquisitions 
additionally  subsequent to december   in connection with the completion of our transit waste acquisition  we assumed million of debt  million of which was repaid on february  effective november   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement whereby we exchanged million of our floating rate debt for five year fixed rate debt 
as a result of this agreement  the libor component of our interest rate will be on the first million of our borrowings for the remainder of the term of the swap agreement 
as of december   we had a working capital surplus of million that improved million from a working capital deficit of million as of december  the improvement can be attributed to the restructuring and funding of the credit facilities in april as well as timing differences in collection of receivables and payments of current liabilities 
our first lien credit agreement as described below includes a swing line feature  which monitors cash requirements or excesses on a daily basis 
after meeting current working capital and capital expenditure requirements  our cash strategy is to use the available swing line feature of our first lien credit agreement to maintain a minimum cash and cash equivalents balance and use excess cash to reduce our indebtedness under the first lien credit agreement 
in december we exercised the accordion option on our credit facility and increased the capacity of our revolving line of credit by million 
as of december   we had million in available capacity under the revolving portion of the first lien credit agreement 
tax exempt bonds on june   we fully repaid the million of outstanding environmental facilities revenue bonds with the proceeds from the credit agreements 
in connection with the acquisition of ft 
meade landfill in october 
table of contents  we assumed million in tax exempt environmental facilities revenue bonds 
the bonds bear interest at to with annual installments through september the weighted average rate as of december  was 
subsequent to december   we assumed an additional million of tax exempt environmental facilities revenue bonds as part of the debt assumed in the transit waste acquisition 
credit facility on april  the closing date  wca waste systems  inc wsi  our primary operating subsidiary  replaced its fourth amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of december  the fourth restated credit agreement  by entering into a first lien credit agreement the first lien credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo  as administrative agent  comerica bank  as syndication agent  and the lenders party thereto 
on the closing date  wsi also entered into a second lien credit agreement the second lien credit agreement and together with the first lien credit agreement  the credit agreements with wells fargo  as administrative agent  and ares capital corporation  as the lender 
in connection with the closing of the credit agreements and the subsequent repayment of our environmental facilities revenue bonds  we incurred a charge to earnings of million  net of tax  related to the write off of a portion of our deferred financing costs and debt discount during the second quarter of the following is a summary description of the material terms of the credit agreements and  as such  is not complete 
the aggregate credit commitments available under the credit agreements total million and include a million revolving credit facility under the first lien credit agreement  including subfacilities for o standby letters of credit in the aggregate principal amount of up to million  and o a swing line feature for up to million for same day advances  a million term b loan under the first lien credit agreement the term b loan  reducing by  per quarter beginning june   and a million second lien term loan under the second lien credit agreement the second lien term loan 
wsi must make mandatory prepayments of outstanding indebtedness under the first lien credit agreement in the amount of i of the net cash proceeds received from the sale of certain assets that are not replaced  ii of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of any subordinated debt to the extent that such proceeds exceed million the terms of which must be satisfactory to wells fargo and a majority of the lenders  iii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of any common stock of wca waste to the extent that such proceeds exceed million  and iv of the net cash proceeds from the sale of any preferred stock or other non common stock equity offering of wca waste 
these payments are applied  first  to amounts owing on the term b loan in the inverse order of maturity 
wsi must make comparable paydowns on the second lien credit agreement after payment in full of the first lien credit agreement 

table of contents the revolving credit loan under the first lien credit agreement will mature on april  and the term b loan will mature on april  unless the commitments thereunder are terminated or prepaid in full at an earlier date 
the second lien credit agreement will mature on october  wsi s obligations under the credit agreements are secured by the capital stock of our subsidiaries and all tangible including real estate and intangible assets belonging to us and our subsidiaries 
the obligations are also guaranteed by certain material subsidiaries of wca waste 
obligations under the credit agreements are recourse obligations and are subject to cancellation and or acceleration upon the occurrence of certain events  including  among other things  a change of control as defined in the credit agreements  nonpayment  breaches of representations  warranties and covenants subject to cure periods in certain instances  bankruptcy or insolvency  defaults under other debt arrangements  failure to pay certain judgments and the occurrence of events creating material adverse effects 
indebtedness under any base rate loans as defined in the first lien credit agreement carries interest at the higher of i the effective federal funds rate as defined in the first lien credit agreement plus of or ii the rate of interest from time to time announced publicly by wells fargo  in san francisco  california as its prime rate  plus the applicable margin for base rate loans ranging from to depending on the leverage ratio 
indebtedness under any libor loans as defined in the first lien credit agreement carries interest at a rate per year rounded upwards  if necessary  to the nearest of determined by the administrative agent to be equal to the quotient of a libor as defined in the first lien credit agreement divided by b one minus the reserve requirement as defined in the first lien credit agreement  plus the applicable margin for libor loans ranging from to depending on the leverage ratio 
the commitment fee payable by wsi to the administrative agent for the benefit of the lenders on the daily average unused amount of the aggregate revolving credit commitment under the first lien credit agreement ranges from to depending on wsi s leverage ratio 
the first lien credit agreement contains numerous covenants with which wsi and the subsidiaries consolidated must comply  including several financial covenants and ratios 
these include a leverage test  a senior leverage test  a net worth requirement and an adjusted ebit test 
the maximum leverage ratio the ratio of funded debt to pro forma adjusted ebitda under the first lien credit agreement must be not more than to until march   and to or less thereafter 
the maximum senior funded debt leverage ratio under the first lien credit agreement the ratio of funded senior debt all funded debt other than subordinated debt to pro forma adjusted ebitda must be to or less from the closing date through the quarter ending march   decreasing in stages to a maximum of to or less for the quarter ending september  and for all quarters thereafter 
the minimum net worth as defined in the first lien credit agreement under the first lien credit agreement is of net worth on june   plus of positive net income  plus of the increase to net worth from the net cash proceeds from equity offerings  in each case  since june  the adjusted ebit debt service ratio is the ratio of i adjusted ebit as defined in the first lien credit agreement for the four fiscal quarters ending on such date to ii w cash interest expense  plus x the current portion of capitalized leases for the following four fiscal quarters  plus y the current portion of principal payments of debt as defined in the first lien credit agreement excluding payments under the revolving credit notes under the first lien credit agreement  required to be paid for the following four fiscal quarters plus z dividends paid by wsi to or for the benefit of wca waste to be used to pay the debt of wca waste 
the required minimum adjusted ebit debt service ratio under the first lien credit agreement starts at a minimum of to from the closing date until the fiscal quarter ending september  and must be at least to at all times thereafter 
the leverage ratio is measured at the level of wca waste and all of its subsidiaries  while the senior debt leverage ratio  adjusted ebit debt service ratio and all other financial ratios and tests are measured only from the level of wsi and its subsidiaries and exclude wca waste and other entities above wsi 
under the first lien credit agreement  there is no limit for acquisition or expansion capital expenditures provided that the leverage ratio remains below to and million is available under the revolving credit facility after the applicable expenditure 
however  if the leverage ratio exceeds to  the amount of an 
table of contents acquisition expenditure shall be limited to of wca waste s net worth unless expenditures above that amount are approved by a majority of the lenders 
the second lien credit agreement contains obligations  covenants and restrictions similar to the first lien credit agreement  and the same are designed to work together  provided  the financial ratios and tests in the second lien credit agreement are slightly more favorable to wsi  meaning that any violation of these tests or ratios would  in all probability  result in a default under the first lien credit agreement before a default occurs under the second lien credit agreement 
other covenants in the credit agreements limit our ability and certain of our subsidiaries to  among other things i create  incur  assume or permit to exist certain liens  ii make certain investments  loans and advances  iii enter into any sale leaseback transactions  iv materially change the nature of our business  v create  incur  assume or permit to exist certain leases  vi merge into or with or consolidate with any other person  vii sell  lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our property or assets  viii discount or sell any of our notes or accounts receivable  ix transact business with affiliates unless in the ordinary course of business and on arm s length basis  x make certain negative pledges  and xi amend  supplement or otherwise modify the terms of any debt or prepay  redeem or repurchase any subordinated debt 
included in such covenants is a prohibition against the payment of cash dividends by wsi to wca waste or any intermediary except for the limited purposes of debt repayment  meaning wca waste has very limited sources of cash 
wca waste s only source of cash to pay dividends is distributions from its subsidiaries and  therefore  its ability to declare or pay future cash dividends on its common stock would be subject to  among other factors  a relaxation of this prohibition 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
other financing sources other sources of financing that we have used in connection with our acquisition program include issuing debt or equity to the sellers 
as of december   we had million of seller notes outstanding of which million is convertible into shares of our common stock 
during the year ended december   in connection with four acquisition  we issued  shares of common stock 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands 
the contractual obligations do not include interest payments on long term debt due to the variable interest rates under our credit facility and the varying amounts outstanding under our credit facility during the year 
the contractual interest rate for our credit facility is the libor base rate plus a stipulated margin  which also fluctuates based on our leverage ratio 
for the year ended december   our cash paid for interest expense was million 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements for balances and terms of our credit facility at december  payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt principal amount outstanding closure and post closure costs operating lease note payable total related interest obligations have been excluded from this maturity schedule 
the closure and post closure costs amounts included reflect the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   without the impact of discounting and inflation 
we believe the amount and timing of these activities are reasonably estimable 
the cost in current dollars is inflated at december 
table of contents  until the expected time of payment  and then discounted to present value at december  
accretion expense is then applied to the closure and post closure liability based on the effective interest method and is included in cost of services 
our recorded closure and post closure liabilities will increase as we continue to place additional volumes within the permitted airspace at our landfills 
other commitments as of december   we had the following other commitments in thousands commitment expiration by period less more than than other commitments total year years years years financial surety bonds standby letters of credit total we use financial surety bonds for landfill closure and post closure financial assurance required under certain environmental regulations and may use other mechanisms including insurance  letters of credit and restricted cash deposits 
we have experienced less availability of surety bonds for landfill closure and post closure requirements and increased costs including the direct fees associated with the bonds  increased levels of standby letters of credit or personal guarantees provided to the surety bond underwriters 
our commitments for financial surety bonds are not recorded in our financial statements 
our surety bonds relate to closure and post closure obligations relating to our landfills and would not create debt unless and until we closed such landfills and were unable to satisfy closure and post closure obligations 
we provide standby letters of credit to the surety bond underwriters as discussed in note above 
as of december   million had been provided to the surety bond underwriters 
we also provide standby letters of credit and restricted cash deposits to our insurance underwriters for the self insured portion of outstanding claims 
as of december   we had provided million in standby letters of credit 
in january  a total of million was cancelled  leaving million outstanding 
our commitments for standby letters of credit are not recorded in our financial statements 
the standby letters of credit relate to the portion of claims covered by insurance policies as to which we had retained responsibility and would not create debt unless we were unable to satisfy such claims from our operating income 
however  we currently satisfy such claims from our cash flows from operations 
if our current surety bond underwriters are unwilling to renew existing bonds upon expiration  or are unwilling to issue additional bonds as needed  or if we are unable to obtain surety bonds through new underwriters as such needs arise  we would need to arrange other means of financial assurance  such as restricted cash deposits or a letter of credit 
while such alternate assurance has been available  it may result in additional expense or capital outlays 
we accrue claims related to our self insurance programs based on claims filed  estimated open claims and claims incurred but not reported based on actuarial based loss development factors 
as of december   we had accrued million for these claims 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our limited history  our estimates could be materially affected 
cash flows the following is a summary of our cash balances and cash flows for the years ended december   and in thousands years ended december  cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities 
table of contents cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to the change from net loss of million during the year ended december  to net income of million during the year ended december  and the non cash charges included in those results 
cash used in investing activities consist primarily of cash used for capital expenditures and the acquisition of businesses 
cash used for capital expenditures  including acquisitions  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
acquisitions of businesses in accounted for million of the increase over during  we received million in proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations 
we expect capital expenditures related to our existing operations for to be approximately of our revenue 
these expenditures include the cost of vehicles  heavy equipment  containers  landfill cell development and certain systems and program improvements 
furthermore  in connection with the execution of our acquisition strategy  we expect to make substantial capital expenditures 
because of their nature  we cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of these acquisition expenditures 
we believe that we will have the necessary financial sources available to fund our capital expenditures and our acquisition program 
these sources include the use of borrowings under our existing credit facility  seller notes  and the issuance of new debt or equity 
cash provided by used in financing activities during the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities during the years ended december   and includes borrowings under our credit facilities  repayments of debt and financing costs associated with amendments to our credit facility in all periods  and distributions to our former parent in prior periods 
proceeds from financing include the net proceeds from the use of our credit facilities and seller notes 
the increase in net cash from investing activities in as compared to that in reflects the amounts borrowed related to our ongoing acquisition program 
the increase in as compared to that in reflects the impact of proceeds of our initial public offering in june which was used to repay outstanding borrowings 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
landfill accounting capitalized landfill costs as of december   we owned msw landfills and c d landfills 
one msw landfill and one c d landfill are fully permitted but not constructed and have not yet commenced operations 
capitalized landfill costs include expenditures for the acquisition of land and airspace  engineering and permitting costs  cell construction costs and direct site improvement costs 
as of december   no capitalized interest had been included in capitalized landfill costs 
however  in the future interest could be capitalized on landfill construction projects but only during the period the assets are undergoing activities to ready them for their intended use 
capitalized landfill costs are amortized ratably using the units of production method over the estimated useful life of the site as airspace of the landfill is consumed 
landfill amortization rates are determined periodically not less than annually based on aerial and ground surveys and other density measures and estimates made by our internal and or third party engineers 
total available airspace includes the total of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace that we believe is likely to be permitted 
where we believe permit expansions are probable  the expansion airspace  and the projected costs related to developing the expansion airspace are included in the 
table of contents airspace amortization rate calculation 
the criteria we use to determine if permit expansion is probable include but  are not limited to  whether we believe that the project has fatal flaws  the land is owned or controlled by us  or under option agreement  we have committed to the expansion  financial analysis has been completed  and the results indicate that the expansion has the prospect of a positive financial and operational impact  personnel are actively working to obtain land use  local  and state approvals for an expansion of an existing landfill  we believe the permit is likely to be received  and we believe that the timeframe to complete the permitting is reasonable 
we may be unsuccessful in obtaining expansion permits for airspace that has been considered probable 
if unsuccessful in obtaining these permits  the previously capitalized costs will be charged to expense 
as of december   we have included million cubic yards of expansion airspace with estimated development costs of approximately million in our calculation of the rates used for the amortization of landfill costs 
closure and post closure obligations we have material financial commitments for the costs associated with our future obligations for final closure  which is the closure of the landfill  the capping of the final uncapped areas of a landfill and post closure maintenance of those facilities  which is generally expected to be for a period of up to years for msw facilities and up to five years for c d facilities 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 which provides standards for accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
generally  the requirements for recording closure and post closure obligations under sfas no 
are as follows landfill closure and post closure liabilities are calculated by estimating the total obligation in current dollars 
cost estimates equate the costs of third parties performing the work 
any portion of the estimates which are based on activities being performed internally are increased to reflect a profit margin a third party would receive to perform the same activity 
this profit margin will be taken to income once the work is performed internally 
the total obligation is carried at the net present value of future cash flows  which is calculated by inflating the obligation based upon the expected date of the expenditure using an inflation rate and discounting the inflated total to its present value using a discount rate 
the discount rate represents our credit adjusted risk free rate 
the resulting closure and post closure obligation is recorded as an increase in this liability as airspace is consumed 
accretion expense is calculated based on the discount rate and is charged to cost of services and increases the related closure and post closure obligation 
this expense will generally be less during the early portion of a landfill s operating life and increase thereafter 

table of contents the following table sets forth the rates we used for the amortization of landfill costs and the accrual of closure and post closure costs for  and number of landfills owned landfill depletion and amortization expense in thousands accretion expense in thousands closure and post closure expense in thousands airspace consumed in thousands of cubic yards depletion  amortization  accretion  closure and post closure expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed the impact of changes determined to be changes in estimates  based on an annual update  is accounted for on a prospective basis 
our ultimate liability for such costs may increase in the future as a result of changes in estimates  legislation  or regulations 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination accounted for as a purchase and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their residual values  and reviewed for impairment 
as of december   our goodwill balance was million 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
allocation of acquisition purchase price a summary of our accounting policies for acquisitions is as follows acquisition purchase price is allocated to identified tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to goodwill 
we accrue the payment of contingent purchase price if the events surrounding the contingency are deemed probable 
we often consummate single acquisitions that include a combination of collection operations and landfills 
for each separately identified collection operation and landfill acquired in a single acquisition  we perform an initial allocation of total purchase price to the identified collection operations and landfills based on their relative fair values 
following this initial allocation of total purchase price to the identified collection operations and landfills  we further allocate the identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed for each collection operation and landfill based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to either goodwill or landfill site costs  as discussed above 

table of contents recently adopted accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which revises statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
in general  sfas no 
r does not change the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based awards to employees to be recognized as compensation expense based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
as such  the intrinsic value method permitted by sfas no 
is no longer an alternative 
sfas no 
r must be adopted in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning january   although early adoption in periods in which financial statements or interim reports have not been issued is encouraged 
sfas no 
r allows companies to adopt its provisions using one of the following two transition methods i the modified prospective method  which requires recognition of compensation expense using sfas no 
r for all share based awards granted after the effective date and recognition of compensation expense using sfas no 
for all previously granted share based awards that remain unvested at the effective date 
ii the modified retrospective method  which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method  but also permits companies to restate prior periods on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required by sfas no 
the modified retrospective method may be applied to all prior periods presented or previously reported interim periods of the year of adoption 
we will adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement will have no effect on cash and is not expected to materially impact our overall financial position 
our results of operations have not included recognition of compensation expense for employee stock options because we currently account for share based awards to employees using apb no 
s intrinsic value method 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have no immediate impact on our operating income because there are no unvested stock options outstanding as of the effective date of the adoption 
should we issue options as part of our share based awards in the future  it would have an impact on our operating results though such impact cannot be predicted at this time 
cautionary statement about forward looking statements some of the statements contained in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of from time to time  our public filings  press releases and other communications such as conference calls and presentations will contain forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as may  will  should  outlook  project  forecast  intend  seek  plan  believe  anticipate  expect  estimate  potential  continue  or opportunity  the negatives of these words  or similar words or expressions 
similarly  statements that describe our future plans  objectives or goals are also forward looking statements 
this is true of our description of our acquisition strategy for example 
it is also true of our run rate definitions which are estimates based upon a mixture of historical and projected results 
we caution that forward looking statements are not guarantees and are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
since our business  operations and strategies are subject to a number of risks  uncertainties and other factors  actual results may differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
thus  for example  our future financial performance will depend significantly on our ability to execute our acquisition strategy  which will be subject to many risks and uncertainties including but not limited to the following 
table of contents we may be unable to identify  complete or integrate future acquisitions successfully  we compete for acquisition candidates with other purchasers  some of which have greater financial resources and may be able to offer more favorable terms  revenue and other synergies from acquisitions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected  we may not be able to improve internalization rates by directing waste volumes from acquired businesses to our landfills for regulatory  business or other reasons  businesses that we acquire may have unknown liabilities and require unforeseen capital expenditures  changes or disruptions associated with making acquisitions may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired businesses  in connection with financing acquisitions  we may incur additional indebtedness  or may issue additional shares of our common stock which would dilute the ownership percentage of existing stockholders  and rapid growth may strain our management  operational  financial and other resources 
our business is also subject to a number of operational risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results of operations  or our financial condition  to differ from any forward looking statements 
these include  but are not limited to  the following we may not be able to obtain or maintain the permits necessary for operation and expansion of our existing landfills or landfills that we might acquire or develop  our costs may increase for  or we may be unable to provide  necessary financial assurances to governmental agencies under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfills  governmental regulations may require increased capital expenditures or otherwise affect our business  our business is capital intensive  requiring ongoing cash outlays that may strain or consume our available capital and we may not always have access to the additional capital that we require to execute our growth strategy  possible changes in our estimates of site remediation requirements  final capping  closure and post closure obligations  compliance  regulatory developments and insurance costs  the effect of limitations or bans on disposal or transportation of out of state waste or certain categories of waste  increases in the costs of disposal  labor and fuel could reduce operating margins  increases in costs of insurance or failure to maintain full coverage could reduce operating income  we are subject to environmental and safety laws  which restrict our operations and increase our costs  and may impose significant unforeseen liabilities  
table of contents we compete with large companies and municipalities with greater financial and operational resources  and we also compete with alternatives to landfill disposal  covenants in our credit facilities and the instruments governing our other indebtedness may limit our ability to grow our business and make capital expenditures  changes in interest rates may affect our results of operations  a downturn in us economic conditions or the economic conditions in our markets may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations  failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price  and our success depends on key members of our senior management  the loss of any of whom could disrupt our customer and business relationships and our operations 
we describe these and other risks in greater detail in the section entitled business risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
we refer you to that section for additional information 
the forward looking statements included in this report are only made as of the date of this report and we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances
