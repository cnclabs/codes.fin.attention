we do not assume any obligation to revise or update forward looking statements 
finally  our historic results should not be viewed as indicative of future performance 
overview our company and business model quest software  inc delivers innovative products that help it organizations get more performance from their computing environment 
our product areas are application management  database management and infrastructure management 
the focus of our products is based upon generating higher levels of performance  manageability and productivity throughout our customers it infrastructure and with products and services that enable them to manage the investments they have made within their it environment 
our initial core competency as a database management company enabled us to extend into the application management market as the architecture behind new applications leveraged the powerful back end processing requirements of large complex databases 
as we expanded our presence into new markets  and as the microsoft platform became ubiquitous 
table of contents within our customer base  we developed expertise within the windows market through the initial acquisition of fastlane technologies and then aelita software combined with internal development success 
during  we continued to broaden and accelerate our focus within both the database management and infrastructure management markets with the recent acquisitions of imceda  vintela and wingra 
our revenue consists primarily of software license fees and post contract technical support fees from customers 
our software licensing model is primarily based on perpetual license fees  and our license fees are typically calculated either on a per server basis or a per seat basis 
post contract technical support contracts entitle a customer to telephone or internet support and unspecified maintenance releases  updates and enhancements 
first year maintenance contracts are typically sold with the related perpetual software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter at the customer s option 
annual post contract technical support renewal fees are priced as a percentage of the net initial license fee of a perpetual license and first year maintenance 
revenue is allocated to post contract technical support based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and amortized over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months 
we also provide professional consulting and training services  which relate to installation of our products and do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
revenue is allocated to professional consulting and training services based on vsoe of fair value and recognized as the services are performed 
such revenues represent  and of total services revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
we invest heavily in research and development in order to design  develop and enhance a wide variety of products and technologies that will be attractive to customers 
in addition  we are primarily a direct sales driven organization that expends significant selling costs in order to secure new customer license sales and the follow on post contract technical support revenue stream that can continue forward beyond the initial license sale 
our results as discussed in more detail throughout our md a from to  total revenues increased to million and total expenses increased to million  resulting in operating margin of 
income from operations increased from million to million and net income decreased from million to million 
our infrastructure management products were the primary product contributors to revenue growth from to our database code quality and optimization product family also contributed significantly to total revenues and revenue growth in geographically  our north american operations were the largest contributor to license and services revenue dollar growth from to however  license and services revenues outside of north america grew at a higher overall percentage rate than north america in these periods 
sales of perpetual software licenses  post contract technical support and professional consulting and training services from acquired company products were significant contributors to revenue growth in the contribution from these acquired companies to our total revenue growth in was approximately million or 
results of operations from all acquisitions are included in our consolidated income statements from the respective dates of acquisition 
for more information concerning our acquisitions during the periods presented herein  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
when comparing our results of operations to  note that the twelve month period ended december  included approximately million in total revenues  the majority of which was services revenue  from our vista plus output management product line  which we sold in september in connection with this asset disposition  we also recorded a gain of million  which was classified as pretax operating income in our consolidated income statement 
our primary expenses are our personnel costs  which include compensation and benefits and costs of office facilities and travel and entertainment  which are a function of our world wide headcount 
we 
table of contents estimate that these personnel related costs represented approximately of total expenses in our headcount at the end of fiscal was approximately  compared to approximately  at the end of fiscal while currency fluctuations between and significantly impacted our other income expense  net  as described in the comparison below  currency fluctuations did not materially affect our income from operations in expectations for in  we expect to continue to grow licenses and services revenues 
we expect this growth to continue to be weighted toward a stronger third and fourth quarter  similar to the last several years 
this generally means that operating income margins are expected to be lower than the full year average in early quarters and higher than average in the third and fourth quarters 
we plan to expand our investment within our sales  marketing and research and development organizations to supplement our current efforts and drive for growth over the next few years 
in the sales arena  we will be increasing sales headcount by building upon the efficiencies and success within our telesales organization and also expanding our field activities with our key partners 
within research and development  we will continue investing to further realize the benefits from offshore development in lower cost geographies 
we plan to incrementally broaden our resources to focus on delivering management products for a new set of technologies 
lastly  we plan to increase our investment in the asia pacific region 
although our investments in a broader field sales presence have generally been successful  most notably in europe  there can be no assurance that future efforts will achieve the same result 
an element of our business strategy involves the acquisition of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to reduce the time required to develop new technologies and products and bring them to market  incorporate enhanced functionality into and complement our existing product offerings  augment our engineering workforce  and or enhance our technological capabilities 
we plan to continue to evaluate strategic opportunities as they arise  including acquisitions and other business combination transactions  strategic relationships  strategic investments in private companies and the purchase of assets 
under the new accounting rules for stock based compensation  we will begin to expense unvested and newly granted stock options beginning january  this will substantially increase our stock based compensation expense  a non cash expense  and will substantially reduce our operating margins 
as discussed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements  inclusion of the compensation cost related to the fair value of stock option grants in our financial results would have reduced net income from million to million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their grant date fair values and does not allow the previously permitted disclosure only method as an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
we adopted this new standard on january  sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all stock based payments granted after 
table of contents the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above but also permits restatement using amounts previously disclosed under the pro forma provisions of sfas either for a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we plan to use the modified prospective method of adoption and for purposes of estimating the compensation cost of our option grants the fair value of each option grant will be estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the adoption of the sfas r fair value method will have a significant adverse impact on our reported results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the balance of unearned stock based compensation to be expensed in the period through related to stock based awards unvested at december   as previously calculated under the disclosure only requirements of sfas adjusted for estimated forfeitures  is approximately million 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
we anticipate we will grant additional employee stock options in the fair value of these grants is not included in the amount above  as the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the number of shares awarded as part of those grants and the then current fair values 
had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the magnitude of the impact of that standard on our results of operations would have approximated the impact of sfas assuming the application of the black scholes option pricing model as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and pro forma net income loss per share in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement may reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after its adoption 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future  the amount of operating cash flows recognized related to such excess tax deductions was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding other recent accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies and estimates have not differed materially from actual results 
our significant accounting policies are presented within note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the related disclosures 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
our revenue recognition policy is one of our critical accounting policies because revenue is a key component of our results of operations and is based on complex rules that require us to make significant judgments and estimates 
in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue are recognized currently generally perpetual software licenses and which portions must be deferred generally post contract technical support and professional consulting and training services 
in addition  we analyze various factors including our pricing policies  the credit worthiness of our customers  accounts receivable aging data and contractual terms and conditions in helping us make judgments about revenue recognition 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue and costs recognized 
we derive revenues from three primary sources perpetual software licenses  annual maintenance and support services referred to as post contract technical support and professional consulting and training services 
we license our products primarily through our direct sales force and  increasingly  our telesales force 
for these sales  we utilize written contracts as the means to establish the terms and conditions upon which our products and services are sold to our end customers 
we also sell our products indirectly through resellers and distributors 
for these indirect sales transactions  we accept orders from our resellers and distributors when they have existing  valid orders from an end customer 
we utilize written contracts coupled with purchase orders as the means to establish the terms and conditions of  and to initiate sales for  these indirect sales transactions 
we initially capture value for our products by selling a perpetual software license to end customers 
the fee for the first year of post contract technical support is included in  or bundled with  the perpetual software license at the time of initial sale 
as such  the combination at initial sale of a perpetual software license and one year of post contract technical support represents a multiple element arrangement for revenue recognition purposes 
we account for the perpetual software license component of these multiple element arrangements using the residual method  which requires recognition of the perpetual software license revenue once all software products have been delivered to the end customer and the only undelivered elements are post contract technical support and or professional consulting and training services 
value of the undelivered elements is determined based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value and is deferred 
the residual value  after allocation of the fee to the undelivered elements based on vsoe of fair value  is then allocated to the perpetual software license for the software products being sold 
our post contract technical support vsoe of fair value is determined by reference to the prices our end customers pay for this support when it is sold separately  that is  when we enter into an arms length  annual renewal transaction with end customers where the only offering sold is post contract technical support 
these standalone post contract technical support renewal transactions are typically for one year in duration and are priced as a targeted percentage of the initial  discounted purchase price 
we bill these renewal transactions in advance of the services provided 
we also offer end customers the right to purchase post contract technical support for multiple annual periods beyond the first year 
our professional consulting and training services vsoe of fair value is determined by reference to our established pricing and discounting practices for these services when sold separately 
our professional consulting and training services are typically sold as time and materials based contracts that range from five to fifteen days in duration 
we sell professional consulting and training services both standalone and as part of multiple element arrangements 
our vsoe of fair value is impacted by estimates and judgments that  if significantly different  could materially impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in current and future periods 
these estimates 
table of contents and judgments include  among other items  the ability to identify and validate vsoe of fair value for undelivered elements via the use of sampling techniques  the fair value of that undelivered element and where a customer s post contract technical support renewal is in its product life cycle when numerous year s renewal efforts have been combined into one transaction a co term 
historically  we have been able to establish vsoe of fair value for post contract technical support and professional consulting and training services but we may modify our pricing and discounting practices in the future 
this could result in changes to our vsoe of fair value for these undelivered elements 
if this were to occur  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements would differ significantly from our historical results 
if we were unable to support at all through vsoe the fair value of our post contract technical support  the entire amount of revenue from our initial  upfront sale of both a perpetual software license bundled with one year of post contract technical support would be deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
in addition to perpetual software licenses  we sell a small amount of time based software licenses or term licenses each year 
approximately of total revenue was generated by these time based software licenses wherein customers pay a single fee for the right to use the software and receive post contract technical support for a defined period of time 
all license and support revenues on these term licenses are deferred and recognized ratable over the license term 
when all four of our revenue recognition criteria are met as explained in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements  the multiple element aspect of our arrangements means the only revenue recognized upfront  at the time of initial sale  is the residual revenue allocated to the perpetual software license 
the revenue associated with the undelivered post contract technical support and or professional consulting and training services included in the initial sale is deferred and is subsequently recorded to revenue ratably over the support term and as such services are performed  respectively 
revenue for our standalone sale of annual post contract technical support renewals in years two  three and beyond is recognized ratably over the support term 
sales of post contract technical support for multiple annual periods are treated similarly 
revenue from our professional consulting and training services is recognized as contracted work is performed as agreed with end customers unless the statement of work sow specifies alternate treatment 
indirect sales  which are a small portion of our historical transaction volume  are generally handled via a process and rules that are similar to an end customer sale 
however  we typically defer revenue recognition on indirect sales transactions of significant size until receipt of payment unless we have a payment history with the reseller or distributor with no late payment experiences 
for additional information regarding our revenue recognition accounting policies see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset valuation asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for sales returns and cancellations as well as an allowance for bad debt 
regarding our allowance for sales returns and cancellations  our standard form license and post contract technical support and or service agreements do not typically or expressly provide for product returns or cancellations as a matter of right unless we have breached the product warranty and are unable to cure the breach 
our product warranties are typical industry warranties that a product will perform in accordance with established product requirements 
however  we maintain the sales returns and cancellations allowance to cover the circumstances where the company accepts returns or cancellations on a discretionary basis even though not contractually obligated to do so 
this 
table of contents allowance covers estimated losses for our customer s unwillingness to make required payments 
the allowance for bad debt is for estimated losses resulting from our customer s inability to make required payments related to enforceable contracts 
to support both these allowances  we are required to make significant estimates of future software license returns  of cancellations for both post contract technical support and of professional consulting and training services  and of write offs of customer accounts as bad debts all related to current period revenues 
the amount of our reserves is based on these estimates  the contractual terms and conditions of our contracts  our accounts receivable aging  our historical experience  and our current analysis of the credit worthiness of our customers and the collectability of our accounts receivable 
as a percentage of total revenues  charges against these two reserves were and in the years ended december  and  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their unwillingness or inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
additionally  if significant product performance issues were to arise resulting in our accepting sales returns  additional allowances may be required which would result in a reduction of revenue in the period such determination was made 
given our warranty approach  we have not historically seen this type of significant product performance issue 
while such return  cancellation and bad debt write off amounts have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same future performance that we have in the past 
goodwill goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
we performed our annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of and determined that the carrying value of each reporting unit was less than the estimated fair value of the reporting units 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units licenses and services  the market approach and income approach were the methodologies deemed the most reliable and were the primary methods used for our impairment analysis 
we will continue to perform annual impairment reviews during the fourth quarter of each year  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
future impairment reviews could result in significant charges against earnings to write down the value of goodwill 
intangible assets these assets are recorded at their appraised value and amortized using the straight line method over estimated useful lives between two years and seven years 
the net carrying amount of other intangible assets was considered recoverable at december  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  these intangible assets are reviewed for events or changes in circumstances  which indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we periodically review the carrying value of these assets to determine whether or not impairment to such value has occurred 
in the event that in the future it is determined that the other intangible assets value has been impaired  an adjustment will be made in that corresponding period resulting in a charge against earnings for the write down 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires a significant amount of judgment  estimation and uncertainty and our estimate of income taxes can be highly sensitive to shifts between such tax jurisdictions 
additionally  our u 
s and foreign tax returns are subject to routine compliance reviews by the various tax authorities 
although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that could result from the examination of our tax returns 
determining the income tax expense for such contingencies requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation 
we evaluate such tax contingencies in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and have accrued for income tax contingencies that meet both the probable and estimable criteria of sfas no 
these estimates are updated over time as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities  completion of tax audits  expiration of statutes of 
table of contents limitation  or upon occurrence of other events 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of such contingencies could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
the tax contingency accrual is recorded as a component of our net income taxes payable receivable balance 
we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such deferred income taxes primarily relate to the timing of the recognition of certain revenue items and the timing of the deductibility of certain reserves and accruals for income tax purposes 
we regularly review the deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time periods within which the underlying timing differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which could result in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
us income taxes were not provided for on undistributed earnings from certain non us subsidiaries 
those earnings are considered permanently reinvested

table of contents comparison of fiscal years ended december  and revenues total revenues and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except for percentages increase dollars percentage revenues licenses north america rest of world total license revenues services north america rest of world total service revenues total revenues licenses revenues growth in license revenues is primarily a result of increased software license sales within our infrastructure management and database management product lines  which increased by approximately and  respectively  from the twelve months of to the comparable period in approximately  or million  of to license revenue growth derived from license revenues from products acquired in services revenues the largest component of services revenues is post contract technical support revenue 
services revenues also include fees for professional consulting and training services 
our infrastructure management product line and our code quality and optimization products primarily drove growth in services revenues 
service revenues from these product categories increased by approximately million 
post contract technical support revenues from renewals of annual maintenance agreements have continued to grow and revenues from professional consulting and training services increased million or 
professional consulting and training services as a percentage of total service revenues represented approximately and in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
our north american operating results for the first three quarters of included approximately million in services revenues from our vista plus output management product line  which we sold in september excluding the vista plus service revenues from our results  our north american service revenues increased by 
as our software post contract technical support customer base grows  our post contract technical support renewal rate has a larger influence on the growth rate of overall revenues 
therefore  the growth rate of overall revenues does not necessarily correlate directly to the growth rate of new software license revenues in a given period 
the primary determinant of post contract technical support revenue growth is the rate at which our customers renew their annual maintenance agreements 
if our post contract technical support renewal rates were to decline materially  our post contract technical support revenues and total revenues would likely decline materially as well 
although we do not currently expect our post contract technical support renewal rates to deteriorate  there can be no assurance they will not

table of contents marketing programs 
personnel related costs  such as labor  commissions  bonuses  vacation  travel  reward programs and payroll taxes increased approximately million 
the increase to personnel related expense is primarily due to significant growth in headcount  including the additional headcount from the acquisitions of imceda and vintela  and to increased commissions on higher revenue growth 
marketing communications  programs  conferences  and road trade show expenses increased by approximately million

comparison of fiscal years ended december  and revenues total revenues and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except for percentages increase dollars percentage revenues licenses north america rest of world total license revenues services north america rest of world total service revenues total revenues licenses revenues growth in license revenues for the twelve months ended december   is primarily a result of robust sales within our infrastructure management product line and development and deployment products within our database management product line 
the license revenue contribution from the acquired aelita products was less identifiable because we created product suites comprising both aelita and quest windows infrastructure solutions products and because in some cases aelita products had replaced comparable quest products 
we nonetheless estimated that acquired aelita products contributed approximately of the million license revenues growth from to we also noted particular strength of the sales of aelita products in emea 
the infrastructure management products represented approximately of total software license sales for the year ended december  software license sales of our development and deployment products increased approximately from to  and these products also showed particular strength in europe 
a major new release of our code quality and optimization product was a primary driver of license revenues growth in this product line

the primary contributors to this reduction were cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  and capital expenditures  including the purchase and build out of a second building at our aliso viejo  california corporate headquarters 
the cash consumption from these two sources was only partially offset by cash flow from operating activities 
operating activities our primary source of cash flow from operating activities is cash collections from our customers whereas our primary use of cash flow from operating activities is for compensation and personnel related expenditures 
cash flow from operations has increased during the last two years 
during and the substantial changes in our cash flows from operating activities were primarily driven by i net income from operations  ii depreciation and amortization costs  representing non cash expenses of million and million in the and periods  respectively  iii the tax benefit for stock option exercises  iv a cash use totaling million in related to a litigation settlement  and v changes in working capital 
working capital changes mostly driven by deferred revenue made up of net cash inflows of million and million in the and periods  respectively represent the receipt of cash payments for post contract technical support  which will be delivered over the coming twelve month period

these furniture and build out expenditures include significant it hardware and software purchases related to the move and improvement of our corporate data center 
the two buildings comprise approximately  square feet of space 
financing activities our primary source of cash from financing activities was for issuances of our common stock under employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
our primary use of cash from financing activities was to pay off the repurchase agreements as described below that we use from time to time to temporarily fund acquisitions 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in from was primarily due to net proceeds of million from a repurchase agreement in as compared to net payments on repurchase agreements of million in a secondary contributor was a decrease of million in proceeds from stock option exercises 
proceeds received from our stock option plans were million and million in and  respectively 
proceeds received from our employee stock purchase plan were approximately million in our board of directors terminated the employee stock purchase plan effective july  we entered into a repurchase agreement in march utilizing million of our investment securities as collateral 
the cash proceeds of this transaction were used to provide funding for our acquisition of aelita and our purchase of a new office facility in aliso viejo  california 
our remaining obligation under this agreement was paid in full in february in july we entered into another repurchase agreement utilizing million of our investment securities as collateral 
the cash proceeds of this transaction were used to provide funding for our acquisition of vintela 
our remaining obligation under this agreement was paid in full in december in december  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to five million shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock under this program for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
no shares of common stock have been repurchased under this program since we completed our repatriation activity under the american jobs creation act ajca during this effort resulted in the tax efficient  one time return of million cash for funding acquisitions  purchase of real property  funding for research and development related activities and infrastructure and capital investments 
as indicated in our cash flow from investing activities section above  acquisitions are part of our business model 
as such  we plan to continue to use current available cash or potentially future cash flow generated from operating activities to fund acquisition and related equity investments 
we have also utilized significant amounts of cash the last several years to acquire and build out two buildings at our new corporate headquarters site in aliso viejo  california 
this facility and headquarters work is now essentially complete 
in the future  we expect to continue to generate positive net cash flow from operating activities 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  investment balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance our cash needs through at least the next months 
any cash generation from operating activities that is not utilized for acquisition activity or for capital expenditures would be invested in short and long term marketable securities consistent with past investment practices 
our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to substantial risks described under the caption risk factors 
one of these risks is that our future business does not stay at a level that is similar to  or better than  our recent past 
should a general economic downturn or similar event occur  or should the company s internal 
table of contents development activity or acquisition investments leave us with uncompetitive products that are not attractive to end customers  we may be unable to generate or sustain positive cash flow from operating activities 
we would then be required to use existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances to fund daily operations as well as to support our working capital and other cash needs 
in addition  we may choose to use cash in the future for additional acquisitions or strategic investments 
if any or all these events were to occur  additional funds may be required to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes 
we may be forced to seek to re institute our repurchase facility  raise funds through public or private equity or obtain debt financing from other sources 
we can provide no assurance that this additional financing will be available at all or  if available  that we would be able to obtain it on terms favorable to us 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december   our contractual obligations or commercial commitments include our facility lease commitments and operating leases for office facilities and certain items of equipment 
in addition  we are committed to pay additional capital contributions to a private equity fund totaling million as capital calls are made 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that could reduce our liquidity 
the following table summarizes our obligations as of december  and the effect we expect such obligations to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk we are a us dollar functional company and transact business in a number of different foreign countries around the world 
in most instances  revenues are collected and operating expenses are paid in the local currency of the country in which we are transacting 
accordingly  we are exposed to both transaction and translation risk relating to changes in foreign exchange rates 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is composed of the combination of our foreign net profits and losses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as well as our net balances of monetary assets and liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses depending on the directional movement of the foreign currencies versus the us dollar and our operational profile in foreign subsidiaries 
our cumulative currency gains or losses in any given period may be lessened by the economic benefits of diversification and low correlation between different currencies  but there can be no assurance that this pattern will continue to be true in future periods 
the foreign currencies to which we currently have the most significant exposure are the euro  the canadian dollar  the british pound and the australian dollar 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposures  nor do we use such instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we regularly monitor the potential cost and benefits of hedging foreign exchange exposures with derivatives and there remains the possibility that our foreign exchange hedging practices could change accordingly in time 

table of contents interest rate risk our exposure to market interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge the market risks of our investments 
we place our investments with high quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the united states government and its agencies 
our investments in marketable securities consist primarily of investment grade bonds and united states government and agency securities 
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
we classify all of our investments as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in a separate component of shareholders equity 
generally we plan to hold our investments to maturity and therefore changes in the market interest rate would not have a material affect on the fair value of such investments 
however  during the second quarter of we sold million of our investments prior to maturity to fund the imceda acquisition and to complete the purchase of a second building in aliso viejo  california resulting in an immaterial loss on the fair market value of the investments 
our remaining investment positions and duration of the portfolio would not be materially affected by a basis point shift in interest rates 
information about our investment portfolio is presented in the table below  which states the amortized book value and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity in thousands amortized book value weighted average rate investments maturing by december  a thereafter total portfolio a includes cash and cash equivalents of million 
we maintain a level of cash and cash equivalents such that we have generally been able to hold our investments to maturity 
accordingly  changes in the market interest rate would not have a material effect on the carrying value of such investments
