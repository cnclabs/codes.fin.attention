item business 
overview we are a medical device company focused on the design  development and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders 
our product portfolio is focused on applications for lumbar and cervical spine fusion  a market estimated to exceed billion in the us in our principal product offering includes a minimally disruptive surgical platform called maximum access surgery  or mas tm  as well as classic fusion implants 
our products are used predominantly in spine fusion surgeries  both to enable access to the spine and to perform restorative and fusion procedures 
we also focus significant efforts on our research and development pipeline emphasizing both mas and motion preservation products such as total disc replacement and nucleus like cervical disc replacement 
as of december   we have trained surgeons in the use of our products 
our mas platform combines three categories of our product offerings neurovision a proprietary software driven nerve avoidance system  maxcess a unique split blade design retraction system providing enhanced surgical access to the spine  and specialized implants  like our spherx pedicle screw system  coroent suite of products and new extensure tm dynamic stabilization and fusion system 
we believe our mas platform provides a unique and comprehensive solution for safe and reproducible minimally disruptive surgical treatment of spine disorders by enabling surgeons to access the spine in a manner that affords direct visibility and avoidance of critical nerves 
our mas platform enables a variety of spine surgery procedures and also uniquely enables an innovative procedure known as extreme lateral interbody fusion  or xlif  in which surgeons access the spine from the side of the patient s body  rather than from the 
table of contents front or back of the body 
our maxcess instruments provide access to the spine in a manner that affords direct visibility and our neurovision system allows surgeons to avoid critical nerves 
we believe that the procedures facilitated by our mas platform reduce operating times  decrease trauma and blood loss  and lead to faster overall patient recovery times 
our classic fusion portfolio is comprised of a range of products  including bone allografts in our patented saline packaging  which are human bone that has been processed and precision shaped for transplant 
our classic fusion portfolio also includes fusion plates such as our smartplate gradient clp tm 
in  we relocated to a  square foot  state of the art facility  which has a six suite cadaver operating theatre as well as warehousing and distribution capabilities 
we believe our new facility positions us for continued momentum in surgeon training and adoption of our products 
recent product introductions since late  we have introduced twelve new products and product enhancements that have significantly upgraded our mas platform and increased our revenue opportunities for each surgery performed using our products 
we have also acquired complementary and strategic assets and technology 
our newly launched products include spherx dual ball rod dbr tm a pedicle screw system that allows for instrument free compression of the vertebrae  minimizes the incidence of tissue trauma associated with rod overhang and effects secure rod placement with minimal rod migration 
spherx pedicle screw system a pedicle screw system designed for a posterior approach involving a minimally disruptive procedure 
smartplate gradient clp a dynamic cervical plate that encompasses a gradient locking mechanism enabling the screws to be progressively resistant to axial compression 
this allows the plate to settle in concert with the eventual allograft implant settling that occurs within the disc space over time  offering a better anatomical fit 
maxcess micro access system the smallest  lightest version of our maxcess retractor systems  designed to provide access during posterior lumbar and cervical decompression surgeries 
the maxcess micro access system adds more surgical applications to our mas platform by enabling minimally disruptive maximum access approaches for lumbar stenosis decompression  foraminal discectomy and posterior cervical foraminotomy 
maxcess ii a second generation of our maxcess retractor that incorporates neurovision within the posterior retraction blade  providing built in nerve monitoring capabilities  and features superior and inferior blades that kick out at an angle 
the superior and inferior blades spread the tissue closest to the pathology point further than original maxcess 
extensure an interspinous dynamic stabilization and fusion system 
this device utilizes an allograft implant to maintain decompression through a more natural restoration of the spinal anatomy 
extensure was officially launched with limited availability in september and we anticipate a full launch in mid insulated pedicle access system i pas tm a surgical instrument used in conjunction with neurovision to determine the safe  percutaneous approach pathway of a pedicle screw prior to its implantation 
i pas is the first percutaneous and dynamic neurophysiologic system on the market to continuously monitor and alleviate the risk of neurological injury during pedicle screw placement 
coroent large tapered lt  coroent large contoured lc and coroent extra large round xlr implants designed in response to the demand from spine surgeons for implants with superior anatomical fit that are simple to position and align 
the coroent large tapered system is designed to be inserted using a patented insert and rotate technique  which minimizes damage to the surrounding bone 
this procedure allows the surgeon to restore height and stability of the spine 
each 
table of contents of these coroent products is made of peek optima  a biocompatible polymer commonly used in implantable devices 
neurovision nerve root retractor an instrument that combines stimulated and free run electromyography emg to monitor spinal nerves and alert the surgeon of physiologic changes intraoperatively during nerve retraction 
neurovision we have made significant enhancements to our neurovision nerve avoidance system in the form of a software upgrade and improved nerve monitoring capabilities 
the software upgrade incorporates a new graphical user interface that allows for greater ease of use by the surgical staff 
neurovision has also been given a new harness and dual electrodes  or redesigned connectors  to streamline the application of surface electrodes that relay muscle activity to the monitoring system 
our strategy our objective is to become a leading provider of creative medical products that provide comprehensive solutions for the surgical treatment of spine disorders 
we are pursuing the following business strategies in order to achieve this objective establish our mas platform as a standard of care 
we believe our mas platform has the potential to become the standard of care for minimally invasive spine surgery as spine surgeons continue to adopt our products and recognize their benefits 
we also believe that our mas platform has the potential to dramatically improve the clinical results of minimally invasive spine surgery 
we dedicate significant resources to educating spine surgeons on the clinical benefits of our products  and we intend to capitalize on patient demand for minimally disruptive surgical alternatives 
continue to introduce new creative products 
one of our core competencies is our ability to develop and commercialize creative spine surgery products 
since our initial public offering in may  or ipo  we have introduced twelve new products and product enhancements 
we have several additional products currently under development  including total disc and nucleus like replacement devices  mas platform expansion products and other implants designed to stabilize the spine 
we believe that these additional products will allow us to generate  on average  greater revenues per spine surgery procedure while improving patient care 
establish exclusive sales force with broad reach 
we believe that having a sales force dedicated to selling only our spine surgery products is critical to achieve continued growth across product lines  greater market penetration and increased sales 
to that end  we have initiated a process to create an exclusive sales force comprised partially of area business managers  or abms  who are nuvasive employees responsible for a defined territory 
the remainder of the sales force will be exclusive independent distributors  each acting as our sole representative and selling only nuvasive spine products in a given territory 
provide tailored solutions in response to surgeon needs 
responding quickly to the needs of spine surgeons  which we refer to as absolute responsiveness tm  is central to our corporate culture  critical to our success and  we believe  differentiates us from our competition 
we solicit information and feedback from our surgeon customers and clinical advisors regarding the utility of and potential improvements to our products 
for example  we have an on site machine shop to allow us to rapidly manufacture product prototypes and a state of the art cadaver operating theatre to provide clinical training and validate new ideas through prototype testing 
selectively license or acquire complementary spine products and technologies 
in addition to building our company though internal product development efforts  we intend to selectively license or acquire complementary products and technologies 
by acquiring complementary products  we believe we can leverage our expertise at bringing new products to market and provide additional selling opportunities for our sales force 
since our ipo  we have acquired complementary and strategic assets  including cervical plate technology  which we re launched as our smartplate gradient clp product  surgical embroidery technology  including an investigational nucleus like cervical disc replacement 
table of contents device called neodisc tm  and dynamic stabilization technology  which we launched as our extensure product 
industry background and market back pain is the number one cause of healthcare expenditures in the united states  with a direct cost of more than billion annually for diagnosis  treatment and rehabilitation 
the us market for lumbar and cervical spine fusion  the focus of our business  was estimated to be over billion in and over billion in we believe that the market for spine surgery procedures will continue to grow because of the following market dynamics increased use of implants 
the use of implants has evolved into the standard of care in spine surgery 
over the past five years  there has been a significant increase in the percentage of spine fusion surgeries using implants and it is estimated that over of all spine fusion surgeries now involve implants 
demand for minimally invasive alternatives 
as with other surgical markets  we anticipate that the broader acceptance of minimally invasive spine surgery will result in increased demand for these types of surgical procedures 
favorable demographics 
the population segment most likely to experience back pain is expected to increase as a result of aging baby boomers  people born between and we believe this population segment will demand a quicker return to activities of daily living following surgery 
the spine is the core of the human skeleton  and provides a crucial balance between structural support and flexibility 
it consists of separate bones called vertebrae that are connected together by connective tissue to permit a normal range of motion 
the spinal cord  the body s central nerve conduit  is enclosed within the spinal column 
vertebrae are paired into what are called motion segments that move by means of three joints two facet joints and one spine disc 
the four major categories of spine disorders are degenerative conditions  deformities  trauma and tumors 
the largest market and the focus of our business is degenerative conditions of the facet joints and disc space 
these conditions can result in instability and pressure on the nerve roots as they exit the spinal column  causing back pain or radiating pain in the arms or legs 
the prescribed treatment for spine disorders depends on the severity and duration of the disorder 
initially  physicians will prescribe non operative procedures including bed rest  medication  lifestyle modification  exercise  physical therapy  chiropractic care and steroid injections 
in most cases  non operative treatment options are effective  however  many patients require spine surgery 
it is estimated that in excess of one million patients undergo spine surgery each year in the united states 
the most common spine surgery procedures are discectomy  the removal of all or part of a damaged disc  laminectomy  the removal of all or part of a lamina  or thin layer of bone  to relieve pinching of the nerve and narrowing of the spinal canal  and fusion  where two or more adjoining vertebrae are fused together to provide stability 
all three of these procedures require access to the spine 
traditional open surgical approaches require large incisions to be made in the back so that surgeons can see the spine and surrounding area 
most open procedures are invasive  lengthy and complex  and may result in significant blood loss  extensive dissection of tissue and lengthy hospitalization and rehabilitation 
minimally invasive surgical procedures the benefits of minimally invasive surgery procedures in other areas of orthopedics have significantly contributed to the strong and growing demand for minimally invasive surgery of the spine 
surgeons and hospitals seek spine procedures that result in fewer operative complications  shorter surgery times and decreased hospitalization 
at the same time  patients seek procedures that cause less trauma and allow for faster recovery times 
despite these benefits  the rate of adoption of minimally invasive surgical procedures has been relatively slow with respect to the spine 

table of contents we believe the two principal factors contributing to spine surgeons slow adoption of minimally invasive alternatives are the limited or lack of direct access to and visibility of the surgical anatomy  as well as the associated complex instruments that have been required to perform these procedures 
most minimally invasive systems do not allow the surgeon to directly view the spine and provide only restrictive visualization through a camera system or endoscope  while also requiring the use of complex surgical techniques 
in addition  most minimally invasive systems use complex or highly customized surgical instruments that require special training and the completion of a large number of trial cases before the surgeon becomes proficient using the system 
the nuvasive solution maximum access surgery mas our mas platform allows surgeons to perform a wide range of minimally disruptive procedures  while overcoming the shortcomings of alternative minimally invasive surgical techniques 
we believe our products improve clinical results and have both the potential to expand the number of minimally disruptive procedures performed and become a standard of care in spine fusion and non fusion surgery 
our mas platform combines product categories neurovision  maxcess  and specialized implants 
neurovision enables surgeons to avoid neural anatomy while maxcess affords direct customized access to the spine for implant delivery 
maxcess also allows surgeons to use well established traditional instruments in a minimally disruptive and less traumatic manner 
we also offer a variety of specialized implants that enable sufficient structural support while conforming to the anatomical requirements of the patient 
our products facilitate minimally disruptive spine applications of the following traditional spine surgery procedures  among others transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion  or tlif  a lumbar fusion procedure in which the surgeon utilizes an off midline approach through the patient s back  anterior lumbar interbody fusion  or alif  a lumbar fusion procedure in which the surgeon approaches the spine through the patient s abdomen  posterior lumbar interbody fusion  or plif  in which the surgeon approaches the spine through the patient s back  and decompression  which is removal of a portion of bone over the nerve root or disc from under the nerve root to relieve pinching of the nerve 
importantly  our products also enable innovative procedures such as an xlif 
the xlif procedure  which we developed with leading spine surgeons  allows surgeons to access the spine from the side of the patient s body rather than from the front or back  which results in less operating time and reduced patient trauma and blood loss 
notwithstanding these benefits  xlifs have historically been viewed by most surgeons as too difficult to perform due to the number of critical nerves that must be avoided 
we believe procedures enabled by our mas platform have significant benefits  including reduced surgery times  reduced hospital stays  and less trauma and blood loss for the patient  resulting in faster overall patient recovery times 
a study of xlif procedures performed in and supports our belief that our mas platform provides the following benefits reduced surgery times 
xlif procedures utilizing our mas platform  which we refer to as mas xlif  have averaged about minutes to perform which we believe is substantially shorter than it takes to perform an equivalent open procedure 
reduced hospital stays 
hospital stays following a mas xlif procedure have averaged one to two days which we believe is substantially shorter than the hospital stays associated with an equivalent open procedure 
reduced pain and recovery times 
due to smaller incisions and less trauma and blood loss for the patient  we believe that the pain and recovery time for patients following a mas xlif procedure is significantly less than with an equivalent open procedure 
in most cases  patients are walking the same day as surgery following a mas xlif 

table of contents mas neurovision neurovision utilizes electromyography  or emg  and proprietary software algorithms and graphical user interfaces to provide surgeons with an enhanced nerve avoidance system 
our system functions by monitoring changes in electrical signals across muscle groups  which allows us to detect underlying changes in nerve activity 
we connect the instruments that surgeons use to a computer system that provides real time feedback during surgery 
our system analyzes and then translates complex neurophysiologic data into simple  useful information to assist the surgeon s clinical decision making process 
for example  during a pedicle screw test  in which the integrity of the bone where the implant is placed is tested  if the insertion of a screw results in a breach of the bone  a red light and corresponding numeric value will result so that the surgeon may reposition the implant to avoid potential nerve impingement or irritation 
if no breach of the bone occurs  a green light and corresponding numeric value will result 
the initial application of neurovision  screw test with our ins system  was cleared by the fda in november and commercially launched in surgeons can dynamically link familiar surgical instruments to neurovision  thus creating an interactive set of instruments that enable the safe navigation of neural anatomy 
neurovision can be operated independently by the surgeon eliminating the need for additional technical support 
the system s proprietary software and easy to use graphical user interface enables the surgeon to make critical decisions in real time resulting in safer and faster procedures with the potential for improved patient outcomes 
we have recently introduced significant enhancements to neurovision in the form of a software upgrade and improved nerve monitoring capabilities 
the software upgrade incorporates a new graphical user interface that allows for greater ease of use by the surgical staff 
a new harness and dual electrode were developed for neurovision to streamline the application of surface electrodes that relay muscle activity to the monitoring system 
in addition  we introduced the neurovision nerve root retractor  an instrument that combines stimulated and free run emg to monitor spinal nerves and alert the surgeon of physiologic changes intraoperatively during nerve retraction 
mas maxcess our maxcess system consists of instrumentation and specialized implants that provide maximum access with minimal soft tissue disruption 
maxcess has a split blade design consisting of three blades that can be positioned to build the surgical exposure in the shape and size specific to the surgical requirements rather than the fixed tube design of other minimally invasive surgical systems 
maxcess split blade design also provides expanded access to the spine  which allows surgeons to perform surgical procedures using instruments that are similar to those used in open procedures but with a significantly smaller incision 
the ability to use familiar instruments reduces the learning curve and facilitates the adoption of our products 
our system s illumination of the operative corridor aids in providing surgeons with direct visualization of the patient s anatomy  without the need for additional technology or other special equipment 
during the fourth quarter of  we introduced an extension of our maxcess product with our maxcess micro access system 
this brings all of the benefits of minimally disruptive surgery to both the cervical spine for posterior application and the lumbar spine for decompression 
in  we introduced maxcess ii  a second generation of our maxcess retractor that incorporates neurovision within the posterior retraction blade  providing built in nerve monitoring capabilities 
maxcess ii features superior and inferior blades that kick out at an angle to spread the tissue closest to the pathology point further than original maxcess 
maxcess allows surgeons to perform a wide range of conventional spine procedures through a minimally disruptive approach 
maxcess enables multiple applications designed for each of the following surgical approaches tlif  plif  xlif and decompression  which is removal of tissue soft tissue or bone over the nerve root or disc from under the nerve root to relieve pinching of the nerve 
we believe that maxcess  in combination with neurovision and our specialized implants  will allow more surgeons to use the mas platform to perform procedures which offer important clinical benefits 
this includes the new and innovative lateral procedure  xlif 
the xlif procedure significantly reduces the time of the surgery and also the patient tissue trauma and blood loss  resulting in faster overall patient recovery times 
previously  lateral 
table of contents surgery could only be performed by a handful of very highly skilled surgeons that needed to be accompanied by a general surgeon 
now  with our mas solution  surgeons can successfully avoid critical nerves and access the spine with minimal soft tissue disruption 
we believe maxcess provides the following key benefits compared to other existing minimally invasive surgical systems maximizes access 
the split blade design enables surgeons to customize the surgical exposure to the patient and surgical requirement while maximizing the direct visualization of a patient s anatomy  without additional visualization tools such as endoscopes  cameras  and microscopes 
uses conventional instruments 
maxcess allows surgeons to use instruments similar to those used in open procedures and so requires minimal additional training 
provides benefits of mas with broad application 
maxcess enables surgeons to accomplish a wide range of surgical goals  such as neural decompression  disc height restoration and bony fusion  with mas technology that minimizes operation time and expedites patient recovery and a return to activities of daily living 
mas specialized implants we have a number of implants designed to be used with our mas platform 
these implants are used for interbody disc height restoration for fusion  partial vertebral body replacement and stabilization of the posterior part of the spine 
these implants include spherx and spherx dbr our pedicle screw systems  coroent our family of unique implants for partial vertebral body replacement  allograft precision machined for lumbar tlif and plif application  and extensure an interspinous dynamic stabilization and fusion system that utilizes an allograft implant to maintain decompression through a more natural restoration of the spinal anatomy 
our implants are available in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate the anatomical requirements of the patient and the particular fusion procedure 
our implants are designed for insertion into the smallest possible space while maximizing surface area contact for fusion 
our fixation systems have been uniquely designed to be delivered through our maxcess system to provide stabilization of the posterior spine 
these systems enable minimally disruptive placement of implants and are intended to reduce operating time and patient morbidity 
our implants can also be used in procedures not employing our mas platform 
classic fusion we have developed a suite of traditional spine surgery products  which we refer to as classic fusion  including a line of precision machined cervical and plif allograft implants  a titanium surgical mesh system  and related instrumentation 
allograft implant tissue is recovered from deceased human donors  which is processed into specified sizes and shapes and sterilized for implantation 
unlike other suppliers of allograft implants  our patented packaging process allows us to provide a ready to use structural graft eliminating the need for refrigeration and re hydration 
we package all of our allograft implants in a sterile saline solution 
in addition  our allograft packaging and instrumentation are color coded to assist the surgeon in selecting the proper size implant for use with the appropriate size instrument 
our classic fusion product offerings also include fusion plates such as our smartplate gradient clp  a dynamic cervical plate that encompasses a gradient locking mechanism which gradually loads the screws based upon the anatomic requirements 
this allows the plate to settle in concert with the settling of the allograft implant settling that occurs within the disc space over time  offering a better anatomical fit 

table of contents development projects we are developing proprietary total disc replacement devices for lateral lumbar spine applications and separately for cervical spine applications 
these devices are intended to allow surgeons to address a patient s pain and dysfunction while maintaining normal range of motion and avoiding future adjacent level degeneration that can occur after spine fusion 
we believe that the ability to insert a lumbar total disc replacement device from a lateral approach in a mas procedure will be unique to us  but will require premarket approval rather than k clearance 
we expect the same to be true for our two cervical devices for which we have recently filed for investigational device exemptions 
the first of these is neodisc  a nucleus like cervical disc replacement device designed to preserve motion in the cervical region of the spine and fill the gap between pre surgical treatment and total disc replacement tdr or spinal fusion 
the design has an elastomeric core with a novel embroidered jacket to envelop the core in a similar manner as the annulus with anterior fixation flanges which simulate the anterior longitudinal ligament 
we believe that neodisc could be attractive for use in broad indications and pathologies because of the relatively simple surgical placement procedure and the implant is easily revisable 
the second is cerpass tm  our cervical tdr device  which incorporates a ceramic on ceramic design that we believe will achieve superior long term wear characteristics compared to that of other bearing surfaces 
cerpass also has a self centering feature  designed to ensure proper placement 
research and development our research and development efforts are primarily focused in the near term on developing further enhancements to our existing products  launching as well as developing our total disc product 
our research and development staff consists of people  including four who hold phd degrees and three who hold other advanced degrees 
our research and development group has extensive experience in developing products to treat spine pathology  and continues to work closely with our clinical advisors and spine surgeon customers to design products that are intended to improve patient outcomes  simplify techniques  shorten procedures  reduce hospitalization and rehabilitation times and  as a result  reduce costs 
sales and marketing we currently sell our products through a combination of independent sales agencies and direct sales representatives employed by us 
we historically sold our products through independent sales agencies that were also free to promote the sale of competitive products 
we are in the process of creating a sales force that is entirely exclusive to nuvasive in the sale of spine surgery products 
our efforts will result in a sales force comprised partially of area business managers  or abms  who are nuvasive employees responsible for a defined territory 
the remainder of the sales force will be exclusive independent distributors  each acting as our sole representative in a given territory 
the determination of whether to engage an abm or exclusive distributor is made on a territory by territory basis  with a focus on the candidate who brings the best skills  experience and contacts 
our sales force is managed by a senior vice president of us sales and five divisional sales directors  or dsds 
each dsd is responsible for a portion of the united states and manages the abms and independent distributors engaged in that territory 
we believe the transition to an exclusive sales force is important to our continued growth as this effort will result in a focused sales force with incentives to sell our products across all product lines 
as of february   approximately of our sales force exclusively sells our spine surgery products 
surgeon training and education we devote significant resources to training and educating surgeons on the specialized skills involved in the proper use of our instruments and implants 
we believe that the most effective way to introduce and build market demand for our products is by training spine surgeons in the use of our products 
we maintain a state of the art cadaver operating theatre and training facility at our corporate headquarters to help promote adoption of our products 
in  we trained spine surgeons in the use of our products 
we intend to continue to focus on training both leading and community spine surgeons in the united states 
we believe 
table of contents that a number of these surgeons will become advocates for our products and will be instrumental in generating valuable clinical data and demonstrating the benefits of our products to the medical community 
manufacturing and supply we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our products and their components and servicing  and we do not currently maintain alternative manufacturing sources for neurovision  maxcess or any other finished goods products 
we have identified secondary sources for these products  however  it would take time for these alternative vendors to scale up production 
our outsourcing strategy is targeted at companies that meet fda  international organization for standardization iso  and quality standards supported by internal policies and procedures 
supplier performance is maintained and managed through a corrective action program intended to ensure that all product requirements are met or exceeded 
we believe these manufacturing relationships minimize our capital investment  help control costs  and allow us to compete with larger volume manufacturers of spine surgery products 
following the receipt of products or product components from our third party manufacturers  we conduct inspection and packaging and labeling  as needed  at our headquarters facility 
under our existing contracts  we reserve the exclusive right to inspect and assure conformance of each product and product component to our specifications 
we may consider manufacturing certain products or product components internally  if and when demand or quality requirements make it appropriate to do so 
we currently rely on tissue banks international  inc and us tissue and cell as our only suppliers of allograft implants 
our agreements with each of these suppliers automatically renew for successive one year terms unless otherwise terminated by either party in accordance with the terms of the respective agreement 
because implants are processed from human tissue  maintaining a steady supply is difficult 
in august  we acquired neodisc  an investigational nucleus like cervical disc replacement device  from pearsalls limited 
in connection with that transaction  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with pearsalls  pursuant to which pearsalls will act as the exclusive manufacturer of neodisc  subject to our right to move manufacturing under certain circumstances 
we and our third party manufacturers are subject to the fda s quality system regulations  state regulations  such as the regulations promulgated by the california department of health services  and regulations promulgated by the european union 
for tissue products  we are fda registered and licensed in the states of california  new york and florida  the only states that require licenses 
for our implants and instruments  we are fda registered  california licensed  ce marked and iso certified 
ce is an abbreviation for european compliance 
our facility and the facilities of our third party manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities  and may undergo compliance inspections conducted by the fda and corresponding state agencies 
the fda may impose enforcement  inspections or audits at any time 
loaner equipment we seek to obtain inventory just in time to satisfy our customer obligations to meet surgery schedules 
this strategy minimizes backlogs  while increasing inventory turns and maximizing cash flow 
our pool of mas platform and classic fusion loaner equipment that we loan to or place with hospitals continues to increase as we expand our distribution channels and increase market penetration of our products 
these loaners are important to the growth of our business and we anticipate additional investments in our loaner inventory 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright  trade secret and other intellectual property laws  nondisclosure agreements and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
we believe that in order to have a competitive advantage  we must develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies 
we require our employees  consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements in 
table of contents connection with their employment  consulting or advisory relationships with us 
we also require our employees  consultants and advisors who we expect to work on our products to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the work day  using our property or which relate to our business 
despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
patents as of december  we had issued us patents  foreign national patents  and pending patent applications  including us applications  international pct applications and foreign national applications 
the issued and pending patents cover  among other things targeting systems  mas surgical access and spine systems  implants and related instrumentation  and neurophysiology enabled instrumentation and methodology  including pedicle screw test systems  nerve root retraction systems and surgical access systems 
our issued patents begin to expire in we have multiple patents covering unique aspects and improvements for many of our products 
we do not believe that the expiration of any single patent is likely to significantly affect our intellectual property position 
we have undertaken to protect our neurophysiology platform  including neurovision  through a comprehensive strategy covering various important aspects of our neurophysiology enabled instrumentation  including  screw test  nerve root retraction  surgical access and related methodology 
our neurovision patent portfolio includes issued us patents  issued foreign national patents  us patent applications  including us utility applications  us provisional applications  and us design application  international pct patent applications  and foreign national applications on this system and related instrumentation 
we obtained a us patent with broad claims protecting our spherx pedicle screw system 
in addition to this issued patent  we have several patent applications pending on the spherx pedicle screw system and related instrumentation  including us utility applications  us provisional applications  international pct application  and foreign national applications 
we acquired a substantial intellectual property portfolio as part of our purchase of the neodisc investigational device from pearsalls limited 
this portfolio includes issued us patent  issued foreign national patents  international pct applications  and foreign national applications 
the medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
any claim relating to infringement of patents that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
our success will also depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others  including our competitors and potential competitors 
if our products are found to infringe the patents of others  our development  manufacture and sale of such potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop similar technologies 
because of the importance of our patent portfolio to our business  we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us grows 
while we make an effort to ensure that our products do not infringe other parties patents and proprietary rights  our products and methods may be covered by patents held by our competitors 
in addition  our competitors may assert that future products we may market infringe their patents 

table of contents a patent infringement suit brought against us or any strategic partners or licensees may force us or any strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party s intellectual property  unless that party grants us or any strategic partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property 
in such cases  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products 
however  we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if any strategic partners  licensees or we were able to obtain rights to the third party s intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims  which could severely harm our business 
trademarks as of december   we have trademark registrations  both domestic and foreign  including the following us trademarks nuvasive  neurovision  maxcess  xlif  spherx  coroent  smartplate  creative spine technology  triad  ins  spine evolution nucleus and sen 
we have trademark applications pending  both domestic and foreign  for the following trademarks mas  dbr  neodisc  extensure  cerpass  i pas  instim  absolute responsiveness  nerve avoidance leader  and nuvaplasty 
competition we are aware of a number of major medical device companies that have developed or plan to develop products for minimally invasive spine surgery in each of our current and future product categories 
our currently marketed products are  and any future products we commercialize will be  subject to intense competition 
many of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do  and they may succeed in developing products that would render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  many of these competitors have significantly greater operating history and reputations than we do in their respective fields 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner  receive adequate reimbursement and are safer  less invasive and less expensive than alternatives available for the same purpose 
because of the size of the potential market  we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing competing products 
below are our primary competitors grouped by our product categories 
our neurovision system competes with the conventional nerve monitoring systems offered by nicolet biomedical and axon systems 
we believe our system competes favorably with nicolet s and axon s systems on both price and ease of use for the spine surgeon  with the added advantage that our neurovision system was designed to support surgeon directed applications 
medtronic sofamor danek has also introduced its nim system for nerve monitoring 
the nim system is currently not surgeon directed and requires manual interpretation 
several companies offer products that compete with our maxcess system  spherx pedicle screw system and implants  including competitive offerings by depuy spine  inc  a johnson johnson company  medtronic sofamor danek and stryker spine 
competition is intense in the fusion product market 
we believe that our most significant competitors are medtronic sofamor danek  depuy spine  stryker spine and synthes stratec  inc  each of which has substantially greater sales and financial resources than we do 
medtronic sofamor danek  in particular  has a broad classic fusion product line 
we believe our differentiation in the market is based on packaging the allograft in a saline solution  which allows the product to be used immediately and does not require specialized handling 
we also face competition from a growing number of smaller companies with more limited product offerings and geographic reach than our larger competitors 
these companies  who represent intense competition in specified markets  include abbott spine  inc an abbott laboratories company  blackstone medical  inc  alphatec spine inc  scient x usa  inc  osteotec ltd  and others 

table of contents government regulation our products are medical devices and tissues subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory bodies 
fda regulations govern  among other things  the following activities that we or our partners perform and will continue to perform product design and development  product testing  product manufacturing  product labeling  product storage  premarket clearance or approval  advertising and promotion  and product sales and distribution 
fda s premarket clearance and approval requirements unless an exemption applies  each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the united states will require either prior k clearance or prior premarket approval from the fda 
the fda classifies medical devices into one of three classes 
devices deemed to pose lower risk are placed in either class i or ii  which requires the manufacturer to submit to the fda a premarket notification requesting permission for commercial distribution 
this process is known as k clearance 
some low risk devices are exempt from this requirement 
devices deemed by the fda to pose the greatest risk  such as life sustaining  life supporting or implantable devices  or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared k device are placed in class iii  requiring premarket approval 
both premarket clearance and premarket approval applications are subject to the payment of user fees  paid at the time of submission for fda review 
k clearance pathway to obtain k clearance  we must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared k device or a device that was in commercial distribution before may  for which the fda has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications 
the fda s k clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months from the date the application is completed  but it can take significantly longer 
after a device receives k clearance  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  will require a new k clearance or could require premarket approval 
the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially  but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer s determination 
if the fda disagrees with a manufacturer s determination  the fda can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and or recall the modified device until k clearance or premarket approval is obtained 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance or premarket approval for any modifications to a previously cleared product  we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval 
also  in these circumstances  we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
we have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements that we believe do not require new k clearances 
premarket approval pathway a premarket approval application must be submitted if the device cannot be cleared through the k process 
a premarket approval application must be supported by extensive data including  but not limited to  
table of contents technical  preclinical  clinical trials  manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the fda s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use 
after a premarket approval application is complete  the fda begins an in depth review of the submitted information  which generally takes between one and three years  but may take significantly longer 
during this review period  the fda may request additional information or clarification of information already provided 
also during the review period  an advisory panel of experts from outside the fda may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to the approvability of the device 
in addition  the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with quality system regulations 
new premarket approval applications or premarket approval application supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process  labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process 
premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a premarket approval application  except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application  and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel 
clinical trials a clinical trial is almost always required to support a premarket approval application and is sometimes required for a k premarket notification 
these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption to the fda 
the investigational device exemption application must be supported by appropriate data  such as animal and laboratory testing results  showing that it is safe to evaluate the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound 
the investigational device exemption application must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of subjects  unless the product is deemed a non significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements 
clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the investigational device exemption application is approved by the fda and the responsible institutional review boards 
future clinical trials of our motion preservation designs and interbody implants will likely require that we obtain an investigational device exemption from the fda prior to commencing clinical trials 
in  we filed for investigational device exemptions from the fda with respect to neodisc  our nucleus like cervical disc replacement device  and cerpass  our cervical total disc replacement device 
our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with fda regulations and other federal regulations concerning human subject protection and privacy 
the results of our clinical trials may not be sufficient to obtain approval of our product 
pervasive and continuing fda regulation after a device is placed on the market  numerous regulatory requirements apply 
these include  but are not limited to quality system regulation  which requires manufacturers to follow design  testing  process control  and other quality assurance procedures  labeling regulations  which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off label uses and impose other restrictions on labeling  and medical device reporting regulations  which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the fda  which may include any of the following sanctions fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production  
table of contents refusing our request for k clearance or premarket approval of new products  withdrawing k clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted  and criminal prosecution 
we are subject to unannounced device inspections by the fda and the food and drug branch  as well as other regulatory agencies overseeing the implementation and adherence of applicable state and federal tissue licensing regulations 
these inspections may include our subcontractors facilities 
international international sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations  which vary substantially from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval  and the requirements may differ 
the european union  which consists of of the major countries in europe  has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design  manufacture  clinical trials  labeling  and adverse event reporting for medical devices 
other countries  such as switzerland  have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the european union with respect to medical devices 
devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear ce conformity marking and  accordingly  can be commercially distributed throughout europe 
the method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product  but normally involves a combination of self assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a notified body 
this third party assessment consists of an audit of the manufacturer s quality system and technical review of the manufacturer s product 
in  we successfully passed of initial notified body audit  granting us iso registration and allowing the ce conformity marking to be applied to certain of our devices under the european union medical device directive 
third party reimbursement we expect that sales volumes and prices of our products will continue to be largely dependent on the availability of reimbursement from third party payers  such as governmental programs  for example  medicare and medicaid  private insurance plans and managed care programs 
these third party payers may deny reimbursement if they feel that a device is not the most cost effective treatment available  or was used for an unapproved indication 
also  third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
in international markets  reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific product lines 
there can be no assurance that our products will be considered cost effective by third party payers  that reimbursement will be available or  if available  that the third party payers reimbursement policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
particularly in the united states  third party payers carefully review  and increasingly challenge  the prices charged for procedures and medical products 
in addition  an increasing percentage of insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs  which monitor and often require pre approval of the services that a member will receive 
many managed care programs are paying their providers on a capitated basis  which puts the providers at financial risk for the services provided to their patients by paying them a predetermined payment per member per month 
the percentage of individuals covered by managed care programs is expected to grow in the united states over the next decade 
we believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to  and will continue to lead to  increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services 
there can be no assurance that third party reimbursement and coverage will be available or adequate  or that future legislation  regulation  or reimbursement policies of third party payers will not adversely affect the demand for our products or our ability to sell these products on a profitable basis 
the unavailability or inadequacy of third party payer coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents clinical advisory board we have established a clinical advisory board led by randal betz  md of philadelphia  pennsylvania that we call the spine evolution nucleus  or sen 
this group consists of orthopedic and neurological spine surgeon thought leaders 
the sen consults with us on long term product planning  research  development and marketing initiatives 
significant pioneering clinical developments have been contributed to us by luiz pimenta  md from sao paulo  brazil and other members of the sen

item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below together with all other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report before you decide to invest in our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations and our future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
under these circumstances  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business and industry our failure to build an effective and dedicated distribution network for our products could significantly impair our ability to increase sales of our products 
we have only been selling our products since we currently sell a significant majority of our products in the united states through distribution arrangements with a network of independent agents and sales representatives managed by our sales managers 
as a result  we are dependent upon the sales and marketing efforts of our third party sales agencies 
we pay these agents and sales representatives a commission based on their product sales 
we are currently engaged in significant efforts to convince agents and sales representatives to exclusively sell our spine surgery products 
we believe this is important in increasing our product sales as exclusivity brings greater focus from sales agents and a greater commitment to generate sales of our full product line 
these efforts require us to offer higher commissions  sometimes for extended periods of time 
as a result  these efforts can result in significantly increased expenses and may therefore negatively impact our results of operations 
in addition  if we are unable to convince some of our established third party sales agencies to exclusively sell our spine surgery products  we would have to try to 
table of contents transition this business to exclusive agents 
there is a risk that sales revenue could be lost in connection with such a transition 
our efforts to build a dedicated sales force also include initiatives to hire sales representatives who work directly for us 
we have little experience in establishing a direct sales force  so there is a risk that this sales force will not succeed in growing sales of our products 
although we believe the cost of a direct sales force will be comparable to that of independent agents  there is also a risk that the cost may turn out to be higher 
the establishment and development of a broader and more dedicated distribution network and sales force is expensive and time consuming 
because of the intense competition for their services  we may be unable to identify additional qualified sales representatives and independent sales agencies 
further  we may not be able to enter into agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
even if we do enter into agreements with additional sales representatives and or independent sales agencies  these parties may not be successful in marketing and selling our products 
our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected if the marketing and sales efforts of our direct sales representatives and independent sales agencies are unsuccessful 
pricing pressure from our competitors and sources of medical reimbursement may impact our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to expand our operations and reach profitability 
the market for spine surgery products is large and growing at a significant rate 
this has attracted numerous new companies and technologies  and encouraged more established companies to intensify competitive pressure 
new entrants to our markets include companies owned partially by spine surgeons  who have significant market knowledge and access to the surgeons who use our products 
as a result of this increased competition  we believe there will be growing pricing pressure in the near future 
if competitive forces drive down the price we are able to charge for our products  our profit margins will shrink  which will hamper our ability to invest in and grow our business 
further  successful sales of our products will depend on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third party payors 
healthcare providers  such as hospitals that purchase medical devices for treatment of their patients  generally rely on third party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs and fees associated with the procedures performed with these devices 
spine surgeons are unlikely to use our products if they do not receive reimbursement adequate to cover the cost of their involvement in the surgical procedures 
we also believe that future reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions both in the united states and in international markets 
future legislation  regulation or reimbursement policies of third party payors may adversely affect the demand for our existing products or our products currently under development and limit our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
to the extent we sell our products internationally  market acceptance may depend  in part  upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored healthcare and private insurance 
we are in a highly competitive market segment and face competition from large  well established medical device manufacturers as well as new market entrants 
the market for spine surgery products and procedures is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
with respect to neurovision  our nerve avoidance system  we compete with medtronic sofamor danek  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of medtronic  inc  and nicolet biomedical  a viasys healthcare company  both of which have significantly greater resources than we do 
with respect to maxcess  our minimally disruptive surgical system  our largest competitors are medtronic sofamor danek  inc  depuy spine  inc  a johnson johnson company  and synthes stratec  inc we compete with many of the same companies with respect to our other products 
at any time  these companies may develop alternative treatments  products or procedures for the treatment of spine disorders that compete directly or indirectly with our products 
many of our larger 
table of contents competitors are either publicly traded or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly traded companies  and enjoy several competitive advantages over us  including significantly greater name recognition  established relations with spine surgeons  hospitals  other healthcare providers and third party payors  large and established distribution networks with significant international presence  products supported by long term clinical data  greater experience in obtaining and maintaining united states food and drug administration  or fda  and other regulatory approvals or clearances for products and product enhancements  more expansive portfolios of intellectual property rights  and greater financial and other resources for product research and development  sales and marketing and litigation 
in addition  the spine industry is becoming increasingly crowded with new market entrants  including companies owned at least partially by spine surgeons 
many of these new competitors focus on a specific product or market segment  making it more difficult for us to increase our overall market position 
if these companies become successful  we expect that competition will become even more intense  leading to greater pricing pressure and making it more difficult for us to expand 
to be commercially successful  we must convince spine surgeons that our products are an attractive alternative to existing surgical treatments of spine disorders 
we believe spine surgeons may not widely adopt our products unless they determine  based on experience  clinical data and published peer reviewed journal articles  that our products provide benefits or an attractive alternative to conventional modalities of treating spine disorders 
surgeons may be slow to change their medical treatment practices for the following reasons  among others lack of experience with our products  lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits  perceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures  limited availability of reimbursement within healthcare payment systems  costs associated with the purchase of new products and equipment  and the time that must be dedicated for training 
in addition  we believe recommendations and support of our products by influential surgeons are essential for market acceptance and adoption 
if we do not receive support from such surgeons or have favorable long term data  surgeons and hospitals may not use our products 
in such circumstances  we may not achieve expected revenues and may never become profitable 
our future success depends on our ability to timely develop and introduce new products or product enhancements that will be accepted by the market 
it is important to our business that we continue to build a more complete product offering to surgeons and hospitals 
as such  our success will depend in part on our ability to develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products to keep pace with the rapidly changing spine market 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for or market new products or that any of our future products will be accepted by the surgeons who use our products or the payors who financially 
table of contents support many of the procedures performed with our products 
the success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on several factors  including our ability to properly identify and anticipate surgeon and patient needs  develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner  develop products based on technology that we acquire  such as the technology recently acquired from pearsalls limited  rsb spine llc  and riverbend design llc  avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties  demonstrate  if required  the safety and efficacy of new products with data from preclinical studies and clinical trials  obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements  provide adequate training to potential users of our products  receive adequate reimbursement  and develop an effective and dedicated marketing and distribution network 
if we do not develop new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements  our results of operations will suffer 
we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired products  technologies or businesses  which could adversely affect our business 
we recently acquired assets from each of pearsalls limited  rsb spine llc  and riverbend design llc  and may in the future acquire technology  products or businesses related to our current or future business 
we have limited experience in acquisition activities and may have to devote substantial time and resources in order to complete any future acquisitions 
further  these past and potential acquisitions entail risks  uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business 
for example  we may not be able to successfully integrate an acquired company s operations  technologies  products and services  information systems and personnel into our business 
further  products we acquire  such as the cervical plate we acquired from rsb spine llc and the extensure product acquired from riverbend design llc  may not provide the intended complementary fit with our existing products 
in addition  certain acquired technology  such as that acquired from pearsalls limited  requires significant additional development work and efforts to obtain regulatory clearance or approval 
an acquisition may further strain our existing financial and managerial controls  and divert management s attention away from our other business concerns 
in connection with in process research and development activities  we would likely experience an increase in development expenses and capital expenditures 
there may also be unanticipated costs and liabilities associated with an acquisition that could adversely affect our operating results 
we are dependent on single source suppliers and manufacturers for certain of our products and components  and the loss of any of these suppliers or manufacturers  or their inability to supply us with an adequate supply of materials could harm our business 
we rely on third party suppliers and manufacturers to manufacture and supply our products 
to be successful  our contract manufacturers must be able to provide us with products and components in substantial quantities  in compliance with regulatory requirements  in accordance with agreed upon specifications  at acceptable cost and on a timely basis 
our anticipated growth could strain the ability of suppliers to deliver an increasingly large supply of products  materials and components 
manufacturers often experience difficulties in scaling up production  including problems with production yields and quality control and assurance  especially with products such as allograft which is processed human tissue 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of high quality components to meet customer demand on a timely basis  we could lose customers  our reputation may be harmed and our business could suffer 

table of contents we currently use one or two manufacturers for each of our devices or components 
our dependence on one or two manufacturers involves several risks  including limited control over pricing  availability  quality and delivery schedules 
if any one or more of our manufacturers cease to provide us with sufficient quantities of our components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us  or cease to manufacture components of acceptable quality  we would have to seek alternative sources of manufacturing 
we could incur delays while we locate and engage alternative qualified suppliers and we might be unable to engage alternative suppliers on favorable terms 
any such disruption or increased expenses could harm our commercialization efforts and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue 
further  tissue banks international  inc and us tissue and cell formerly intermountain tissue center collectively supply us with all of our allograft implants  and will continue to be our only sources for the foreseeable future 
the processing of human tissue into allograft implants is very labor intensive and it is therefore difficult to maintain a steady supply stream 
in addition  due to seasonal changes in mortality rates  some scarce tissues used for our allograft implants are at times in particularly short supply 
we cannot be certain that our supply of allograft implants from tissue banks international and us tissue and cell will be available at current levels or will be sufficient to meet our needs 
if we are no longer able to obtain allograft implants from these sources in amounts sufficient to meet our needs  we may not be able to locate and engage replacement sources of allograft implants on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any interruption of our business caused by the need to locate additional sources of allograft implants could significantly harm our revenues  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
additionally  invibio  inc is our exclusive supplier of polyetheretherketone  which comprises our peek partial vertebral body product called coroent 
we have a supply agreement with invibio  pursuant to which we have agreed to purchase our entire supply of polyetheretherketone from invibio 
in addition  we have an exclusive supply arrangement with peak industries  inc  pursuant to which peak industries is our exclusive supplier of neurovision systems 
in the event peak industries ceases to supply us  which it may do at any time  we would be forced to locate a suitable alternative supplier 
we believe the start up time to establish a new supply of neurovision would be approximately to weeks 
we have established an inventory of neurovision systems to help us bridge any downtime in the event peak industries ceases to supply us  however  this inventory may be depleted before we are able to engage an alternate supplier 
any inability to meet our customers demands for neurovision systems could lead to decreased sales and harm our reputation  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
any failure in our efforts to train spine surgeons could significantly reduce the market acceptance of our products 
there is a learning process involved for spine surgeons to become proficient in the use of our products 
it is critical to the success of our commercialization efforts to train a sufficient number of spine surgeons and to provide them with adequate instruction in the use of our products 
this training process may take longer than expected and may therefore affect our ability to increase sales 
convincing surgeons to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training is challenging  and we cannot assure you we will be successful in these efforts 
if surgeons are not properly trained  they may misuse or ineffectively use our products 
this may also result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes  patient injury  negative publicity or lawsuits against us  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business 
although we believe our training methods regarding surgeons are conducted in compliance with fda and other applicable regulations  if the fda determines that our training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use  they could request that we modify our training or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions  including the issuance of a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine and criminal penalty 
we are dependent on the services of alexis v 
lukianov and keith valentine  and the loss of either of them could harm our business 
our continued success depends in part upon the continued service of alexis v 
lukianov  our chairman and chief executive officer  and keith valentine  our president  who are critical to the overall management 
table of contents of nuvasive as well as to the development of our technology  our culture and our strategic direction 
we have entered into employment agreements with messrs 
lukianov and valentine  but neither of these agreements guarantees the service of the individual for a specified period of time 
the loss of either messr 
lukianov or valentine could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have not obtained and do not expect to obtain any key person life insurance policies 
if we fail to properly manage our anticipated growth  our business could suffer 
the rapid growth of our business has placed a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources and systems 
to execute our anticipated growth successfully  we must attract and retain qualified personnel and manage and train them effectively 
we will be dependent on our personnel and third parties to effectively market our products to an increasing number of surgeons 
we will also depend on our personnel to develop next generation technologies 
further  our anticipated growth will place additional strain on our suppliers and manufacturers  resulting in increased need for us to carefully monitor quality assurance 
any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals 
in january  we relocated our operations to a different facility in san diego  california 
although this new facility allows for growth in our business and enables us to more effectively train surgeons in the use of our products  it has significantly increased our operating expenses 
for example  our monthly lease payments approximately doubled and we also pay increased maintenance costs for this facility 
if we do not generate additional business opportunities  these additional expenses could negatively affect our results of operations 
if we fail to obtain  or experience significant delays in obtaining  fda clearances or approvals for our future products or product enhancements  our ability to commercially distribute and market our products could suffer 
our medical devices are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda and numerous other federal  state and foreign governmental authorities 
the process of obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals to market a medical device  particularly from the fda  can be costly and time consuming  and there can be no assurance that such clearances or approvals will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
in particular  the fda permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received clearance under section k of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or is the subject of an approved premarket approval application  or pma 
the fda will clear marketing of a medical device through the k process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other k cleared products 
the pma process is more costly  lengthy and uncertain than the k clearance process 
a pma application must be supported by extensive data  including  but not limited to  technical  preclinical  clinical trial  manufacturing and labeling data  to demonstrate to the fda s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use 
our failure to comply with such regulations could lead to the imposition of injunctions  suspensions or loss of regulatory approvals  product recalls  termination of distribution  or product seizures 
in the most egregious cases  criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible 
to date  all of our products  unless exempt  have been cleared through the k process 
we have no experience in obtaining premarket approval 
we expect that our total disc replacement devices currently under development  including cerpass  our investigational cervical total disc replacement device  and neodisc  our investigational nucleus like cervical disc replacement device  will have to go through the pma process 
these devices have not yet reached the clinical trial stage and we cannot assure you whether successful clinical trials will be conducted or completed or regulatory approval will ultimately be obtained for these devices 
moreover  clinical trials typically have durations of several years and competing products may be introduced while our devices are undergoing clinical trials 
this could reduce the potential demand for our products and negatively 
table of contents impact our business prospects 
our competitors new products and technologies may be more effective or less expensive than our products or render our products obsolete 
further  pursuant to fda regulations  we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses 
certain of our products may be used by physicians for indications other than those cleared or approved by the fda  but we cannot promote the products for such off label uses 
if the fda determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use  it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions  including the issuance of a warning letter  injunction  seizure  civil fine and criminal penalties 
it is also possible that other federal  state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use  which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities 
foreign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and  to the extent we market and sell our products in foreign countries  we may be subject to rigorous regulation in the future 
in such circumstances  we would rely significantly on our foreign independent sales agencies to comply with the varying regulations  and any failures on their part could result in restrictions on the sale of our products in foreign countries 
the safety of our products is not yet supported by long term clinical data and may therefore prove to be less safe and effective than initially thought 
we obtained clearance to offer almost all of our products that require fda clearance or approval through the fda s k clearance process 
the fda s k clearance process is less rigorous than the pma process and requires less supporting clinical data 
as a result  we currently lack the breadth of published long term clinical data supporting the safety of our products and the benefits they offer that might have been generated in connection with the pma process 
for these reasons  spine surgeons may be slow to adopt our products  we may not have comparative data that our competitors have or are generating and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks 
further  future patient studies or clinical experience may indicate that treatment with our products does not improve patient outcomes 
such results would reduce demand for our products  significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected revenues and could prevent us from becoming profitable 
moreover  if future results and experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects  we could be subject to significant legal liability and harm to our business reputation 
the spine medical device market has been particularly prone to costly product liability litigation 
if we or our suppliers fail to comply with the fda s quality system regulations  the manufacture of our products could be delayed 
we and our suppliers are required to comply with the fda s quality system regulations  which cover the methods and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging  storage and shipping of our products 
the fda enforces the quality system regulation through inspections 
if we or one of our suppliers fail a quality system regulations inspection or if any corrective action plan is not sufficient  the manufacture of our products could be delayed 
we underwent an fda inspection in august regarding our allograft implant business  and another fda inspection in april regarding our medical device activities 
in connection with these inspections  the fda requested minor corrective actions  which we believe we have taken  but there can be no assurance the fda will not subject us to further enforcement action 
the fda may impose additional inspections or audits at any time 
modifications to our marketed products may require new k clearances or premarket approvals  or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances are obtained 
any modification to a k cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or efficacy  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance or  possibly  premarket approval 
the fda requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda 
table of contents may review any manufacturer s decision 
the fda may not agree with any of our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance or premarket approval for any modification to a previously cleared product  we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval  and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
further  our products could be subject to recall if the fda determines  for any reason  that our products are not safe or effective 
any recall or fda requirement that we seek additional approvals or clearances could result in delays  fines  costs associated with modification of a product  loss of revenue and potential operating restrictions imposed by the fda 
risks related to our financial results and need for financing we have a limited operating history  have incurred significant operating losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses  and we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability 
we were incorporated in delaware in  and have since focused primarily on research and development and on seeking regulatory clearances to market our products 
we began commercial sales in and have several product offerings in both mas and classic fusion 
we have yet to demonstrate that we can generate sufficient sales of our products to become profitable 
the extent of our future operating losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain  and we may never achieve profitability 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
it is possible that we will never generate sufficient revenues from product sales to achieve profitability 
even if we do achieve significant revenues from our product sales  we expect that increased operating expenses will result in significant operating losses in the near term as we  among other things pay the acquisition costs ie  purchase price and related expenses and continued development and regulatory costs related to our recent acquisition of assets and technology from each of rsb spine llc and pearsalls limited  especially with respect to the significant ongoing development and regulatory expenses associated with the assets acquired from pearsalls limited  grow our internal and third party sales and marketing forces to expand the penetration of our products in the united states  and expend significant sums in connection with our efforts to convince independent agents and sales representatives to exclusively sell our spine surgery products  increase our research and development efforts to improve upon our existing products and develop new product candidates  such as the potential products resulting from the assets acquired from pearsalls limited  and perform clinical research and trials on our existing products and product candidates 
as a result of these activities  we may never become profitable 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on an ongoing basis 
in addition  our independent distributors are entitled to certain payments in the event their services are terminated in connection with or shortly following a change of control of our company 
these payments are the responsibility of our successor  but may represent an additional significant expense or reduce the price paid in connection with any such event 
our quarterly financial results are likely to fluctuate significantly because our sales prospects are uncertain 
our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period  particularly because our sales prospects are uncertain 
these fluctuations will also affect our annual operating results and may cause those results to fluctuate unexpectedly from year to year 
the level of our revenues and results of operations at any given time will be based primarily on the following factors our ability to drive increased sales of our products to hospitals and surgeons  our ability to establish and maintain an effective and dedicated sales force  pricing pressure applicable to our products  including adverse third party reimbursement outcomes  
table of contents results of clinical research and trials on our existing products and products in development and our ability to obtain fda approval or clearance  the mix of our products sold ie  profit margins differ between our products  timing of new product offerings  acquisitions  licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors  the ability of our suppliers to timely provide us with an adequate supply of materials and components  the evolving product offerings of our competitors and the potential introduction of new and competing technologies  regulatory approvals and legislative changes affecting the products we may offer or those of our competitors  and interruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products 
many of the products we may seek to develop and introduce in the future will require fda approval or clearance  without which we cannot begin to commercialize them in the united states  and commercialization of them outside of the united states would likely require other regulatory approvals and import licenses 
as a result  it will be difficult for us to forecast demand for these products with any degree of certainty 
in addition  we will be increasing our operating expenses as we build our commercial capabilities 
accordingly  we may experience significant  unanticipated quarterly losses 
because of these factors  our operating results in one or more future quarters may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
risks related to our intellectual property and potential litigation our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  and nondisclosure  confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
for example  our pending us and foreign patent applications may not issue as patents in a form that will be advantageous to us or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others and invalidated 
in addition  our pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our products and procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents 
both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive 
competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products which provide outcomes which are comparable to ours 
although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology  including entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our officers  employees  consultants and advisors  such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
in the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights  enforcing those rights may be costly  difficult and time consuming 
even if successful  litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time consuming and could divert our management s attention 
we may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge 
in addition  certain product categories  including pedicle screws  have been the subject of significant litigation in recent years 
since we sell pedicle screws and recently introduced our spherx pedicle screw system  any related litigation could harm our business 

table of contents the medical device industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
patent litigation can involve complex factual and legal questions and its outcome is uncertain 
any claim relating to infringement of patents that is successfully asserted against us may require us to pay substantial damages 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
our success will also depend in part on our not infringing patents issued to others  including our competitors and potential competitors 
if our products are found to infringe the patents of others  our development  manufacture and sale of such potential products could be severely restricted or prohibited 
in addition  our competitors may independently develop similar technologies 
because of the importance of our patent portfolio to our business  we may lose market share to our competitors if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights 
as the number of entrants into our market increases  the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us grows 
while we make an effort to ensure that our products do not infringe other parties patents and proprietary rights  our products and methods may be covered by patents held by our competitors 
in addition  our competitors may assert that future products we may market infringe their patents 
a patent infringement suit brought against us or any strategic partners or licensees may force us or any strategic partners or licensees to stop or delay developing  manufacturing or selling potential products that are claimed to infringe a third party s intellectual property  unless that party grants us or any strategic partners or licensees rights to use its intellectual property 
in such cases  we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others in order to continue to commercialize our products 
however  we may not be able to obtain any licenses required under any patents or proprietary rights of third parties on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if any strategic partners  licensees or we were able to obtain rights to the third party s intellectual property  these rights may be non exclusive  thereby giving our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we may be unable to commercialize some of our potential products or may have to cease some of our business operations as a result of patent infringement claims  which could severely harm our business 
we are subject to litigation regarding cadavers we purchased that originated from the university of california at los angeles 
for a period of time  we purchased cadavers for surgeon training purposes from a broker who is now being investigated for his practices in obtaining those cadavers from the university of california  los angeles  or ucla 
we previously received inquiries and document requests from the fda and the state of california regarding this investigation 
although we have been informed that we are not a subject of this investigation  we have been named as a defendant  along with the regents of the university of california  the david geffen school of medicine at ucla  ernest v 
nelson  henry g 
reid  and johnson johnson  in multiple civil class action lawsuits relating to the underlying events 
the lawsuits have been consolidated in a single court in the superior court of the state of california  county of los angeles 
the lawsuits generally allege fraud  negligence and unfair business practices in connection with the use and distribution of the donated cadavers  and further allege that the cadavers were improperly sold 
these lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and could be a diversion of management s time and other resources 
if the claims contained in the lawsuit are successfully asserted against us  our financial performance and cash position could be negatively impacted and the market price of our shares may decline 
if we become subject to product liability claims  we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing  manufacture and sale of medical devices for spine surgery procedures 
spine surgery involves significant risk of serious complications  including bleeding  nerve injury  paralysis and even death 
in addition  we sell allograft implants  derived from cadaver bones  which pose the potential risk of biological contamination 
if any such contamination is found to exist  sales of allograft products could decline 

table of contents currently  we maintain product liability insurance in the amount of million 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  if our product liability insurance proves to be inadequate to pay a damage award  we may have to pay the excess out of our cash reserves  if such reserves are not sufficient  which may harm our financial condition 
if longer term patient results and experience indicate that our products or any component cause tissue damage  motor impairment or other adverse effects  we could be subject to significant liability 
finally  even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could harm our reputation in the industry  lead to significant legal fees and could result in the diversion of management s attention from managing our business 
any claims relating to our making improper payments to physicians for consulting services  or other potential violations of regulations governing interactions between us and healthcare providers  could be time consuming and costly 
we frequently engage spine surgeons as consultants to assist us with scientific research and development and to help us evaluate technologies 
we are subject to federal and state laws and regulations governing our relationships with physicians and other health care providers 
in april  the united states department of justice expanded its investigation into the relationships between medical device companies and health care providers 
the investigation originally appeared to focus on medtronic sofamor danek  inc  but the department of justice has apparently since issued subpoenas to depuy spine  inc  a johnson johnson company  biomet  smith nephew  stryker and zimmer holdings  all orthopedic device manufacturers  relating to the consulting process and procedures tied to fees that such companies have paid to physicians as consultants 
although we have not been contacted by the department of justice in respect of this investigation  we could become a subject of the investigation and be forced to incur significant costs as a result 
the regulations governing the interactions between medical device companies and health care providers continue to evolve 
compliance with these regulations is costly  especially as accepted methods of compliance are developed 
we expect to continue to incur costs related to compliance with these new measures  such as the requirement to comply with the new california prescription drug marketing act 
we or our suppliers may be the subject of claims for non compliance with fda regulations in connection with the processing or distribution of allograft implants 
it is possible that allegations may be made against us or against donor recovery groups or tissue banks  including those with which we have a contractual relationship  claiming that the acquisition or processing of tissue for allograft implants does not comply with applicable fda regulations or other relevant statutes and regulations 
allegations like these could cause regulators or other authorities to take investigative or other action against us  or could cause negative publicity for us or our industry generally 
these actions or any negative publicity could cause us to incur substantial costs  divert the attention of our management from our business  harm our reputation and cause the market price of our shares to decline 
risks related to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock we expect that the price of our common stock will fluctuate substantially  potentially adversely affecting the ability of investors to sell their shares 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to many factors  including volume and timing of orders for our products  the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  disputes or other developments with respect to intellectual property rights or other potential legal actions  
table of contents our ability to develop  obtain regulatory clearance or approval for  and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis  quarterly variations in our or our competitor s results of operations  sales of large blocks of our common stock  including sales by our executive officers and directors  announcements of technological or medical innovations for the treatment of spine pathology  changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals  clearances or applications  changes in the availability of third party reimbursement in the united states or other countries  the acquisition or divestiture of products  assets or technology  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
market price fluctuations may negatively affect the ability of investors to sell our shares at consistent prices 
recent changes in the required accounting treatment for stock options will have a material negative impact on our financial statements and may affect our stock price 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
r  pursuant to which we must measure all stock based compensation awards  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
currently  we disclose such expenses on a pro forma basis in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  but we do not record a charge for employee stock option expense in the financial statements 
we began complying with sfas no 
r as of january   as a result our reported earnings will decrease  which may affect our stock price 
we may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management s attention and harm our business 
the stock market in general  the nasdaq national market and the market for medical device companies in particular  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
further  the market prices of securities of medical device companies have been particularly volatile 
these broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future 
litigation often is expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations 
anti takeover provisions in our organizational documents and delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control  even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders  which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable 
some of these provisions authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval  with rights senior to those of the common stock  
table of contents provide for a classified board of directors  with each director serving a staggered three year term  prohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies  calling special stockholder meetings  or taking action by written consent  prohibit our stockholders from making certain changes to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws except with stockholder approval  and require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations 
in addition  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock 
these and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then current board of directors  including delay or impede a merger  tender offer  or proxy contest involving our company 
any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock 
we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the terms of any future debt or credit facility may preclude us from paying any dividends

overview background 
we are a medical device company focused on the design  development and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders 
our product portfolio is focused on applications for lumbar and cervical spine fusion  as well as dynamic stablization 
our principal product offering includes a minimally disruptive surgical platform called maximum access surgery  or mas  as well as classic fusion implants comprised of bone allografts in our patented saline packaging and internal fixation products 
our products are used predominantly in spine fusion surgeries  both to enable access to the spine and to perform restorative and fusion procedures 
as of december   we have trained surgeons in the use of our products 
since inception  we have been unprofitable 
we incurred net losses of approximately million in  million in and million in as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 

table of contents revenues 
from inception to december   we have recognized million in revenue from sales of our products 
our revenues are derived from the sale of medical products in two principal classifications mas 
our mas platform combines three categories of our product offerings neurovision a proprietary software driven nerve avoidance system  maxcess a unique split blade design retraction system providing enhanced surgical access to the spine  and specialized implants  like our spherx pedicle screw system  coroent suite of products and new extensure dynamic stabilization and fusion system 
classic fusion 
our classic fusion revenues primarily consist of the sales of bone allograft  metal cage implants and fusion plates 
the majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of disposables and implants and we expect this trend to continue in the near term 
to date  we have derived less than of our total revenues from the sale of mas instrument sets  maxcess devices  and neurovision systems 
we do not expect these sales to contribute significantly to our revenues in the future because we intend to continue to i loan neurovision  maxcess and surgical instrument sets to hospitals and surgeons who purchase our disposables and implants for use in individual procedures or ii place neurovision  maxcess and surgical instrument sets with hospitals for an extended period at no up front cost to them provided they commit to minimum monthly purchases of our disposables and implants 
in the event a hospital or surgeon does not meet its minimum monthly purchase commitments  our sole remedy is to remove our products 
our implants and disposables are sold and shipped from our facility or from limited disposable inventories stored at our distributors sites 
we invoice hospitals a fee for using certain instruments and for any disposables or implants upon receiving notice of product use or implantation 
for neurovision  we generally place the system in hospitals free of charge and allow it to remain on site provided the hospital orders a minimum monthly quantity of our nerve avoidance disposable products 
in addition  we have a program pursuant to which we loan  from a pool of fixed assets  neurovision  maxcess and surgical instrument sets to hospitals without charge to support individual surgical procedures 
sales and marketing 
substantially all of our operations are located in the united states and substantially all of our sales to date have been generated in the united states 
we distribute our products through a sales force comprised of independent agencies and our own sales personnel 
our sales force provides a delivery and consultative service to our surgeon and hospital customers and receive commissions based on sales and product placements in their territories 
the commissions are reflected in our statement of operations in the selling and marketing expense line 
we expect to continue to expand our distribution channel 
since the second quarter of  we have been engaged in a process to create a sales force of independent distributors and our own employees that is exclusive to us with respect to the sale of spine products 
these efforts are ongoing and we expect to incur increased sales and marketing expenses as we hire additional sales personnel and incentivize new and existing representatives to exclusively sell our products 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to bad debts  inventories  long term assets and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which sets forth guidelines for the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  installation  payment and customer acceptance 
we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
specifically  revenue from the sale of implants and disposables is recognized upon receipt of written acknowledgement that the product has been used in a surgical procedure or upon shipment to third party customers who immediately accept title 
revenue from the sale of neurovision units and instrument sets is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and the subsequent shipment to customers who immediately accept title 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and is estimated based on the aging of account balances  collection history and known trends with current customers 
as a result of this review  the allowance is adjusted on a specific identification basis 
increases to the allowance for doubtful accounts result in a corresponding expense 
we maintain a relatively large customer base that mitigates the risk of concentration with one customer 
however  if the overall condition of the healthcare industry were to deteriorate  or if the historical data used to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  resulting in an impairment of our customers ability to make payments  significant additional allowances could be required 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence and excess inventory based upon historical turnover and assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
our allograft implants have a four year shelf life and are subject to demand fluctuations based on the availability and demand for alternative implant products 
our mas inventory  which consists primarily of instruments  disposables and specialized implants  is at risk of obsolescence following the introduction and development of new or enhanced products 
our estimates and assumptions for excess and obsolete inventory are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
future product introductions and related inventories may require additional reserves based upon changes in market demand or introduction of competing technologies 
increases in the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory result in a corresponding expense to cost of goods sold 
long term assets 
property  plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of two to seven years for machinery and equipment and three years for loaner equipment 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology and are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of years  the life of the related patents 
we evaluate our long term assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the long term asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the long term asset is not recoverable  we reduce the net carrying value of the related asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining depreciation or amortization period 
we have not recognized any impairment losses on long term assets through december  accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of december  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future

consistent with our strategy  we expect our mas products will continue to be a significant contributor to our total revenue for the foreseeable future 
classic fusion revenues increased in due primarily to increased sales of lumbar allograft and our cervical plate  smartplate gradient clp 
the decreases as a percent of total revenue are due primarily to new product introductions in the mas category

the increase in cost of goods sold in total dollars in each year presented is due primarily to increased product sales  specifically the related material costs 
in addition  in the second quarter of  we recorded an additional charge to cost of goods sold for the write off in connection with the acquisition of assets from rsb spine llc of approximately  related to our own cervical plate under development 
increases and decreases in cost of goods sold as a percentage of total revenues in each year presented are due primarily to a shift in product mix to mas products which have a higher margin than our classic fusion products  offset by the additional charge noted above 
our overall cost of goods sold and gross profit are subject to fluctuation based on the mix between mas and classic fusion products 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
years ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands of total revenue sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee and distributor commissions and personnel costs related to sales  marketing and customer support  along with tradeshow and surgeon training expenses 
in the second quarter of  we began a program to transition our sales force toward exclusivity which has resulted in higher commissions as a percent of revenue for the year 
we expect this trend to continue 
the year over year increases in sales and marketing expenses in and resulted primarily from i increased commissions of million and million in and  respectively  reflecting the increased sales volume and  to a lesser extent  the higher commission rate in the second half of  ii increased royalties of  and  in and  respectively  reflecting the increased sales volume  iii additional employee related and consulting costs of million and million in and  respectively  iv increased promotional materials costs of  and  in and  respectively  and v increased shipping costs of million and  in and  respectively  each of which is attributable to increases in sales and the number of sales representatives  and vi increased expenses related to surgeon training of million and  in and  respectively  reflecting the increase in number of surgeons trained in each year 
we expect to increase our expenditures on sales and marketing for the foreseeable future 
these increased amounts will be directed towards hiring direct sales agents and additional sales management training personnel  expanding and training our distribution channels  promoting awareness of our products and providing training to surgeons 
these amounts will also be used to compensate our sales force  including both independent and direct sales agents  and to continue our transition to an exclusive sales force

table of contents stock based compensation through december  and as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  we elected to use the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  to measure compensation expense for stock based awards to employees 
accordingly  we generally recognized no compensation expense with respect to stock based awards to employees and directors as awards are generally issued with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the common stock on the grant date 
under apb  if the exercise price of our employee and director stock options is less than the estimated fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  we record deferred compensation for the difference 
prior to our initial public offering completed on may   we established the exercise price based on the fair value of our stock at the date of grant as determined by our board of directors 
in determining the fair value of the common stock  the board of directors considered i the advancement of our technology  ii our financial position and iii the fair value of our preferred stock as determined in arm s length transactions 
with respect to certain options granted during and  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of  and  respectively  for the incremental difference at the grant date between the fair value per share determined by the board of directors and the deemed fair value per share determined solely for financial reporting purposes in conjunction with our initial public offering

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services through share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the cost of such instruments will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
the adoption of sfas r will have a significant adverse impact on our earnings  however  it will not impact our cash flows

in process research and development we recorded an in process research and development iprd charge of million related to our acquisition of the technology assets of pearsalls limited in the third quarter of at the date of the acquisition  the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  the amounts were charged to expense on the acquisition date 
valuation of iprd 
the value assigned to acquired in process technology is determined by identifying products under research in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established 
the value of the in process technology was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach  focusing on the income producing capabilities of the in process technologies 
under this approach  the value is determined by estimating the revenue contribution generated by each of the identified technologies 
revenue estimates were based on i individual product revenues  ii anticipated growth rates  iii anticipated product development and introduction schedules  iv product sales cycles  and v the estimated life of a product s underlying technology 
from the revenue estimates  operating expense estimates  including costs of sales  general and administrative  selling and marketing  and income taxes  were deducted to arrive at operating income 
revenue growth rates were estimated by management for the product and gave consideration to relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected industry trends  the anticipated nature and timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of the product s underlying technology 
operating expense estimates reflect nuvasive s historical expense ratios 
additionally  these projects will require continued research and development after they have reached a state of technological and commercial feasibility 
the resulting operating income stream was discounted to reflect its present value at the date of acquisition 
the rate used to discount the net cash flows from purchased in process technology is our weighted average cost of capital wacc  taking into account our required rates of return from investments in various areas of the enterprise and reflecting the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the acquired in process technology  the useful life of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  if any  and the uncertainty of technological advances  all of which are unknown at this time
