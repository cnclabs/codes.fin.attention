membership fees increased to billion  or of net sales  in fiscal from billion  or of net sales  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to additional membership sign ups at the new warehouses opened in fiscal  increased penetration of the executive membership program  and high overall member renewal rates consistent with recent years  currently 
in april  we announced plans to increase annual membership fees by for our us and canada gold star individual  business  and business add on members  effective may  for new members and july  for renewals 
approximately million members will be affected by this increase 
membership fees are accounted for on a deferred basis  whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over the one year term of the membership  which will have the effect of spreading the full realization of the increase over the next two fiscal years

gross margin was billion in fiscal or of net sales  compared to billion or of net sales in fiscal this eleven basis point decrease reflected increased penetration of the executive membership two percent reward program and increased spending by executive members  which decreased gross margin by ten basis points 
additionally  a decrease of four basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments and warehouse ancillary businesses was primarily due to changes in the sales mix  with higher sales penetration of lower margin departments and slightly lower overall gross margins in our hardlines and softlines categories 
these decreases were partially offset by a three basis point improvement due to the absence of a charge to inventories following the last in  first out lifo method 
vs 
gross margin increased to billion  or of net sales  in fiscal from billion  or of net sales in fiscal this seven basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of net sales reflected a decrease of three basis points in gross margin in our merchandise departments 
the three basis point decrease in merchandising is largely due to changes in the sales mix  with higher penetration of lower margin departments 
this effect was offset by gross margin gains in most of our merchandise departments  as well as our international operations 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales was positively impacted by five basis points due to the implementation of eitf  whereby net sales and merchandise costs were reduced equally 
the gross margin percentage was reduced by ten basis points due to the increased penetration of the executive member two percent reward program  increased spending by executive members and the resulting increases in the related costs 
the gross margin figures reflect accounting for most us merchandise inventories on the lifo method 
fiscal included a million lifo charge increase in merchandise costs  while fiscal included a million lifo charge 
the impact of the lifo adjustment on a year over year basis negatively impacted gross margin  as a percentage of sales  by one additional basis point

the decrease in interest expense in fiscal resulted primarily from the repayment of the 
senior notes in june in addition  interest expense decreased on the 
zero coupon notes as note holders converted approximately million in principal amount of the notes into common stock 
the amount of interest capitalized increased in fiscal  contributing to the decrease in interest expense  as both interest rates and the dollar amount of projects under construction increased

the low rate in fiscal was primarily attributable to a non recurring million income tax benefit resulting primarily from the settlement of a transfer pricing dispute between the united states and canada covering the years and a net tax benefit on excess foreign tax credits on unremitted foreign earnings of million

of these balances  approximately million and million at september  and august   respectively  represented debit and credit card receivables  primarily related to weekend sales immediately prior to the year end close 
the decrease in our most liquid assets of million to billion at september  was due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock  the acquisition of property and equipment related to warehouse expansion and the payment of cash dividends

this increase is attributable to higher net income and an increase in cash flow from operating assets and liabilities of million  offset by an increase in net merchandise inventories merchandise inventory less accounts payable of million

expansion plans our primary requirement for capital is the domestic and international financing of the land  building and equipment costs for new and remodeled warehouses plus the costs of initial warehouse operations and working capital requirements 
while there can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized  and plans are subject to change upon further review  it is management s current intention to spend approximately billion to billion during fiscal for real estate  construction  remodeling and equipment for warehouse clubs and related operations 
these expenditures are expected to be financed with a combination of cash provided from operations and the use of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
plans for the united states and canada during fiscal are to open approximately to new warehouses on a net basis  inclusive of one to two relocations

during fiscal  million in principal amount of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes were converted by note holders into million shares of common stock 
the current notes outstanding are convertible into a maximum of  shares of costco common stock at an initial conversion price of 
derivatives we have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and use them only to manage well defined interest rate and foreign exchange risks 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on inventory purchases and typically have very short terms 
the aggregate notional amount  which approximates the fair value of foreign exchange contracts outstanding at september  and august   was million and million  respectively 
the majority of the forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into by our wholly owned united kingdom subsidiary  primarily to hedge us dollar merchandise inventory purchases 
we also hold interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings and the mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
as of september  and august   we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million and an aggregate fair value of million and million  respectively 
these amounts were recorded in deferred income taxes and other current assets as of september  and in other assets as of 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued august   in our consolidated balance sheets 
these swaps were entered into effective march   and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of our million senior notes 
as the terms of the swaps match those of the underlying hedged debt  the changes in the fair value of these swaps are offset by corresponding changes in the carrying amount of the hedged debt and result in no net earnings impact 
we are exposed to market risk for changes in utility commodity pricing  which we partially mitigate through the use of firm price contracts with counterparties for approximately of our locations in the us and canada 
the effects of these arrangements are not significant for any period presented 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of our operating leases  we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition or consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the financial position and results of operations 
management continues to review its accounting policies and evaluate its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  merchandise inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  warehouse closing costs  insurance self insurance liabilities  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
revenue recognition we recognize sales  net of estimated returns  at the time customers take possession of merchandise or receive services 
when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued merchandise or the performance of services  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the sale or service is completed 
we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical returns levels 
we evaluate the criteria of the financial accounting standards board fasb emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions 
generally  when we are the primary obligor  subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  influence product or service specifications  or have several but not all of these indicators  revenue is recorded on a gross basis 
if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above  we record the net amounts as commissions earned  which is reflected in net sales 
membership fee revenue represents annual membership fees paid by substantially all of our members 
we account for membership fee revenue on a deferred basis  whereby membership fee revenue is recognized ratably over one year 
our executive members qualify for a reward which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses  up to a maximum of per year  on all qualified purchases made at costco 
we account for this reward as a reduction in sales  with the related liability being classified within other current liabilities 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  as determined primarily by the retail method of accounting  and are stated using the last in  first out lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail method of accounting and are stated using the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues 
we record an adjustment each quarter  if necessary  for the expected annual effect of inflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end 
at both september  and august  merchandise inventories valued at lifo approximated fifo after considering the lower of cost or market principle 
we provide for estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales 
the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect the actual physical inventory count results  which generally occur in the second and fourth fiscal quarters of the fiscal year 
inventory cost  where appropriate  is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates  provided they are probable and reasonably estimable 
other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones  terms of agreement  or other systematic and rational approach 
impairment of long lived assets and warehouse closing costs we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment 
our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist  requiring an adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 
we provide estimates for warehouse closing costs based on applicable us generally accepted accounting principles 
future circumstances may result in actual closing costs or the amount recognized upon the sale of the property to differ substantially from the original estimates 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued insurance self insurance liabilities we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool  to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property damage  director and officers liability  vehicle liability and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience and evaluations of outside expertise  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term volatility  and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we ceased the granting of stock options in favor of restricted stock units 
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
significant judgment is required in assessing  among other things  the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions may be successfully challenged 
when facts and circumstances change  we adjust these reserves through our provision for income taxes 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements sab 
sab addresses how the effects of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires an entity to quantify misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
we early adopted sab as of august   the beginning of our fiscal year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective beginning in fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the eitf reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure 
eitf is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december  amounts collected from our members  which under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes  are and have been recorded on a net basis 
we have no intention of modifying this accounting policy 
therefore  the adoption of eitf will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of accounting principles board opinion no 
 and fasb statement no 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle  such as a change in non discretionary profit sharing payments resulting from an accounting change  should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt the provisions of sfas beginning in fiscal we do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our future consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates 
as a policy  we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the nature and amount of our long and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of september   our fixed rate long term debt included million principal amount at maturity zero coupon subordinated notes carried at million and additional notes and capital lease obligations totaling million 
our debt also includes million senior notes carried at million 
we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps on the senior notes  effectively converting these fixed interest rate securities to variable rate securities 
as of september  and august   we had fixed to floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million and an aggregate fair value of million and million  respectively 
fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt 
we hold interest bearing instruments that are classified as cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
our investment policy is to manage our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances to preserve principal and liquidity  while seeking to maximize the return on our investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities and through a combination of internal and third party investment management 
short term investments generally have a maturity of three months to five years from the purchase date
