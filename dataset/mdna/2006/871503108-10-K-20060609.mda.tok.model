for further discussion of our acquisitions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
competition our markets are highly competitive and are subject to rapid changes in technology 
our competitiveness depends on our ability to deliver products that meet our customers needs by enhancing our existing solutions and services and offering reliable  scalable  and standardized new solutions on a timely basis 
we believe that the principal competitive factors necessary to be successful in our industry also include quality  integration of advanced technology  time to market  price  reputation  financial stability  breadth of product offerings  customer support  brand recognition  and effective sales and marketing efforts 
in addition to the competition we face from direct competitors  we face indirect or potential competition from operating system providers and network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers  who may provide various solutions and functions in their current and future products 
we also compete for access to 
table of contents retail distribution channels and for the attention of customers at the retail level and in corporate accounts 
in addition  we compete with other software companies  operating system providers  and network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers to acquire products or companies and to publish software developed by third parties 
the competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below consumer products some of the channels in which our consumer products are offered are highly competitive 
our competitors are sometimes intensely focused on customer acquisition  which has led such competitors to offer their technology for free  engage in aggressive marketing  or enter into competitive partnerships 
during fiscal  pricing for subscriptions increased  while pricing in retail and online stores remained consistent or decreased 
our primary competitors in the consumer products segment are microsoft corporation  mcafee  inc  and trend micro  incorporated 
during fiscal  microsoft launched the beta version of a security suite that will compete with our consumer products 
this security suite includes anti spyware and antivirus features  and a backup utility 
in addition  microsoft has recently added security features to new versions of its operating system products that provide some of the same functions offered in our products 
enterprise security in the enterprise security markets  we compete against many companies that offer competing products to our technology solutions and competing services to our response and support services 
our primary competitors in enterprise security are mcafee  trend micro  ca  inc  internet security systems  inc  and cisco systems  inc 
in the managed security services segment  our primary competitors are verisign  inc and international business machines corporation  or ibm 
recent acquisitions by microsoft are indicators of its move into the enterprise security market and could lead to the inclusion of antivirus and antispyware functionality in future versions of its operating system products or to its release of stand alone enterprise products 
with core antivirus being a required solution for enterprises of all sizes  we believe that product differentiation is essential for us to maintain our leadership position 
we are focused on integrating next generation technology capabilities into our solution set in order to differentiate ourselves from the competition 
data protection the market for data protection products is characterized by ongoing technological innovation 
many of our strategic partners offer software products that compete with our products or have announced their intention to focus on developing or acquiring their own backup  archive  and data restoration software products 
our primary competitors in the data protection segment are ibm  ca  and emc corporation 
storage and server management the markets for storage and server management are intensely competitive 
in the areas of storage management solutions  application and server management  remote management  imaging provisioning  and asset management  our primary competitors are emc  sun microsystems  inc  hewlett packard company  ibm  oracle corporation  and microsoft 
services we believe that the principal competitive factors for our services segment include technical capability  customer responsiveness  and our ability to hire and retain talented and experienced services personnel 
our primary competitors in the services segment are ibm  electronic data systems corporation  and emc 

table of contents intellectual property protective measures we regard some of the features of our internal operations  software  and documentation as proprietary and rely on copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures  contractual arrangements  and other measures to protect our proprietary information 
our intellectual property is an important and valuable asset that enables us to gain recognition for our products  services  and technology and enhance our competitive position 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  distributors  and corporate partners and we enter into license agreements with respect to our software  documentation  and other proprietary information 
these license agreements are generally non transferable and have a perpetual term 
we also educate our employees on trade secret protection and employ measures to protect our facilities  equipment  and networks 
trademarks  patents  copyrights  and licenses symantec and the symantec logo are trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries 
in addition to symantec and the symantec logo  we have used  registered  and or applied to register other specific trademarks and service marks to help distinguish our products  technologies  and services from those of our competitors in the us and foreign countries and jurisdictions 
we enforce our trademark  service mark  and trade name rights in the us and abroad 
the duration of our trademark registrations varies from country to country  and in the us  we generally are able to maintain our trademark rights and renew any trademark registrations for as long as the trademarks are in use 
we have a number of us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications  including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions  which relate to various aspects of our products and technology 
the duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and for the us is typically years from the date of issuance of the patent or years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent  which we believe is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 
our products are protected under us and international copyright laws and laws related to the protection of intellectual property and proprietary information 
we take measures to label such products with the appropriate proprietary rights notices and we actively enforce such rights in the us and abroad 
however  these measures may not provide sufficient protection  and our intellectual property rights may be challenged 
in addition  we license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our products  and generally must rely on the third party to protect the licensed intellectual property rights 
while we believe that our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success  we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent  trademark  license  or other intellectual property right 
seasonality as is typical for many large software companies  a part of our business is seasonal 
software license orders are generally higher in our third and fourth fiscal quarters and lower in our first and second fiscal quarters 
a significant decline in license orders is typical in the first quarter of our fiscal year when compared to license orders in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
in addition  we generally receive a higher volume of software license orders in the last month of a quarter  with orders concentrated in the later part of that month 
we believe that this seasonality primarily reflects customer spending patterns and budget cycles  as well as the impact of compensation incentive plans for our sales personnel 
software license revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than license orders because license revenue is not recognized until an order is shipped and other revenue recognition criteria are met

risk factors if we are unable to develop new and enhanced products and services that achieve widespread market acceptance  or if we are unable to continually improve the performance  features  and reliability of our existing products and services  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
our future success depends on our ability to respond to the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing or introducing new products  product upgrades  and services on a timely basis 
we have in the past incurred  and will continue to incur  significant research and development expenses as we strive to remain competitive 
new product development and introduction involves a significant commitment of time and resources and is subject to a number of risks and challenges including managing the length of the development cycle for new products and product enhancements  which has frequently been longer than we originally expected adapting to emerging and evolving industry standards and to technological developments by our competitors and customers extending the operation of our products and services to new platforms and operating systems entering into new or unproven markets with which we have limited experience managing new product and service strategies  including integrating our various security and storage technologies  management solutions  customer service  and support into unified enterprise security and storage solutions incorporating acquired products and technologies developing or expanding efficient sales channels obtaining sufficient licenses to technology and technical access from operating system software vendors on reasonable terms to enable the development and deployment of interoperable products  including source code licenses for certain products with deep technical integration into operating systems if we are not successful in managing these risks and challenges  or if our new products  product upgrades  and services are not technologically competitive or do not achieve market acceptance  we could have expended substantial resources and capital without realizing sufficient revenues in return  and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents fluctuations in demand for our products and services are driven by many factors and a decrease in demand for our products could adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to fluctuations in demand for our products and services due to a variety of factors  including competition  product obsolescence  technological change  budget constraints of our actual and potential customers  level of broadband usage  awareness of security threats to it systems  and other factors 
while such factors may  in some periods  increase product sales  fluctuations in demand can also negatively impact our product sales 
for example  until recently we had experienced a higher than expected rate of growth in sales of our consumer security products that we believe was spurred  in part  by several well publicized threats to computer security 
as consumer attention to security threats fluctuates  the growth rates in sales of consumer security products have been impacted 
if demand for our products declines  our revenues and gross margin could be adversely affected 
we operate in a highly competitive environment  and our competitors may gain market share in the markets for our products that could adversely affect our business and cause our revenues to decline 
we operate in intensely competitive markets that experience rapid technological developments  changes in industry standards  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product introductions and improvements 
if we are unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges or if existing or new competitors gain market share in any of our markets  our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a drop in revenues that could adversely affect our business and operating results 
to compete successfully  we must maintain a successful research and development effort to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services  effectively adapt to changes in the technology or product rights held by our competitors  appropriately respond to competitive strategy  and effectively adapt to technological changes and changes in the ways that our information is accessed  used  and stored within our enterprise and consumer markets 
if we are unsuccessful in responding to our competitors or to changing technological and customer demands  we could experience a negative effect on our competitive position and our financial results 
our traditional competitors include independent software vendors which offer software products that directly compete with our product offerings 
in addition to competing with these vendors directly for sales to end users of our products  we compete with them for the opportunity to have our products bundled with the product offerings of our strategic partners such as computer hardware oems and isps 
our competitors could gain market share from us if any of these strategic partners replace our products with the products of our competitors or if they more actively promote our competitors products than our products 
in addition  software vendors who have bundled our products with theirs may choose to bundle their software with their own or other vendors software or may limit our access to standard product interfaces and inhibit our ability to develop products for their platform 
we face growing competition from network equipment and computer hardware manufacturers and large operating system providers 
these firms are increasingly developing and incorporating into their products data protection and storage and server management software that competes at some levels with our product offerings 
our competitive position could be adversely affected to the extent that our customers perceive the functionality incorporated into these products as replacing the need for our products 
microsoft has added remote access features to its operating systems and has made announcements of actual and anticipated product features and new product offerings that compete with a number of our product offerings 
in addition  we believe that microsoft has recently made changes to its operating systems that make it more difficult for independent security vendors to provide effective solutions for their customers 
we could be adversely affected if customers  particularly consumers  perceive that features incorporated into the microsoft operating system reduce the need for our products or if they prefer to purchase other microsoft products that are bundled with its operating systems and compete with our products 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales  marketing  or other resources than we do and consequently may have an ability to influence customers to purchase their products instead of ours 
we 
table of contents also face competition from many smaller companies that specialize in particular segments of the markets in which we compete 
if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels effectively or if our partners choose not to market and sell our products to their customers  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we sell our consumer products to individuals and small offices home offices around the world through multi tiered sales and distribution networks 
sales through these different channels involve distinct risks  including the following direct sales 
a significant portion of our revenues from enterprise products is derived from sales by our direct sales force to end users 
special risks associated with this sales channel include longer sales cycles associated with direct sales efforts difficulty in hiring  retaining  and motivating our direct sales forces substantial amounts of training for sales representatives to become productive  including regular updates to cover new and revised products indirect sales channels 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through indirect channels  including distributors that sell our products to end users and other resellers 
this channel involves a number of risks  including our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end users our resellers and distributors are not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers our reseller and distributor agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause our resellers and distributors frequently market and distribute competing products and may  from time to time  place greater emphasis on the sale of these products due to pricing  promotions  and other terms offered by our competitors oem sales channels 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales through our oem partners that incorporate our products into  or bundle our products with  their products 
our reliance on this sales channel involves many risks  including our lack of control over the shipping dates or volume of systems shipped our oem partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our products to their customers our oem partners may terminate or renegotiate their arrangements with us and new terms may be less favorable due  among other things  to an increasingly competitive relationship with certain partners sales through our oem partners are subject to changes in strategic direction  competitive risks  and other issues that could result in reduction of oem sales the development work that we must generally undertake under our agreements with our oem partners may require us to invest significant resources and incur significant costs with little or no associated revenues the time and expense required for the sales and marketing organizations of our oem partners to become familiar with our products may make it more difficult to introduce those products to the market our oem partners may develop  market  and distribute their own products and market and distribute products of our competitors  which could reduce our sales 
table of contents if we fail to manage our sales and distribution channels successfully  these channels may conflict with one another or otherwise fail to perform as we anticipate  which could reduce our sales and increase our expenses as well as weaken our competitive position 
some of our distribution partners have experienced financial difficulties in the past  and if our partners suffer financial difficulties in the future  we may have reduced sales or increased bad debt expense that could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  reliance on multiple channels subjects us to events that could cause unpredictability in demand  which could increase the risk that we may be unable to plan effectively for the future  and could result in adverse operating results in future periods 
we have grown  and may continue to grow  through acquisitions that give rise to risks and challenges that could adversely affect our future financial results 
we have in the past acquired  and we expect to acquire in the future  other businesses  business units  and technologies 
acquisitions involve a number of special risks and challenges  including complexity  time  and costs associated with the integration of acquired business operations  workforce  products  and technologies into our existing business  sales force  employee base  product lines  and technology diversion of management time and attention from our existing business and other business opportunities loss or termination of employees  including costs associated with the termination or replacement of those employees assumption of debt or other liabilities of the acquired business  including litigation related to alleged liabilities of the acquired business the incurrence of additional acquisition related debt as well as increased expenses and working capital requirements dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders  or earnings per share increased costs and efforts in connection with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act substantial accounting charges for restructuring and related expenses  write off of in process research and development  impairment of goodwill  amortization of intangible assets  and stock based compensation expense integrating acquired businesses has been and will continue to be a complex  time consuming  and expensive process  and can impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
for example  as disclosed in item a in this annual report  our management has identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that was largely related to symantec having insufficient personnel resources with adequate expertise to properly manage the increased volume and complexity of income tax matters arising from the acquisition of veritas 
if our ongoing integration of the veritas business is not successful  we may not realize the potential benefits of the acquisition or could undergo other adverse effects that we currently do not foresee 
to integrate acquired businesses  we must implement our technology systems in the acquired operations and integrate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations 
we also must effectively integrate the different cultures of acquired business organizations into our own in a way that aligns various interests  and may need to enter new markets in which we have no or limited experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions 
any of the foregoing  and other factors  could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired businesses or to realize other anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
in addition  because acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky  no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 

table of contents our international operations involve risks that could increase our expenses  adversely affect our operating results  and require increased time and attention of our management 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers located outside of the us and we have significant operations outside of the us  including engineering  sales  customer support  and production 
we plan to expand our international operations  but such expansion is contingent upon the financial performance of our existing international operations as well as our identification of growth opportunities 
our international operations are subject to risks in addition to those faced by our domestic operations  including potential loss of proprietary information due to misappropriation or laws that may be less protective of our intellectual property rights requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls  including trade and labor restrictions and related laws that reduce the flexibility of our business operations regulations or restrictions on the use  import  or export of encryption technologies that could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications central bank and other restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash from our international subsidiaries or to exchange cash in international subsidiaries into cash available for use in the us fluctuations in currency exchange rates and economic instability such as higher interest rates in the us and inflation that could reduce our customers ability to obtain financing for software products or that could make our products more expensive in certain countries limitations on future growth or inability to maintain current levels of revenues from international sales if we do not invest sufficiently in our international operations longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable difficulties in staffing  managing  and operating our international operations  including difficulties related to administering our stock plans in some foreign countries difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in europe and in other periods in other countries reduced sales due to the failure to obtain any required export approval of our technologies  particularly our encryption technologies costs and delays associated with developing software in multiple languages political unrest  war  or terrorism  particularly in areas in which we have facilities a significant portion of our transactions outside of the us are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  our future operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
we may be negatively affected by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future  especially if international sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales 
we receive significant tax benefits from sales to our non us customers 
these benefits are contingent upon existing tax regulations in the us and in the countries in which our international operations are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits 
our products are complex and operate in a wide variety of computer configurations  which could result in errors or product failures 
because we offer very complex products  undetected errors  failures  or bugs may occur  especially when products are first introduced or when new versions are released 
our products are often installed and used in 
table of contents large scale computing environments with different operating systems  system management software  and equipment and networking configurations  which may cause errors or failures in our products or may expose undetected errors  failures  or bugs in our products 
our customers computing environments are often characterized by a wide variety of standard and non standard configurations that make pre release testing for programming or compatibility errors very difficult and time consuming 
in addition  despite testing by us and others  errors  failures  or bugs may not be found in new products or releases until after commencement of commercial shipments 
in the past  we have discovered software errors  failures  and bugs in certain of our product offerings after their introduction and have experienced delayed or lost revenues during the period required to correct these errors 
errors  failures  or bugs in products released by us could result in negative publicity  product returns  loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  loss of competitive position  or claims by customers or others 
many of our end user customers use our products in applications that are critical to their businesses and may have a greater sensitivity to defects in our products than to defects in other  less critical  software products 
in addition  if an actual or perceived breach of information integrity or availability occurs in one of our end user customer s systems  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products  the market perception of the effectiveness of our products could be harmed 
alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions  delays  or cessation of our product licensing  which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees  lose key personnel  fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully  or fail to manage our employee base effectively  we may be unable to develop new and enhanced products and services  effectively manage or expand our business  or increase our revenues 
our future success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain our key management  technical  sales  marketing  finance  and other critical personnel 
our officers and other key personnel are employees at will  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them 
competition for people with the specific skills that we require is significant 
in order to attract and retain personnel in a competitive marketplace  we believe that we must provide a competitive compensation package  including cash and equity based compensation 
the volatility in our stock price may from time to time adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain employees 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future increases in the number of shares available for issuance under our equity compensation plans  and recent changes in accounting rules require us to treat the issuance of employee stock options and other forms of equity based compensation as compensation expense 
as a result  we may decide to issue fewer equity based incentives and may be impaired in our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel 
if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees  or conversely  if we fail to manage employee performance or reduce staffing levels when required by market conditions  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
key personnel have left our company in the past and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future 
the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations  including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases  the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives  the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting  and the results of our operations 
in addition  hiring  training  and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming  may cause additional disruptions to our operations  and may be unsuccessful  which could negatively impact future revenues 
we are a party to several class action and derivative action lawsuits  which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses  and which could  if not determined favorably  negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
we have been named as a party to several class action and derivative action lawsuits  and we may be named in additional litigation 
the expense of defending such litigation may be costly and divert manage 
table of contents ment s attention from the day to day operations of our business  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  an unfavorable outcome in such litigation could negatively impact our business  results of operations  and cash flows 
third parties claiming that we infringe their proprietary rights could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and prevent us from selling our products 
from time to time  we receive claims that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others  including claims regarding patents  copyrights  and trademarks 
in addition  former employers of our former  current  or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of these former employers 
any such claim  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation and distract management from day to day operations 
if we are not successful in defending such claims  we could be required to stop selling  delay shipments of or redesign our products  pay monetary amounts as damages  enter into royalty or licensing arrangements  or satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers 
in addition  we license and use software from third parties in our business 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms or at all  and may expose us to additional liability 
this liability  or our inability to use any of this third party software  could result in shipment delays or other disruptions in our business that could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
if we do not protect our proprietary information and prevent third parties from making unauthorized use of our products and technology  our financial results could be harmed 
our software and underlying technology are proprietary 
we seek to protect our proprietary rights through a combination of confidentiality agreements and procedures and through copyright  patent  trademark  and trade secret laws 
however  all of these measures afford only limited protection and may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented by third parties 
third parties may copy all or portions of our products or otherwise obtain  use  distribute  and sell our proprietary information without authorization 
third parties may also develop similar or superior technology independently  by designing around our patents 
our shrink wrap license agreements are not signed by licensees and therefore may be unenforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions 
furthermore  the laws of some foreign countries do not offer the same level of protection of our proprietary rights as the laws of the us  and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries 
the unauthorized copying or use of our products or proprietary information could result in reduced sales of our products 
any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in with a strategic partner or vendor could adversely affect our ability to access software  operating system  and hardware platforms of such partner or vendor  or cause such partner or vendor to choose not to offer our products to their customers 
in addition  any legal action to protect proprietary information that we may bring or be engaged in  alone or through our alliances with the business software alliance bsa  or the software information industry association siia  could be costly  may distract management from day to day operations  and may lead to additional claims against us  which could adversely affect our operating results 
some of our products contain open source software  and any failure to comply with the terms of one or more of these open source licenses could negatively affect our business 
certain of our products are distributed with software licensed by its authors or other third parties under so called open source licenses  which may include  by way of example the gnu general public license gpl  gnu lesser general public license lgpl  the mozilla public license  the bsd license  and the apache license 
some of these licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software  and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use 
if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner  we could  under certain of the open source licenses  be required to release the source code of our proprietary software 
in addition to risks related to license requirements  usage of open source software can 
table of contents lead to greater risks than use of third party commercial software  as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software 
we have established processes to help alleviate these risks  including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source  but we cannot be sure that all open source is submitted for approval prior to use in our products 
in addition  many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated  and could  if not properly addressed  negatively affect our business 
our software products and website may be subject to intentional disruption that could adversely impact our reputation and future sales 
although we believe we have sufficient controls in place to prevent intentional disruptions  we expect to be an ongoing target of attacks specifically designed to impede the performance of our products 
similarly  experienced computer programmers may attempt to penetrate our network security or the security of our website and misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions of our services 
because the techniques used by such computer programmers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
our activities could be adversely affected and our reputation and future sales harmed if these intentionally disruptive efforts are successful 
increased customer demands on our technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results 
we offer technical support services with many of our products 
we may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short term increases in customer demand for support services 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors or successfully integrate support for our customers 
further customer demand for these services  without corresponding revenues  could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results 
we have outsourced a substantial portion of our worldwide consumer support functions to third party service providers 
if these companies experience financial difficulties  do not maintain sufficiently skilled workers and resources to satisfy our contracts  or otherwise fail to perform at a sufficient level under these contracts  the level of support services to our customers may be significantly disrupted  which could materially harm our relationships with these customers 
accounting charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly financial results 
our financial results have been in the past  and may continue to be in the future  materially affected by non cash and other accounting charges  including amortization of intangible assets  including acquired product rights impairment of goodwill stock based compensation expense  including charges related to our adoption in the first quarter of fiscal of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  which will materially increase the stock based compensation expense included in our results of operations restructuring charges and reversals of those charges impairment of long lived assets for example  in connection with our acquisition of veritas  we have recorded approximately billion of intangible assets  including acquired product rights  and billion of goodwill 
we have recorded and will continue to record future amortization charges with respect to a portion of these intangible assets and stock based compensation expense related to the stock options to purchase veritas common stock assumed by us 
in addition  we will evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment  goodwill  acquired product rights  and other intangible assets  whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that these assets might be impaired 
goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or 
table of contents more frequently if events and circumstances warrant 
the foregoing types of accounting charges may also be incurred in connection with or as a result of other business acquisitions 
the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by the foregoing accounting charges 
our effective tax rate may increase or fluctuate  which could increase our income tax expense and reduce our net income 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control  including changes in the relative proportions of revenues and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates changing tax laws  regulations  and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the requirements of certain tax rulings changes in accounting and tax treatment of stock based compensation the tax effects of purchase accounting for acquisitions and restructuring charges that may cause fluctuations between reporting periods tax assessments  or any related tax interest or penalties  could significantly affect our income tax expense for the period in which the settlements take place the price of our common stock could decline to the extent that our financial results are materially affected by an adverse change in our effective tax rate 
we report our results of operations based on our determinations of the amount of taxes owed in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
from time to time  we receive notices that a tax authority to which we are subject has determined that we owe a greater amount of tax than we have reported to such authority  and we are regularly engaged in discussions  and sometimes disputes  with these tax authorities 
we are engaged in disputes of this nature at this time 
if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed in any of these jurisdictions is for an amount in excess of the tax provision we have recorded or reserved for  our operating results  cash flows  and financial condition could be adversely affected 
fluctuations in our quarterly financial results have affected the price of our common stock in the past and could affect our stock price in the future 
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and which could adversely affect our operations and operating results 
in addition  our acquisition of veritas makes it more difficult for us to predict  and securities analysts to develop expectations regarding  our future financial results due to the risks associated with the complexity of our combined business and the integration of our management teams and operations 
if our quarterly financial results or our predictions of future financial results fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  our stock price could be negatively affected 
any volatility in our quarterly financial results may make it more difficult for us to raise capital in the future or pursue acquisitions that involve issuances of our stock 
our operating results for prior periods may not be effective predictors of our future performance 
factors associated with our industry  the operation of our business  and the markets for our products may cause our quarterly financial results to fluctuate  including reduced demand for any of our products entry of new competition into our markets competitive pricing pressure for one or more of our classes of products our ability to timely complete the release of new or enhanced versions of our products 
table of contents the number  severity  and timing of threat outbreaks eg worms and viruses our resellers making a substantial portion of their purchases near the end of each quarter enterprise customers tendency to negotiate site licenses near the end of each quarter cancellation  deferral  or limitation of orders by customers fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates movement in interest rates the rate of adoption of new product technologies and new releases of operating systems weakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry conditions in any of the multiple markets in which we operate that could reduce customer demand and ability to pay for our products and services political and military instability  which could slow spending within our target markets  delay sales cycles  and otherwise adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and operate effectively budgetary constraints of customers  which are influenced by corporate earnings and government budget cycles and spending objectives disruptions in our highly automated business operations caused by  among other things  earthquakes  floods  or other natural disasters affecting our headquarters located in silicon valley  california  an area known for seismic activity  or our other locations worldwide acts of war or terrorism intentional disruptions by third parties any of the foregoing factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly 
our stock price may be volatile in the future  and you could lose the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future  and as a result you could lose the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including announcements of quarterly operating results and revenue and earnings forecasts by us that fail to meet or be consistent with our earlier projections or the expectations of our investors or securities analysts announcements by either our competitors or customers that fail to meet or be consistent with their earlier projections or the expectations of our investors or securities analysts rumors  announcements  or press articles regarding our operations  management  organization  financial condition  or financial statements changes in revenue and earnings estimates by us  our investors  or securities analysts accounting charges  including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill announcements of planned acquisitions by us or by our competitors announcements of new or planned products by us  our competitors  or our customers gain or loss of a significant customer inquiries by the sec  nasdaq  law enforcement  or other regulatory bodies acts of terrorism  the threat of war  and other crises or emergency situations economic slowdowns or the perception of an oncoming economic slowdown in any of the major markets in which we operate

the total purchase price of billion includes symantec common stock valued at billion  assumed stock options and restricted stock units  or rsus  with a fair value of million  and acquisition related expenses of million 
the acquisition of veritas will enable us to provide enterprise customers with a more effective way to secure and manage their most valuable asset  their information 
the combined company offers customers a broad portfolio of leading software and solutions across all tiers of the infrastructure 
we believe that this acquisition better positions us to help enable our customers to build a resilient it infrastructure  manage a complex heterogeneous it environment  and reduce overall it risk 
in addition  we believe that bringing together the market leading capabilities of symantec and veritas improves our ability to continuously optimize performance and help companies recover from disruptions when they occur 
as a result of the acquisition  we issued approximately million shares of symantec common stock  net of treasury stock retained  options to purchase million shares of symantec common stock  and  rsus  based on an exchange ratio of shares of symantec common stock for each outstanding share of veritas common stock as of july  the common stock issued had a fair value of billion and was valued using the average closing price of our common stock of over a range of trading days december  through december   inclusive around the announcement date december  of the transaction 
under the terms of the agreement  we assumed each outstanding option to purchase veritas common stock with an exercise price equal to or less than  as well as each additional option required to be assumed by applicable law 
each option assumed was converted into an option to purchase symantec common stock based upon the exchange ratio 
all other options to purchase shares of veritas common stock not exercised prior to the acquisition were cancelled immediately prior to the acquisition and were not converted or assumed by symantec 
in addition  we assumed all of the veritas outstanding rsus and converted them into  symantec rsus  after applying the exchange ratio 
the assumed options and rsus had a fair value of million 
in connection with the acquisition  we have recorded billion of goodwill  billion of acquired product rights  billion of other intangible assets  million of deferred stock based compensation  and billion of net tangible assets 
in addition  we wrote off acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  of million because the acquired technologies had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
we also incurred acquisition related expenses of million  which consisted of million for legal and other professional fees and million of restructuring costs for severance  associated benefits  outplacement services  and excess facilities 
the acquisition was structured to qualify as a tax free reorganization and we have accounted for it using the purchase method of accounting 
the results of veritas operations have been included in our results of operations beginning on july   and had a significant impact on our revenues  cost of revenues  and operating expenses during fiscal in connection with the acquisition of veritas  we assumed veritas contractual obligations related to its deferred revenue 
veritas deferred revenue was derived from maintenance  consulting  education  and other services 
we estimated our obligation related to veritas deferred revenue using the cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs relating to fulfilling the obligation plus a normal profit margin 
the sum of the costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligation were based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support 
as a result  we recorded an adjustment to reduce the carrying value of deferred revenue by million to million  which represents our estimate of the fair value of the contractual obligations assumed 
the veritas business is included in our data protection  storage and server management  and services segments 

table of contents other fiscal acquisitions during fiscal  in addition to veritas  we completed acquisitions of five privately held companies and one public company for million in cash  including acquisition related expenses resulting from financial advisory  legal and accounting services  duplicate sites  and severance costs 
xtreamlok pty 
ltd and substantially all of wholesecurity  inc are included in our consumer products segment  sygate technologies  inc  the remainder of wholesecurity  bindview development corporation  and imlogic  inc are included in our enterprise security segment  and relicore  inc 
is included in our storage and server management segment 
our business our operating segments are significant strategic business units that offer different products and services  distinguished by customer needs 
as of march   we had six operating segments consumer products 
our consumer products segment focuses on delivering our internet security and problem solving products to individual users  home offices  and small businesses 
enterprise security 
our enterprise security segment provides security solutions for all tiers of a network at the server tier behind the gateway and at the client tier  including desktop personal computers  or pcs  laptops  and handhelds 
data protection 
our data protection segment provides software products designed to protect  backup  archive  and restore data across a broad range of computing environments from large corporate data centers to remote groups and pc clients  such as desktop and laptop computers 
storage and server management 
our storage and server management segment provides solutions to simplify and automate the administration of heterogeneous storage and server environments and provide continuous availability of mission critical applications 
services 
our services segment provides a full range of consulting and educational services to assist our customers in assessing  architecting  implementing  supporting  and maintaining their security  storage  and infrastructure software solutions 
other 
our other segment is comprised of sunset products and products nearing the end of their life cycle and also includes all indirect costs  general and administrative expenses  amortization of acquired product rights  other intangible assets  and other assets  and charges  such as acquired in process research and development  patent settlement  amortization of deferred compensation  and restructuring  that are not charged to the other operating segments 
the expenses of the former veritas sales force that cannot be allocated to a specific operating segment are also reported in the other segment 
we expect this treatment to continue until we have completed the realignment of our combined sales force 
in the quarter ended september  we renamed the enterprise administration segment to be the storage and server management segment and added the data protection segment 
in the quarter ended june  we moved managed security services from the services segment to the enterprise security segment and moved the services related revenue previously included in the storage and server management segment to the services segment 
net revenues for fiscal and have been reclassified to conform to our current presentation 
specifically  we reclassified million and million of managed security services revenue from the services segment to the enterprise security segment  and million and an insignificant amount of services related revenue from the storage and server management segment to the services segment for fiscal and  respectively 
beginning in the june quarter  we will consolidate our enterprise security  data protection  and storage and server management segments into two segments the security and data management segment and the data center management segment 

table of contents financial results our net income was million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively  representing diluted net income per share of   and  respectively 
the decreased profitability in fiscal is primarily due to the write off of acquired ipr d and increased amortization of acquired product rights and other intangible assets as a result of the veritas acquisition  as well as non merger related restructuring charges 
in addition  we experienced an increase in operating expenses primarily attributable to the veritas acquisition  and specifically an increase in employee headcount and related compensation 
as of march   employee headcount increased by approximately from march  approximately of the increase was due to the veritas acquisition 
fiscal delivered global revenue growth across all of our geographic regions as compared to fiscal and the overall growth is due primarily to the veritas acquisition and is also partly attributable to increased awareness of internet related threats around the world 
weakness in most major foreign currencies negatively impacted our international revenue growth by million in fiscal compared to fiscal we are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
if international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future  changes in foreign exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results 
in the december quarter  we released our consumer products and increased subscription pricing for those consumer products that include content updates 
as a result  revenue for the consumer products that include content updates is recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the license 
in addition  beginning in the december quarter  this revenue is now classified as content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue 
cash flows were strong in fiscal as we delivered over billion in operating cash flow 
we ended fiscal with billion in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
on april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment 
we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  which include judgments and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
historically  our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions 
if actual results differ from these estimates and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of income  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on liquidity and our financial condition 
a critical accounting estimate is based on judgments and assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in accounting estimates could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe that the estimates described below represent our critical accounting estimates  as they have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we also refer you to our summary of significant accounting policies beginning on page of this annual report 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
revenue recognition requirements in the software industry are very complex and require us to make many estimates 
in arrangements that include multiple elements  including perpetual software licenses and maintenance and or services  and packaged products with content updates  we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of the undelivered elements  and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
our deferred revenue consists primarily of the unamortized balance of enterprise product maintenance and consumer product content updates and totaled approximately billion as of march   of which million was presented as long term deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets 
vsoe of each element is based on the price for which the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine fair value of the undelivered elements based on historical evidence of our stand alone sales of these elements to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the undelivered elements 
when vsoe does not exist for undelivered items such as maintenance  then the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of recognized and deferred revenue 
for our consumer products that include content updates  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users 
associated cost of revenues is also recorded ratably 
we record as deferred revenue and inventory the respective revenue and cost of revenue amounts of unsold product held by our distributors and resellers 
we expect our distributors and resellers to maintain adequate inventory of consumer packaged products to meet future customer demand  which is generally four or six weeks of customer demand based on recent buying trends 
we ship product to our distributors and resellers at their request and based on their valid purchase orders 
our distributors and resellers base the quantity of their orders on their estimates to meet future customer demand  which may exceed our expected level of a four or six week supply 
we offer limited rights of return if the inventory held by our distributors and resellers is below the expected level of a four or six week supply 
we estimate future returns under these limited rights of return in accordance with sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
we typically offer liberal rights of return if inventory held by our distributors and resellers exceeds the expected level 
because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of excess inventory that will be returned  we primarily offset deferred revenue against trade accounts receivable for the amount of revenue in excess of the expected inventory levels 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues and cost of revenues for any period presented 
reserves for product returns we reserve for estimated product returns as an offset to revenue based primarily on historical trends 
we fully reserve for obsolete products in the distribution channels as an offset to revenue 
if we made different estimates  material differences could result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
more or less product may be returned than what was estimated and or the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what was estimated 
these factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make actual results differ from our return estimates 
reserves for rebates we estimate and record reserves for channel and end user rebates as an offset to revenue 
for consumer products that include content updates  rebates are recorded as a ratable offset to revenue over the term of the subscription 
our estimated reserves for channel volume incentive rebates are based on distributors and resellers actual performance against the terms and conditions of volume incentive rebate programs  which are typically entered into quarterly 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on 
table of contents the terms and conditions of the promotional programs  actual sales during the promotion  amount of actual redemptions received  historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program  and the value of the rebate 
we also consider current market conditions and economic trends when estimating our reserves for rebates 
if we made different estimates  material differences may result in the amount and timing of our net revenues for any period presented 
business combinations when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies 
these estimates can include  but are not limited to  the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the appropriate weighted average cost of capital  and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
at march   goodwill was billion  other intangible assets  net were billion  and acquired product rights  net were billion 
we assess the impairment of goodwill within our reporting units annually  or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units  which are the same as our operating segments  to its carrying value  including the goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 
to determine the reporting units fair values in the current year evaluation  we used the income approach under which we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the estimated discounted future cash flows of that unit 
our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs  and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our goodwill could change significantly 
such change could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we assess the impairment of acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount 
such impairment loss would be measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
our cash flow assumptions are based on historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs  and other relevant factors 
if management s estimates of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of our acquired product rights and other identifiable intangible assets could change significantly 
such change could result in impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for excess facilities we have estimated expenses for excess facilities related to consolidating  moving  and relocating personnel or sites as a result of restructuring activities and business acquisitions 
in determining our estimates  we obtain information from third party leasing agents to calculate anticipated third party sublease income and the vacancy period prior to finding a sub lessee 
market conditions may affect our ability to sublease facilities on terms consistent with our estimates 
our ability to sublease facilities on schedule or to negotiate lease terms resulting in higher or lower sublease income than estimated may affect our accrual for site closures 
in addition  differences between estimated and actual related broker commissions  tenant improvements  and related exit costs may increase or decrease our accrual upon final negotiation 
if we made different estimates regarding these various components of our excess facilities costs  the amount recorded for any period presented could vary materially from those actually recorded 

table of contents income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each federal  state  and international jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires that we estimate the current tax exposure as well as assess temporary differences between the accounting and tax treatment of assets and liabilities  including items such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
the income tax effects of the differences we identify are classified as current or long term deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
our judgments  assumptions  and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income 
we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  based on this assessment  establish a valuation allowance  if required 
our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions  judgments  and estimates  including forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the valuation allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in our consolidated statements of income 
we failed to timely file the final pre acquisition tax return for veritas  and as a result  it is uncertain whether we can claim a lower tax rate on a dividend made from a veritas foreign subsidiary under the american jobs creation act of we are currently petitioning the irs for relief to allow us to claim the lower rate of tax 
because we were unable to obtain this relief prior to filing the veritas tax return in may  we have paid million of additional us taxes 
the potential outcomes with respect to our payment of this amount include if we ultimately obtain relief from the irs on this matter  the million that we paid in may will be refunded to us and we will use that amount to reestablish our income tax accrual for the veritas transfer pricing disputes 
if we ultimately do not receive relief from the irs on this matter  and we otherwise have an adjustment arising from the veritas transfer pricing disputes  then we would only owe additional tax with regard to such disputes to the extent that such adjustment is in excess of million 
if we ultimately do not receive relief from the irs on this matter  and we otherwise do not have an adjustment arising from the veritas transfer pricing disputes  then we would be required to adjust the purchase price of veritas to reflect a reduction in the amount of pre acquisition tax liabilities assumed  and we would be required to recognize an equal amount of income tax expense  up to million 
legal contingencies from time to time  we are involved in disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business  and we do not expect this trend to change in the future 
we are currently involved in legal proceedings as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  as well as other legal matters 
when the likelihood of the incurrence of costs related to our legal proceedings is probable and management has the ability to estimate such costs  we provide for estimates of external legal fees and any probable losses through charges to our consolidated statements of income 
these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and intervening events 
prior to our acquisition of veritas  veritas had been in discussions with the staff of the sec regarding the sec s review of certain matters  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and based on communications with the staff  veritas expected these discussions to result in a settlement with the sec in which we would be required to pay a million penalty 
as part of our accounting for the 
table of contents acquisition of veritas  we recorded an accrual related to this matter of million which is included in other accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets as of march  in addition  we are involved in other pending legal matters  for which our accrual for legal contingencies represented insignificant amounts related to external legal fees 
however  even if we are successful in our pending legal matters  estimated costs for external legal fees could be more than anticipated 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful  we could be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees for which we have not accrued any amounts for loss contingencies  or to modify our business practices 
any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
results of operations total net revenues year ended march  in thousands net revenues period over period increase net revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to sales of products acquired through the veritas acquisition  which contributed billion of net revenues in fiscal in addition  revenues from our enterprise security products increased million and revenues from our consumer products increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increased revenues from these products were due primarily to continuing growth in demand for our enterprise virus protection and anti spam solutions as well as our consumer security protection products  as described further in the segment discussions that follow 
beginning in the december quarter  as a result of increases in future subscription pricing for our consumer products that include content updates  revenue for these products is recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the subscription 
net revenues increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to increases of million and million in revenue from our consumer and enterprise security products  respectively 
the increased revenue from these products was due primarily to continuing growth in demand for our consumer security protection products and our enterprise virus protection products 
we believe that a significant portion of the growth in demand was attributable to the continued increase in vulnerabilities  internet attacks  and malicious code activity coupled with a growing level of awareness of these threats around the world 
content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues year ended march  in thousands content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period increase content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue includes arrangements for software maintenance and technical support for our products  content and subscription services primarily related to our security products  revenue from arrangements where vsoe of the fair value of undelivered elements does not exist  and managed security services 
these arrangements are generally offered to our customers over a specified period of time and we recognize the related revenue ratably over the maintenance  subscription  or service period 
beginning with the release of our consumer products that include content updates in the december 
table of contents quarter  we recognize revenue related to these products ratably 
as a result  this revenue has been classified as content  subscriptions  and maintenance beginning in the december quarter 
content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue also includes professional services revenue  which consists primarily of the fees we earn related to consulting and educational services 
we generally recognize revenue from our professional services as the services are performed or upon written acceptance from customers  if applicable  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to sales of products acquired through the veritas acquisition  which contributed million of content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue related to our consumer security products increased million as compared to fiscal due primarily to the classification of million of consumer revenue as content  subscriptions  and maintenance rather than licenses in fiscal revenue related to our enterprise security products increased million  primarily due to increased awareness of information security threats 
content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to increases of million and million in revenue from our consumer and enterprise security products  respectively 
the increased sales of these products were due primarily due to increased awareness of information security threats and continuing growth in demand for our consumer security protection products and our enterprise virus protection solutions 
licenses revenue year ended march  in thousands licenses revenue percentage of total net revenues period over period increase decrease licenses revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to sales of products acquired through the veritas acquisition  which contributed million of licenses revenue in fiscal our consumer products that include content updates were released in the december quarter  and we recognize revenue related to these products ratably as content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenues  which resulted in a decrease in licenses revenue of million in fiscal competitive pressures  a lack of recent high profile information security threat activity  and to a lesser extent  a decrease in licensing of our enterprise security products  also partially offset the overall increase in licenses revenue 
licenses revenue decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to a million decrease in consumer products revenue 
in fiscal  our consumer products had a higher subscription component than in fiscal  resulting in more revenue being classified as content  subscriptions  and maintenance in fiscal net revenues by segment consumer products segment year ended march  in thousands consumer products revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period increase 
table of contents the increase in consumer products revenues in fiscal was due primarily to an increase of million in revenue from our norton internet security products as compared to fiscal the majority of the increase in revenue was booked through our electronic distribution channel that includes original equipment manufacturer  or oem  subscriptions  upgrades  online sales  and renewals 
this increase was partially offset by the change in our consumer product revenue recognition model for our consumer products that include content updates 
beginning in the december quarter  as a result of increases in future subscription pricing for our consumer products that include content updates  revenue for these products is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription upon sell through to end users 
this change in our product revenue recognition model resulted in a reduction in consumer products revenues for fiscal in addition  revenue from our norton antivirus products decreased million as our customers continue to migrate to the norton internet security products  which offer broader protection to address the rapidly changing threat environment 
revenue from our electronic distribution channel which includes sales of our norton internet security products and our norton antivirus products grew by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal we believe that  in addition to the factors noted above  the lower growth rate in our consumer products segment was attributable to a changing threat environment and a strengthening us dollar 
in addition  during fiscal  pricing for subscriptions increased  while pricing in retail and online stores remained consistent or decreased 
we believe that a significant portion of the increase in consumer products revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was attributable to the continued increase in vulnerabilities  internet attacks  and malicious code activity coupled with a growing level of awareness of these threats around the world 
specifically  the increase in our consumer products revenues in fiscal was due primarily to an increase of million in revenue from our norton internet security products and an increase of million in revenue from our norton antivirus products 
revenue from our electronic distribution channel grew by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal enterprise security segment year ended march  in thousands enterprise security revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period increase the increase in our enterprise security revenue in fiscal was due to increased growth from our anti spam products and lower but continued growth from our enterprise antivirus products 
specifically  the increase in our enterprise security revenue was due primarily to an increase of million in revenue from our enterprise antivirus products  and an increase of million in revenue from our antispam products during fiscal as compared to fiscal revenue from our enterprise security segment increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to an increase of million in revenue from our enterprise antivirus products 
in addition  revenue increased due to sales of antispam products formerly associated with brightmail  which we acquired in june data protection segment the data protection segment is comprised of products acquired through the veritas acquisition 
fiscal revenue from this segment of million was comprised primarily of revenue related to backup exec products and netbackup products of million and million  respectively 
the remaining revenue was comprised of revenue related to enterprise vault products 

table of contents storage and server management segment year ended march  in thousands storage and server management revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period increase percentage not meaningful the increase in revenues from our storage and server management segment was due primarily to sales of products acquired through the veritas acquisition  which contributed million of net revenues during fiscal this amount was offset slightly by the continued decline in sales of our pcanywhere product  which we expect to continue to decline in the future 
revenue from our storage and server management segment increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to revenue from products formerly associated with powerquest of million and on technology of million  both of which we acquired in the second half of fiscal these increases were partially offset by a continued decline in sales of our pcanywhere product 
services segment year ended march  in thousands services revenues percentage of total net revenues period over period increase percentage not meaningful the increase in revenue from our services segment in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to services related to the veritas acquisition  which contributed million of net revenues during fiscal in addition  the increase was due to an increase in our security consulting services of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in revenue from our services segment in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to an increase of million in revenue from our consulting services 
in addition  revenue from our services segment increased due to our acquisitions in fiscal of stake  inc and liric associates 
other segment our other segment is comprised of sunset products and products nearing the end of their life cycle 
revenues from the other segment in fiscal   and were insignificant 

table of contents net revenues by geographic region year ended march  in thousands north america us and canada percentage of total net revenues period over period increase emea europe  middle east  and africa percentage of total net revenues period over period increase asia pacific japan percentage of total net revenues period over period increase latin america percentage of total net revenues period over period increase total net revenues north america includes net revenues from the united states of billion and canada of million during fiscal north america includes net revenues from the united states of billion and canada of million during fiscal north america includes net revenues from the united states of million and canada of million during fiscal the increase in net revenues in international regions in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to revenue from products acquired through the veritas acquisition  which contributed million of net revenues in international regions 
increased sales of our norton internet security products in our consumer products segment and our antivirus and antispam products in our enterprise security segment also contributed to the increase in net revenue in the international regions in fiscal  while the change to ratable revenue recognition with the release of the consumer products that include content updates partially offset this increase 
weakness in most major foreign currencies negatively impacted our international revenue growth by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal we are unable to predict the extent to which revenues in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
if international sales become a greater portion of our total sales in the future  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potentially greater impact on our revenues and operating results 
the increase in net revenues in international regions in fiscal was due to increased revenue from our norton internet security and norton antivirus products in our consumer products segment and our antivirus products in our enterprise security segment in those regions 
we believe this increase in sales is attributable to increased customer awareness related to security threats 
in addition  strength in major foreign currencies positively impacted our international revenue growth in fiscal by million as compared to fiscal the strength in foreign currencies in fiscal was due primarily to the strength of the euro 

table of contents cost of revenues year ended march  in thousands cost of revenues gross margin period over period increase percentage not meaningful cost of revenues consists primarily of amortization of acquired product rights  fee based technical support costs  costs of billable services  payments to oems under revenue sharing arrangements  manufacturing and direct material costs  and royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements 
gross margin decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to increased amortization of acquired product rights resulting from certain identifiable intangible assets acquired through the veritas acquisition 
costs for services and technical support also increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal these increases were partially offset by ratable recognition of costs for consumer products that include content updates  which are recognized ratably over the term of the license beginning in the december quarter 
we anticipate that our net revenues from our services segment may grow to comprise a higher percentage of our total net revenues  which would have a negative impact on our gross margin  as our services typically have higher cost of revenues than our software products 
gross margin remained flat at approximately in fiscal and fiscal cost of content  subscriptions  and maintenance year ended march  in thousands cost of content  subscriptions  and maintenance as a of related revenue period over period increase cost of content  subscriptions  and maintenance consists primarily of fee based technical support costs  costs of billable services  and payments to oems under revenue sharing agreements 
cost of content  subscriptions  and maintenance increased as a percentage of the related revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to sales of products acquired through the veritas acquisition  which contributed million of additional costs and contributed of the related content  subscriptions  and maintenance revenue in fiscal in addition  costs related to our security services consulting segment and enterprise security products increased million and million  respectively 
cost of content  subscriptions  and maintenance increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to revenue from our consumer products  which contributed million of additional cost in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  cost related to our security services consulting segment and our enterprise security products increased million and million  respectively 

table of contents cost of licenses year ended march  in thousands cost of licenses as a of related revenue period over period decrease cost of licenses consists primarily of royalties paid to third parties under technology licensing agreements and manufacturing and direct material costs 
cost of licenses decreased as a percentage of the related revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to lower costs associated with products acquired through the veritas acquisition 
the veritas acquisition added million of costs  which was offset by a million decrease in consumer products license costs as compared to fiscal these costs and the associated revenue are reported as content  subscriptions  and maintenance beginning with the release of our consumer products that include content updates  as we now recognize the revenue and related costs ratably over the content update period 
cost of licenses decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to a million decrease in consumer licenses costs as compared to fiscal in fiscal  our consumer products had a higher subscription component 
therefore  these costs and the associated revenue are reported as content  subscriptions  and maintenance 
the decrease in licenses costs in fiscal was partially offset by a million increase in cost related to our storage management products 
amortization of acquired product rights year ended march  in thousands amortization of acquired product rights percentage of total net revenues period over period increase percentage not meaningful acquired product rights are comprised of developed technologies  revenue related order backlog and contracts  and patents from acquired companies 
the increased amortization in fiscal is primarily associated with the veritas acquisition  for which amortization began in july in connection with the veritas acquisition  we recorded billion in acquired product rights which are being amortized over their expected useful lives of three months to five years 
we amortize the fair value of all other acquired product rights over their expected useful lives  generally one to eight years

the ipr d was written off because the acquired technologies had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to completion of a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
at the time of the acquisition in july  veritas was developing new products in multiple product areas that qualify as ipr d 
these efforts included netbackup  backup exec  server management  and various other projects 
at the time of the acquisition  it was estimated that these ipr d development efforts would be completed over the following to months at an estimated total cost of million 
at march   the development efforts were continuing on schedule and within expected costs 
the value assigned to the veritas ipr d was determined by estimating costs to develop the purchased ipr d into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed  and discounting the net cash flows to their present values 
the revenue estimates used in the net cash flow forecasts were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology  and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by veritas and its competitors 
the rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present values was based on veritas weighted average cost of capital 
the weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  the percentage of completion of each project  anticipated market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates  and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
based on these factors  a discount rate of was deemed appropriate for valuing the ipr d 
the estimates used in valuing ipr d were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
in fiscal  we wrote off million of ipr d in connection with our acquisition of brightmail

table of contents development  and testing activities that were necessary to establish that the product could be produced to meet its design specifications  including features  functions  and performance 
we determined the fair value of the acquired ipr d by estimating the projected cash flows related to the projects and future revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products 
we discounted the resulting net cash flows to their present values 
we based the net cash flows from such projects on our analysis of the respective markets and estimates of revenues and operating profits related to these projects 
in fiscal  we wrote off million of ipr d in connection with our acquisitions of on technology  powerquest  and nexland

the remaining reserve amount of million will be paid over the remaining lease terms  ending at various dates through the majority of the costs are currently scheduled to be paid by the end of fiscal with regard to the veritas facilities restructuring plan  our actual costs have varied and could continue to vary significantly from our current estimates  depending  in part  on the commercial real estate market in the applicable metropolitan areas  our ability to obtain subleases related to these facilities and the time period to do so  the sublease rental market rates  and the outcome of negotiations with lessors regarding terminations of some of the leases 
some of these factors are beyond our control

table of contents provision for income taxes year ended march  in thousands tax provision on earnings effective tax rate on earnings tax provision on repatriation total tax provision total effective tax rate our effective tax rate on income before taxes was approximately   and in fiscal   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for fiscal reflects the impact of the ipr d charges and other acquisition related charges that are nondeductible for tax reporting purposes  partially offset by foreign earnings taxed at a lower rate than the us tax rate  and the effect of the true up of taxes on repatriated earnings 
the effective tax rate in fiscal reflects the additional tax expense attributable to the million of foreign earnings that we repatriated under the american jobs creation act 
we believe realization of substantially all of our deferred tax assets as of march  of million  after application of the valuation allowance  is more likely than not based on the future reversal of temporary tax differences 
realization of approximately million of our deferred tax assets as of march  is dependent upon future taxable earnings exclusive of reversing temporary differences in certain foreign jurisdictions 
levels of future taxable income are subject to the various risks and uncertainties discussed in item a  risk factors  set forth in this annual report 
an additional valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets may be necessary if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we will assess the need for an additional valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets increased by million in fiscal  of which approximately million is attributable to acquisition related assets  the benefit of which will reduce goodwill when and if realized 
the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets increased by an immaterial amount in fiscal american jobs creation act of repatriation of foreign earnings in the march quarter  we repatriated million from certain of our foreign subsidiaries that qualified for the dividends received deduction under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of  or the jobs act  enacted in october we recorded a tax charge for this repatriation of million in the march quarter 
in may  clarifying language was issued by the us department of treasury and the irs with respect to the treatment of foreign taxes paid on the earnings repatriated under the jobs act and in september  additional clarifying language was issued regarding the treatment of certain deductions attributable to the earnings repatriation 
as a result of this clarifying language  we reduced the tax expense attributable to the repatriation by approximately million in fiscal  which reduced the cumulative tax charge on the repatriation to million 
the million repatriation under the jobs act was deemed to be distributed entirely from foreign earnings that had been previously treated as indefinitely reinvested 
however  this distribution from previously indefinitely reinvested earnings does not change our position going forward that future earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries will be indefinitely reinvested 
other tax matters on march   we received a notice of deficiency from the irs claiming that we owe additional taxes  plus interest and penalties  for the and tax years based on an audit of veritas  which we acquired in july the incremental tax liability asserted by the irs with regard to the veritas claim is million  excluding penalties and interest 
the notice of deficiency primarily relates to transfer pricing in connection with a technology license agreement between veritas and a foreign subsidiary 
we do not agree 
table of contents with the irs position and we intend to file a timely petition to the tax court to protest the assessment 
no payments will be made on the assessment until the issue is definitively resolved 
if  upon resolution  we are required to pay an amount in excess of our provision for this matter  the incremental amounts due would be accounted for principally as additions to the veritas purchase price as an increase to goodwill 
any incremental interest accrued subsequent to the date of the veritas acquisition would be recorded as an expense in the period the matter is resolved 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we made million of tax related adjustments to the purchase accounting for veritas  consisting of million of additional pre acquisition tax reserve related adjustments  partially offset by a million reduction in other pre acquisition taxes payable 
while we strongly disagree with the irs over both its transfer pricing methodologies and the amount of the assessment  we have established additional tax reserves for all veritas pre acquisition years to account for both contingent tax and interest risk 
on march   we received notices of proposed adjustment from the irs with regard to an unrelated audit of symantec for fiscal years and the irs claimed that we owed an incremental tax liability with regard to this audit of million  excluding penalties and interest 
the incremental tax liability primarily relates to transfer pricing matters between symantec and a foreign subsidiary 
on june   we reached an agreement in principle with the irs to settle the irs claims relating to this audit for million  excluding interest 
the consolidated financial statements presented in this annual report reflect adequate accruals to address this settlement amount 
we anticipate that we will finalize this settlement with the irs before the end of june in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we increased our tax reserves by an additional million in connection with all open symantec tax years fiscal to 
since these reserves relate to licensing arising from acquired technology  the additional accruals are primarily offset by deferred taxes 
we are as yet unable to confirm our eligibility to claim a lower tax rate on a distribution made from a veritas foreign subsidiary prior to the acquisition 
the distribution was intended to be made pursuant to the jobs act  and therefore eligible for a effective us federal rate of tax  in lieu of the statutory rate 
we are seeking a ruling from the irs on the matter 
because we were unable to obtain this ruling prior to filing the veritas tax return in may  we have paid million of additional us taxes 
since this payment relates to the taxability of foreign earnings that are otherwise the subject of the irs assessment  this additional payment reduced the amount of taxes payable accrued as part of the purchase accounting for pre acquisition contingent tax risks

exchange rate sensitivity we conduct business in currencies through our worldwide operations 
we believe that the use of foreign exchange forward contracts should reduce the risks that arise from conducting business in international markets 
we hedge certain risks associated with certain foreign currency cash and cash equivalents  investments  receivables  and payables in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency fluctuations on these assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign exchange forward contracts as of march  were as follows in millions hypothetical increase decrease in fv of foreign forward exchange contracts given x appreciation devaluation of foreign currency notional foreign forward exchange contracts amount purchased sold 
table of contents we believe that these foreign exchange forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk from the movement of foreign exchange rates because gains and losses on these contracts are offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities 
all contracts have a maturity of no more than days 
gains and losses are accounted for as interest and other income  net each period 
we regularly review our hedging program and may make changes as a result of this review
