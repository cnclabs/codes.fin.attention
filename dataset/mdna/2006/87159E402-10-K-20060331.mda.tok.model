liquidity and capital resources year end working capital   assets   liabilities   equity   line of credit facility   receivable turnover days inventory turnover days net cash used in operating activies   net cash used in provided by investing activities   net cash provided by financing activites   the company reduced its cash requirements from operating activities by from million to million from to the reason was a net decrease of million in the net increase of accounts receivables and other receivables from million to  liquidity for the company predominately involves the need to finance accounts receivables  inventory  financing costs and operating expenses 
the cash flow realized from the company s gross profit was not sufficient to cover the company s operating expenses 
the company generated a net loss of approximately million 
financing costs totaled million and represented the largest cost center for the company 
reductions in financing expenses would be beneficial to the company s performance 
this reduction could be achieved through equity based transactions  refinancing at lower rates and a reduction of the company s inventory and accounts receivables 
management believes that equity based transactions and refinancing should be the objectives for the company 
a reduction in receivables and inventory may cause a reduction in revenue  which would reduce operating margins 
although the company improved its cash flow from operating activities by million  it needed to secure funds from financing activities to cover its operating needs 
the company financed its operating activities by issuing million in notes and  in preferred stock 
the company s working capital improved by million to million due to a  reduction in the company s line of credit and a million reduction in accounts payable 
receivables increased by  due to revenue increases and vendor rebates 
notes receivable increased by  predominately due to the company s investment in perx 
notes payable had a corresponding increase due to the proceeds derived in a loan from a major shareholder 
the company raised million is equity predominately due to note conversions under existing agreements 
the company acquired sufficient capital to cover its operating expenses and had unused availability of million under its line of credit 
the company believes that it has sufficient availability under its line of credit and an ability to raise sufficient capital to cover its operating losses 
however  the company believes that it needs to generate an operating profit and not rely on external financing whether debt or equity 
the capital resources available to the company consist of million in lines of credit  million in long term notes and million in preferred stock 
the company s objective is to reduce its notes through the issuance of equity and cash flow as well as refinancing its current obligations with lower rates 
however there is no assurance that the company would be able to achieve its objectives 
the company s liquidity relies on the turnover of it inventory and accounts receivables 
the company reduced its receivable turnover from days to days and its inventory turnover remained flat at days 
the company believes that its collection procedures and procurement policies are consistent with industry standards 
however  nearly of the company s assets consist of trade receivables and inventory 
the company must maintain a strict policy on insuring collections of receivables and adequate procurement based upon customer demands 
management believes that continued cost containment  improved financial and operating controls  debt reduction  and a focused sales and marketing effort should provide sufficient cash flow from operations in the near term and the company is working toward reliance on such financial sources and attributes to cover its cash flow requirements but achievement of these goals  however  will likely continue to be dependent upon the company s attainment of increased revenues  improved operating costs  reduced financing cost and trade support levels that are consistent with management s plans 
such operating performance will be subject to financial  economic and other factors beyond its control  and there can be no assurance that the company s goals will be achieved 
in the interim while such goals are being pursued achievement of positive cash flow has been reliant on equity and debt financing  including the company s exchange of notes payable for common shares and its issuance of further common and preferred stock in private placements and the company is hopeful that the market will continue to recognize the company s stature so that such financing method will continue to be available in the future because  at least in the near future  the company is likely to continue to use such financing opportunities to maintain adequate cash flow 
expected interest payments on notes payable for the period ended december  are as follows total variable interest rate on notes of  was

the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and disclosures on the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates 
management uses authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making judgments 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the company s financial statements 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s accounts receivable are due from businesses engaged in the distribution of grocery  health and beauty products as well as from consumers who purchase health and beauty products and premium handmade cigars from the company s web sites 
credit is extended based on evaluation of a customers financial condition and  generally  collateral may be required 
accounts receivable are due within days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the company s historical collections experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of its accounts receivable by aging category 
in determining these percentages  the company looks at historical write offs of its receivables 
the company also looks at the credit quality of its customer base as well as changes in its credit policies 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers 
the company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax purposes 
deferred tax assets are primarily comprised of reserves  which have been deducted for financial statement purposes  but have not been deducted for income tax purposes as well as net operating loss carry forwards 
the company annually reviews the deferred tax asset accounts to determine if is appears more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
at december   the company has established a full valuation allowance 
valuation of long lived assets 
the company reviews its long lived assets periodically to determine potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets with expected net cash flows expected to be provided by the operating activities of the business or related products 
should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value  the company would determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized 
an impairment loss would be measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the long lived assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from use of the assets and their ultimate disposition 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying amount of the asset would be written down to an amount to reflect the fair value of the asset 
recent pronouncements of the financial accounting standards board fasb in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services 
this statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r requires that the fair value of such equity instruments be recognized as an expense in the historical financial statements as services are performed

seasonality sales by phs group and proset usually peak at the end of the calendar quarter  when the company s suppliers offer promotions which lower prices and  in turn  the company is able to lower its prices and increase sales volume 
suppliers tend to promote at quarter end and as a result reduced products costs may increase sales 
in particular  first and second quarters are usually better operating quarters 
sales of beauty care products and fragrances increase over traditional gift giving holidays such as christmas  mother s day  father s day  and valentine s day 
cigar product sales also increase during holiday periods and summer months as well as around special sporting events 
inflation the company believes that inflation  under certain circumstances  could be beneficial to the company s major business  phs group 
when inflationary pressures drive product costs up  the company s customers sometimes purchase greater quantities of product to expand their inventories to protect against further pricing increases 
this enables the company to sell greater quantities of products that are sensitive to inflationary pressures 
however  inflationary pressures frequently increase interest rates 
since the company is dependent on financing  any increase in interest rates will increase the company s credit costs  thereby reducing its profits
