index to financial statements in july  we formed a new business venture with ag tech corporation  a company developing  selling and importing packaged software  to sell and support our products in japan 
ag tech has been engaged in the sales and support of btrieve predecessor to pervasive 
sql and pervasive 
sql products since in conjunction with the joint venture  ag tech launched a new operating division staffed with specialists experienced in selling and supporting pervasive 
sql to assume responsibility for oem sales  packaged software sales  technical support and localization and translation of our products into japanese 
the new business venture has resulted in improved profitability on sales in japan as the arrangement allowed us to significantly reduce our costs in japan 
in connection with the new business venture  we obtained a less than ownership interest in ag tech and the ability to elect one director to the ag tech board of directors 
we do not have the ability to significantly influence or control the operations of ag tech and therefore account for our investment in ag tech on the cost method of accounting 
pervasive s revenues from japan were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
in june  we renewed portions of our distribution agreement with ag tech for an additional three year period ending june  critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies revenue recognition sales returns and bad debt reserves goodwill and other intangible assets stock based compensation expense taxes revenue recognition we license our software through oem license agreements with software developers  or isvs  and through shrink wrap software licenses  sold through isvs  value added resellers  or vars  systems integrators and distributors  or direct to end users 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenues related to oem license agreements involving nonrefundable fixed minimum license fees are generally recognized upon delivery of the product master or first copy if no significant vendor obligations remain 
per copy royalties related to oem license agreements in excess of a fixed minimum amount are recognized as revenue when such amounts are reported to us 
revenue from post contract support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades is recognized ratably over the contract term 
we generally provide telephone support to customers and end users in the days immediately following the sale at no additional charge and at a minimal cost per call 
we accrue the cost of providing this support 
revenue from consulting services and training is recognized when the related services are performed 
we enter into agreements with certain distributors that provide for certain stock rotation and price protection rights 
these rights allow the distributor to return products in a non cash exchange for other products or for credits against future purchases 
revenue from shipping and handling is recognized at the shipping date 
shipping and handling costs are included in costs of product license revenues in the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents 
index to financial statements where software licenses are sold with maintenance or other services  we allocate the total fee to the various elements based on the fair values of the elements 
we determine the fair value of each element in the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate 
if we do not have vsoe for one of the delivered elements of an arrangement  but do have vsoe for all undelivered elements  we use the residual method to record revenue 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is first allocated to the undelivered elements based upon their vsoe of fair value  the remaining arrangement fee  including any discount  is allocated to the delivered element 
if the residual method is not used  discounts  if any  are applied proportionately to each element included in the arrangement based on each element s fair value without regard to the discount 
sales returns and bad debt reserves we reserve for the cost of estimated sales returns  stock rotation and price protection rights as well as uncollectible accounts based on experience 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns  stock rotation and price protection 
because these reserves are based on our judgments and estimates  our reserves may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net sales could be adversely affected 
goodwill and other intangible assets we assess whether goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are impaired on an annual basis 
upon determining the existence of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles impairment  we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles exceeds its fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstance that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangibles has been impaired 
stock based compensation expense we account for employee stock based compensation costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r and staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock based compensation at the date of grant  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected life 
historical volatility was used in estimating the fair value of our stock based awards rather than implied volatility  while the expected life was estimated to be four years based on historical trends since our initial public offering 
further  as required under sfas r  we now estimate forfeitures for options granted  which are not expected to vest 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
the estimated fair value is charged to earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards  which is generally four years 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options having no vesting restrictions and being fully transferable 
accordingly  our estimate of fair value may not represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction 
while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially impacts our results of operations  it has no impact on our cash position 
taxes under the asset and liability method of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax 
table of contents 
index to financial statements exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
we concluded that a valuation allowance was required for all periods presented 
we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  and we were able to determine that we expect to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  resulting in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in the amount of million  increasing our income in the current period 
pursuant to the internal revenue code  the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
events which cause limitations in the amount of net operating losses and tax credits that we may utilize include  but are not limited to  a cumulative change of more than ownership of the company  as defined  over a three year period  and changes in the relative mix of our foreign source taxable income versus our domestic taxable income 
further  our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to potential expiration if not utilized by certain dates in the future 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are frequently under audit by tax authorities in various jurisdictions 
accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
although we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we have recorded a liability for our best estimate of the probable loss on certain of these positions 
we believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years  based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter  which matters result primarily from intercompany transfer pricing 
although we believe our recorded assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax regulations are subject to interpretation and tax litigation is inherently uncertain  therefore our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
based on the results of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
due to the complexity involved we are not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded

sql  decreased in fiscal year  relative to the fiscal year we believe this decrease was due to a variety of factors  including but not limited to  increasing competition and what we believe to be the increasingly negative impact of general economic conditions on our isv customers who build applications utilizing our database software and reduced demand for the isvs software applications themselves 
our embedded database and related products represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year in addition  we believe the integration products we acquired in fiscal year as a result of our acquisition of data junction corporation represent a growth opportunity as we invest in revenue synergies and opportunities presented by the acquired business  combined with our historical database business and channels 
our integration products represented approximately of our revenue in fiscal year a continued reduction in our embedded database business  or our inability to grow our integration products business  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition

sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to a reduction in costs related to sales and marketing personnel  offset partially by stock based compensation expense related to the requirement to record stock based compensation expense under fas r beginning on july  we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will show further decline during fiscal year based on current expense run rates

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation defines the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on disclosures in our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  we do have foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
currently  we have operations in japan  belgium  germany  france and england and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in revenue and operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been a decrease in revenue and operating income of less than million 
if the us dollar to japanese yen rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in revenue and operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in operating income of approximately million 
if the us dollar to euro rate had remained unchanged throughout fiscal  the result would have been an increase in operating income of less than million 
the impact of fluctuations in the relative value of all other currencies for fiscal  and was not material 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure and  from time to time  will attempt to reduce exposure through hedging 
gains and losses on foreign currency hedging were not material to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended june   and as such hedging activities were minimal 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our cash and marketable securities investments  however  this risk is limited as our investment policy requires us to invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less
