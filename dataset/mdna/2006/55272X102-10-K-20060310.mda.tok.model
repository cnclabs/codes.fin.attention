item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general mfa mortgage investments  inc  a self advised mortgage reit  is primarily engaged in the business of investing  on a leveraged basis  in arm mbs 
the company s mbs portfolio consists primarily of agency mbs and  to a lesser extent  high quality arm mbs  rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least one of the rating agencies 
the company s operating policies also permit investments in residential mortgage loans  residential mbs  direct or indirect investments in multi family apartment properties  investments in limited partnerships  reits or closed end funds and investments in other corporate or government fixed income instruments 
the company s principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to its stockholders resulting from the spread between the interest and other income it earns on its investments and the interest expense on its borrowings used to finance such investments and its operating costs 
the company has elected to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 
one of the requirements of maintaining its qualification as a reit is that the company must distribute at least of its annual taxable net income to its stockholders  subject to certain adjustments 
in general  the company has  over time  significantly increased its asset base by investing  on a leveraged basis  additional equity capital raised through public offerings and other issuances of common stock 
however  during  the company reduced its asset base through a strategy under which it  among other things  determined not to fully reinvest principal repayments on its arm mbs as the underlying arms on such assets were prepaid  repositioned its portfolio through sales of select arm mbs and repurchased shares of its common stock 
in response to the continued rising interest rate environment and relatively flat yield curve in  the company realigned its balance sheet to better position the company for the future 
the company s total assets were billion at december   compared to billion at december  at december   of the company s assets consisted of agency mbs  aaa rated mbs  mbs related receivables and cash 
at december   the company also had indirect interests in three multi family apartment properties  containing a total of rental units  located in georgia  north carolina and nebraska  and million of non agency mbs rated below aaa 
the results of the company s business operations are affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond its control  and primarily depend on  among other things  the level of its net interest income  the market value of its assets and the supply of  and demand for  mbs in the market place 
the company s net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  the slope of the yield curve  borrowing costs ie  interest expense and prepayment speeds on our mbs portfolio  the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties 
interest rates and prepayment speeds  as measured by the cpr  vary according to the type of investment  conditions in the financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
with respect to the company s business operations  increases in interest rates  in general  may over time cause i the interest expense associated with its borrowings ie  repurchase agreements to increase  ii the value of its mbs portfolio and  correspondingly  its stockholders equity to decline  iii prepayments on its mbs portfolio to slow  thereby reducing the cost of premium amortization  and iv coupons on its mbs to reset  although on a delayed basis  to higher interest rates 
conversely  decreases in interest rates  in general  may over time cause i prepayments on its mbs portfolio to increase  thereby increasing the cost of premium amortization  ii coupons on its mbs assets to reset  although on a delayed basis  to lower interest rates  iii the interest expense associated with its borrowings to decrease  and iv the value of its mbs portfolio and  correspondingly  its stockholders equity to increase 
in addition  borrowing costs and credit lines are further affected by our perceived credit worthiness 
the consecutive increases in the target federal funds rate from to as of january  are expected to continue to increase the cost of the company s liabilities at a more rapid pace than the yield on its assets  negatively impacting spreads in this is due to the fact that interest rates on the company s existing liabilities reset on average approximately every four months while interest rates on its assets  in general  reset every months and  with respect of its hybrid mbs  only after an initial fixed rate period 
as a result  the company anticipates that it will experience a period of reduced earnings over the next several quarters 
the company believes that there is a strong probability of one or more additional increases in the target federal funds rate in  which could have a further negative impact on spreads and earnings in in addition  due to the shape of the yield curve which has recently been flat and even inverted  cash out refinancing opportunities and the availability of lower monthly payment interest only mortgages  the company s prepayment rates may be elevated  further negatively impacting spreads and income 
over the past five years  mfa s quarterly net spreads have averaged  varying from a low of  which was experienced during the quarter ended september   to a high of in the fourth quarter of since the second quarter of  the differential between short term and long term benchmark interest rates has narrowed significantly ie  a flattening of the yield curve 
in addition to the rising short term interest rate environment  this trend has  and is expected to continue to  negatively impact the company s net interest income  interest rate spread and net interest margin  key determinants of the company s net income 
the following table presents the quarterly average of certain benchmark interest rates for the two years ended december  quarter ended day libor month libor month libor year cmt year treasury year treasury december september june march december september june march cmt constant maturity treasury 
the company  through wholly owned subsidiaries  provides third party investment advisory services for which it generates fee income 
in addition  the company continues to explore alternative business strategies  investments and financing sources and other strategic initiatives  including  without limitation  the acquisition and securitization of arms  the expansion of third party advisory services  the creation of new company managed investment vehicles and the creation and or acquisition of a third party asset management business to complement the company s core business strategy of investing  on a leveraged basis  in high quality arm mbs 
no assurance  however  can be provided that any such strategic initiatives will or will not be implemented in the future or  if undertaken  that any such strategic initiatives will favorably impact the company 
the company believes that the cpr in future periods will depend  in part  on changes in and the level of market interest rates across the yield curve  with higher cprs expected during periods of declining interest rates and lower cprs expected during periods of rising interest rates 
the company s weighted average contractual maturities on repurchase agreements was months at december   compared to months at december   however  the company s swaps in effect extended the fixed pricing period on the company s repurchase agreements to months at december  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for  the company realized a net loss on its common stock of million  or per share  compared to net income available to common stockholders of million  or per share  for given the continued rising interest rate environment  the company repositioned a portion of its mbs portfolio 
this repositioning resulted in the company recognizing an aggregate loss of million in the fourth quarter of  comprised of an million loss on the sale of mbs and an impairment charge of million against certain mbs retained in the portfolio at december  in addition  as a result of the rising interest rate environment and flattening of the yield curve  the net interest spread and margin compression experienced by the company during continued during  as the cost of its borrowings continued to increase more rapidly than did the yield on its mbs portfolio 
the company believes that when the yield curve is relatively flat  borrowers have an incentive to refinance into hybrid mortgages with longer initial fixed rate periods or fixed rate products 
further  the availability of alternative mortgage products  an efficient refinancing market and a cycle of rising property values that has promoted cash out refinancing contributed to the cpr remaining elevated 
the impact of such adverse market conditions on each component of the company s net income available to common stockholders is further detailed below 
interest income for increased by million  or  to million from million for this increase in interest income primarily reflects growth in the company s average mbs portfolio  which was funded through the investment  on a leveraged basis  of equity capital raised during and  to a lesser extent  the first quarter of the company s average investment in mbs excluding changes in market values increased by billion  or  to billion for from billion for the net yield on the mbs portfolio increased to for from for  primarily reflecting an increase in the gross coupon ie  average stated interest rate to from for the cost of premium amortization  which is driven by the cpr  remained high at basis points for  compared to basis points for high refinancing activity  as reflected by the cpr  experienced on the mbs portfolio during and  caused amortization of purchase premiums to remain elevated during the following table presents the components of the net yield earned on the company s mbs portfolio for the quarterly periods presented quarter ended stated coupon cost of premium net premium amortization cost of delay for principal receivable net yield december september june march december september june march the following table presents the quarterly average cpr experienced on the company s mbs portfolio  on an annualized basis quarter ended cpr december september june march december september june march interest income from short term cash investments ie  money market sweep accounts increased by million  to million for  from  for this increase reflects the combined impact of a million increase in the average cash investments held during compared to together with an increase in the yield on cash investments reflecting the rising interest rate environment to for  from for in general  the company manages its cash investments relative to its  financing and operating requirements and investment opportunities 
interest expense for increased by to million  from million for  while the average balance of repurchase agreements for increased by to billion  from billion for the increase in borrowings reflects the leveraging of additional equity capital raised during the latter part of and  to a lesser extent  the earlier part of the company s cost of borrowings  which is net of costs on its hedging instruments  increased to for  compared to for the net cost of the company s hedging instruments decreased to million  or two basis points  to the cost of borrowings for  from million  or six basis points  for the company s hedging instruments may result in interest expense or a reduction to interest expense depending on the rates specified in such instruments relative to each instrument s benchmark market rate 
see notes l and to the consolidated financial statements  included under item of this annual report on form k 
the us federal reserve has raised the federal funds rate from at june  to at december   and the company expects that the recent and anticipated increases in market interest rates will cause the company s cost of funding to continue to increase in for  the company s net interest income decreased by million  to million  from million for reflecting the negative impact of rising interest rates  a flattening of the yield curve and high prepayment speeds 
these factors all contributed to a compression of the company s net interest margin and spread 
the net yield on interest earning assets increased by basis points during from while the cost of borrowings increased by basis points over the prior year 
the company s resulting net interest spread and net interest margins decreased to and  respectively  for  compared to and  respectively  for for the years ended december  and  the company had total average assets of billion and billion  respectively

while the company generally continues to intend to hold its mbs as long term investments  certain mbs have historically and will continue to be sold as part of managing the company s interest rate risk  liquidity needs and other operating objectives 
during the fourth quarter of  the company repositioned its mbs portfolio in response to the adverse interest rate environment 
as a result  the company incurred a fourth quarter loss of million realized upon the sale of mbs with an amortized cost of million and an impairment charge of million taken against mbs with an amortized cost of million 
the loss on sale and the impairment charge reflect the company s strategic reassessment of its portfolio 
the company recognized the impairment charge against impaired mbs that it determined to be other than temporarily impaired  as it no longer intended to continue to hold such mbs until full recovery of impaired market value 
all impairment on the mbs was related to changes in interest rates  as all of the mbs sold or identified as other than temporarily impaired were either agency mbs or rated aaa 
the impairment charge  which reflects the difference between the amortized cost of mbs considered to be other than temporarily impaired and their estimated market value at december   reflects the company s early application of the financial accounting standards board fasb staff position the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments released by the fasb on november  because the company s mbs portfolio is designated as available for sale  the impairment on such mbs was previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
upon identifying certain mbs as other than temporarily impaired  the company recognized the impairment through earnings 
the mbs identified as other than temporarily impaired remained in the company s portfolio at december   carried at a new cost basis equal to their fair value at december   future gains losses on such mbs will be realized upon their ultimate sale or prepayment 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements  included under item of this annual report on form k 
as part of the overall portfolio management  the company assesses its mbs on a regular basis  and not less than quarterly  for other than temporary impairment 
future impairments will be recognized if it is later determined that impairment on mbs is considered to be other than temporary 
during  the company sold mbs with an amortized cost of million  resulting in gains of  the timing and impact of future sales of mbs  if any  cannot be predicted with any certainty

during the fourth quarter of  the company reconsidered its position of holding the greenhouse for investment purposes and determined that it would consider the sale of such property 
the company subsequently entered into a letter of intent for the sale of the greenhouse and expects such sale to result in a gain of approximately million during the first quarter of the remaining two real estate interests are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations

critical accounting policies management has the obligation to ensure that its policies and methodologies are in accordance with gaap 
during  management reviewed and evaluated its critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe that there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company s accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  included under item of this annual report on form k 
management believes the more significant of these to be as follows classifications of investment securities and valuations of such securities the company s investments in mbs are classified as available for sale securities  as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements  included under item of this annual report on form k 
although all of the company s mbs are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value  the classification of the securities as available for sale results in changes in estimated fair value being recorded as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  which is a component of stockholders equity  rather than through earnings 
the company does not intend to hold any of its securities for trading purposes  however  if available for sale securities were classified as trading securities  there could be substantially greater volatility in the company s earnings 
as noted above  all of the company s mbs are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value 
the estimated fair values of such assets are based on prices obtained from a third party pricing service  if pricing is not available for an mbs from such pricing service  the average of broker quotes received for such mbs is used to determine the estimated fair value of such mbs 
given that such securities trade in an active market  the company believes that the fair market values presented accurately reflect the estimated fair market value of the mbs at the time of valuation 
when the estimated fair value of an available for sale security is less than amortized cost  management considers whether there is an other than temporary impairment in the value of the security 
if  in management s judgment  an other than temporary impairment exists  the cost basis of the security is written down to the then current estimated fair value  with the amount of impairment charged to current earnings 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective on going process  and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing of loss realization

interest income recognition interest income on the company s mbs is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal balance of such securities 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method  as adjusted for actual prepayments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas no

derivative financial instruments and hedging activities the company applies the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  fas as amended by fas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
in accordance with fas  a derivative  which is designated as a hedge  is recognized as an asset liability and measured at estimated fair value 
to qualify for hedge accounting  the company must  at inception of a hedge  anticipate that the hedge will be highly effective 
as long as the hedge remains effective  changes in the estimated fair value of the hedging instrument are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
for cap agreements  upon commencement of the active period and throughout the active period  the premium paid to enter into the cap agreement is amortized and reflected in interest expense 
the periodic amortization of the premium on a cap agreement is based on an estimated allocation of the premium  determined at inception of the hedge based on the original purchase price 
if it is determined that a cap agreement is not effective  the premium would be reduced and a corresponding charge made to interest expense  for the ineffective portion of the cap agreement 
the maximum cost related to the company s cap agreements is limited to the original purchase price of the derivative 
no premium is paid to enter into swaps 
payments received on the company s hedging instruments  if any  offset interest expense on the hedged liabilities 
in order to continue to qualify for and to apply hedge accounting  the company s cap agreements and swaps are monitored on a quarterly basis to determine whether they continue to be effective or  if prior to the commencement of the active period  whether the hedge is expected to continue to be effective 
if during the term of a hedging instrument the company determines that the hedge is not effective or that the hedge is not expected to be effective  the ineffective portion of the hedge will no longer qualify for hedge accounting and  accordingly  subsequent changes in its estimated fair value will be reflected in earnings 
at december   the company had five cap agreements  with an aggregate notional amount of million  with unrealized gains of  and five swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million with unrealized gains of million 
the company had no unrealized losses on its hedging instruments

income taxes the company s financial results generally do not reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that the company has and intends to continue to operate in a manner that will continue to allow it to be taxed as a reit and as a result does not expect to pay substantial corporate level taxes 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if the company were to fail to meet the reit requirements  the company would be subject to us federal  state and local income taxes 
accounting for stock based compensation on january   the company adopted fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by fas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas 
the adoption of fas did not have an impact on the company as all outstanding stock options were fully vested at the time fas was adopted 
however  the company recorded an expense of  and  for and  respectively  with respect to its stock options and related dividend equivalent rights ders granted subsequent to january  the future effect of fas  as amended by fas r  will be based on  among other things  the underlying terms of any future grants of stock based compensation

the company currently records the acquisition of these mbs as assets and the related financings under repurchase agreements as liabilities gross on its consolidated statements of financial condition  with changes in the fair value of these mbs being recorded in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
the corresponding interest income earned on these mbs and interest expense incurred on the related repurchase agreements are reported gross on the company s consolidated statements of income 
as of december  and  the company had and same party transactions aggregating approximately million and billion  respectively  in mbs and million and billion  respectively  in financings under related repurchase agreements 
as of march   the company had one remaining same party transaction comprised of million of mbs with a related financing under a repurchase agreement of million  it is anticipated that such transaction will no longer be a same party transaction as of march however  based upon the company s understanding of a technical interpretation of the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities fas  same party transactions may not qualify as a purchase by the company because the mbs purchased by the company in same party transactions may not be determined to be legally isolated from the counterparty to such transactions 
the result of this technical interpretation would be to preclude the company from presenting i these mbs and the related financings under repurchase agreements on a gross basis on its consolidated statements of financial condition and ii the related interest income earned and interest expense incurred on a gross basis on its consolidated statements of income 
instead  the company would be required to present same party transactions on a net basis as derivatives and report the corresponding change in fair value of such derivatives on its consolidated statements of income 
the derivatives created by these types of transactions would reflect the changes in the value of the underlying mbs and the changes in the value of the underlying financings provided by the applicable counterparty 
if the company were to determine it was required to apply this technical interpretation of fas  the potential change in its accounting treatment would not affect the economics of the same party transactions  but would affect how these transactions were reported on its consolidated financial statements 
the company is in the process of determining the impact of same party transactions on its financial statements for the years ended december   and under the net method 
the company believes that its cash flows  liquidity and ability to pay dividend distributions would be unchanged and that its taxable income would not be affected 
although the company believes its accounting for same party transactions is appropriate  it will continue to evaluate such position as the interpretation of this issue among industry participants and standard setters evolves 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements  principal payments received on its portfolio of mbs  cash flows generated by operations and proceeds from capital market transactions 
the company s most significant uses of cash include purchases of mbs  dividend payments on its capital stock and repayments of principal and interest on its repurchase agreements 
in addition  the company also uses cash to fund operations  enter into hedging instruments  repurchase shares of its common stock pursuant to the repurchase program  and make such other investments that it considers appropriate 
borrowings under repurchase agreements decreased by billion to billion at december   from billion at december  at december   repurchase agreements had a weighted average borrowing rate of  on loan balances of between  and million 
these repurchase agreements generally have original terms to maturity ranging from one to months at inception of the loan and fixed interest rates that are typically based off of libor 
through december   the company had satisfied all of its margin calls 
during the year ended december   principal payments on mbs generated cash of billion and operations provided million in cash 
as part of its core investing activities  during  the company purchased billion of mbs  all of which were either agency mbs or aaa rated arm mbs 
during the year ended december   the company paid dividends on its outstanding common stock and preferred stock totaling million 
on december   the company declared dividends on it common stock totaling million  which were paid on january  to stockholders of record on december  the company used million to repurchase approximately million shares of its common stock from inception of repurchase program  in august  through december  while the company generally intends to hold its mbs as long term investments  certain mbs may be sold as part of managing the company s interest rate risk  liquidity needs and other operating objectives 
as such  all of the company s mbs are designated as available for sale 
the timing and impact of future sales of mbs  if any  cannot be predicted with any certainty 
during the year ended december   the company  as part of the realignment of its portfolio  sold mbs with an aggregate amortized cost of million  realizing net losses of million and generating cash proceeds of million 
the company does not intend for its mbs portfolio  or any portion thereof  to be held for trading purposes 
at december   the company had an aggregate of million available under its two effective shelf registration statements on form s the company may  as market conditions permit  issue additional shares of common stock and or preferred stock pursuant to these registration statements 
in addition  the company had an effective shelf registration in order to offer for sale additional common stock through the drspp 
at december   million shares of common stock remained available for issuance pursuant to the drspp shelf registration 
to the extent the company raises additional equity capital from future capital market transactions  the company currently anticipates using the net proceeds for general corporate purposes  including  without limitation  the acquisition of additional mbs consistent with its operating policies and the repayment of its repurchase agreements 
the company may also consider acquiring additional interests in residential arms  multi family apartment properties and or other investments consistent with its investment strategies and operating policies 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to raise additional equity capital at any particular time or on any particular terms 
in order to reduce interest rate risk exposure  the company may enter into caps and swaps 
during the year ended december   the company did not purchase any caps  entered into million notional amount of fixed rate pay swaps and had million of caps that expired 
the company s caps  which had an aggregate notional amount of million at december   will generate future cash payments to the company if interest rates were to increase beyond the rate specified in any of the individual cap agreements 
during the year ended december   the company received or was due payments of  on its caps 
at december   the company had swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million and maturities extending through february  pursuant to the swaps outstanding at december   the company was required to pay a weighted average fixed rate of and receive a variable rate based on day libor 
under its repurchase agreements  the company may be required to pledge additional assets to its repurchase agreement counterparties ie  lenders in the event the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders demand additional collateral ie  a margin call  which may take the form of additional securities or cash 
specifically  margin calls result from a decline in the value of the company s mbs collateralizing its repurchase agreements  generally due to principal reduction of such mbs from scheduled amortization and prepayments on the mortgages securing such mbs and to changes in the estimated fair value of such mbs resulting from changes in market interest rates and other market factors 
from time to time  the company may have restricted cash which represents cash held on deposit as collateral with lenders and  at the time a repurchase agreement rolls ie  matures  generally will be applied against the repurchase agreement  thereby reducing the borrowing 
the company believes it has adequate financial resources to meet its obligations as they come due  including margin calls  and to fund dividends declared as well as to actively pursue its investment strategies 
through december   the company had satisfied all of its margin calls 
however  should market interest rates and or prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying the company s mbs suddenly increase  margin calls on the company s repurchase agreements could result  causing an adverse change in the company s liquidity position 
the following table summarizes the effect on the company s liquidity and cash flows from contractual obligations for repurchase agreements  non cancelable office leases and mortgages on properties held by the company s real estate subsidiaries at december  thereafter in thousands repurchase agreements   mortgage loans   long term lease obligations includes a million mortgage on the greenhouse  which was satisfied on january   upon the sale of such property

inflation substantially all of the company s assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates and other factors impact the company s performance far more than does inflation 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and dividends are based upon net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  the company s results of operations and reported assets  liabilities and equity are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation

see item a  risk factors of this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial institutions in a prudent manner designed to insure the longevity of the company while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive total rates of return through stock ownership of the company 
while the company does not seek to avoid risk  it does seek to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risk  to earn sufficient returns to justify the taking of such risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks that it does undertake 
interest rate risk the company primarily invests in arm mbs 
the company expects that over time its arm mbs will experience higher prepayment rates than would fixed rate mbs 
this is based on the assumption that homeowners with adjustable rate and hybrid mortgages are generally self selected borrowers and are expected to exhibit more rapid housing turnover levels or refinancing activity compared to fixed rate borrowers 
in addition  the company believes that prepayments on arm mbs accelerate significantly as the coupon reset date approaches 
over the last two years  on a quarterly basis  ending with december   the monthly cpr on the company s mbs portfolio ranged from a low of to a high of  with an average quarterly cpr of 
the company takes into account both anticipated coupon resets and expected prepayments when measuring sensitivity of its arm mbs portfolio to changes in interest rates 
in measuring its assets to borrowings repricing gap the repricing gap  the company measures the difference between a the weighted average months until coupon adjustment or projected prepayment on the arm mbs portfolio  and b the months remaining on its repurchase agreements applying the same projected prepayment rate and including the impact of swaps 
assuming a cpr  the weighted average term to repricing or assumed prepayment for the company s arm mbs portfolio  as of december   was approximately months and the average term remaining on the company s repurchase agreements  including the impact of swaps  was approximately four months  resulting in repricing gap of eight months 
assuming prepayment rates were to decline significantly to a prepayment rate as low as cpr  the weighted average term to repricing or assumed prepayment for the company s arm mbs portfolio  as of december   would be extended to approximately months and the average term remaining on the company s repurchase agreements  including the impact of swaps  would remain at approximately four months  resulting in an extension of the repricing gap to approximately ten months 
the cpr is applied in order to reflect  to a certain extent  the prepayment characteristics inherent in the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
as of december   based on contractual terms ie  assuming no prepayments  the company s arm mbs portfolio had a weighted average term to repricing of approximately months and its repurchase agreements  including the impact of swaps  had a weighted average term remaining of approximately four months  resulting in a repricing gap of approximately months 
based on historical results  the company believes that applying a cpr assumption  rather than a cpr assumption  provides a more realistic approximation of the repricing gap for the company s arm mbs portfolio over time 
the company s debt obligations are generally repurchase agreements with remaining terms of two years or less 
upon contractual maturity or an interest reset date  these borrowings are refinanced at then prevailing market rates 
the interest rates for most of the company s adjustable rate assets are primarily dependent on the one year cmt rate  libor  or mta  while its debt obligations  in the form of repurchase agreements  are generally priced off of libor 
while libor and cmt generally move together  there can be no assurance that such movements will be parallel  such that the magnitude of the movement of one index will match that of the other index 
at december   the company had of its arm mbs portfolio repricing from the one year cmt index  repricing from the one year libor index  repricing from mta and repricing from cofi 
the company s adjustable rate assets reset on various dates that are not matched to the reset dates on the company s borrowings ie  repurchase agreements 
in general  the repricing of the company s debt obligations occurs more quickly than the repricing of its assets 
therefore  on average  the company s cost of borrowings may rise or fall more quickly in response to changes in market interest rates than does the yield on its interest earning assets 
the mismatch between repricings or maturities within a time period is commonly referred to as the gap for that period 
a positive gap  where repricing of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the maturity of interest rate sensitive liabilities  generally will result in the net interest margin increasing in a rising interest rate environment and decreasing in a falling interest rate environment 
at december   the company had a negative gap  which will generally have the opposite results on the net interest margin 
as discussed above  the gap analysis is prepared assuming cprs of and  however  actual prepayment speeds could vary significantly 
the gap analysis does not reflect the constraints on the repricing of arm mbs in a given period resulting from interim and lifetime cap features on these securities  or the behavior of various indexes applicable to the company s assets and liabilities 
the gap methodology does not assess the relative sensitivity of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates and also fails to account for interest rate caps and floors imbedded in the company s mbs or include assets and liabilities that are not interest rate sensitive 
the following table sets forth the company s interest rate risk using the gap methodology applying a cpr at december  at december  less than three months to one year to two years to beyond three months one year two years three years years total interest earning assets adjustable rate mbs     fixed rate mbs   cash   total interest earning assets    interest bearing liabilities repurchase agreements    mortgage loans   total interest bearing liabilities   gap before hedging instruments    notional amounts of swaps  cumulative difference between interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities after hedging instruments  as part of its overall interest rate risk management strategy  the company periodically uses hedging instruments to mitigate the impact of significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
the interest rate risk management strategy at times involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities utilizing derivatives 
at december   the company had caps with an aggregate notional amount of million and swaps with a notional amount of million  all of which are active 
during the year ended december   the company received or was due payments of  from counterparties on its caps and  related to its swaps 
the notional amount of the swap is presented in the table above  as it impacts the cost of a portion of the company s repurchase agreements 
the notional amounts of the company s caps  which hedge against increases in interest rates on the company s libor based repurchase agreements  are not considered in the gap analysis  as they do not effect the timing of the repricing of the instruments they hedge  but rather  to the extent of the notional amount  cap the limit on the amount of interest rate change that can occur relative to the hedged liability 
in addition  the notional amounts of the company s hedging instruments are not reflected in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
the company s caps  at the time of purchase  are intended to serve as a hedge against future interest rate increases on the company s repurchase agreements  which are typically priced off of libor 
market value risk substantially all of the company s mbs are designated as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at their estimated fair value  with the difference between amortized cost and estimated fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  included under item of this annual report on form k 
the estimated fair value of the company s mbs fluctuate primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors  however  given that  at december   these securities were primarily agency mbs or aaa rated mbs  such changes in the estimated fair value of the company s mbs are generally not credit related 
to a limited extent the company is exposed to credit related market value risk as the company at  december   held million of non agency mbs that were rated below aaa  of which  were non rated securities 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of the company s mbs would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of such mbs would be expected to increase 
if the estimated fair value of the company s mbs collateralizing its repurchase agreements decreases  the company may receive margin calls from its repurchase agreement counterparties for additional collateral or cash due to such decline 
if such margin calls were not met  the lender could liquidate the securities collateralizing the company s repurchase agreements with such lender  resulting in a loss to the company 
in such a scenario  the company could apply a strategy of reducing borrowings and assets  by selling assets or not replacing securities as they amortize and or prepay  thereby shrinking the balance sheet 
such an action would likely reduce interest income  interest expense and net income  the extent of which would be dependent on the level of reduction in assets and liabilities as well as the sale price of the assets sold 
further  such a decrease in the company s net interest income could negatively impact cash available for distributions  which in turn could reduce the market price of the company s issued and outstanding common stock and preferred stock 
liquidity risk the primary liquidity risk for the company arises from financing long maturity assets  which have interim and lifetime interest rate adjustment caps  with shorter term borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements 
although the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities are matched within the guidelines established by the company s operating policies  maturities are not required to be nor are they matched 
the company s assets which are pledged to secure repurchase agreements are typically high quality  liquid assets 
as a result  the company has not had difficulty rolling over ie  renewing these agreements as they mature 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will always be able to roll over its repurchase agreements 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million and unpledged securities of million available to meet margin calls on its repurchase agreements and for other corporate purposes 
however  should market interest rates and or prepayment speeds on the mortgage loans underlying the company s mbs suddenly increase  margin calls relating to the company s repurchase agreements could increase  causing an adverse change in the company s liquidity position 
prepayment and reinvestment risk as the company receives repayments of principal on its mbs  premiums paid on such securities are amortized against interest income and discounts on mbs are accreted to interest income 
premiums arise when the company acquires a mbs at a price in excess of the principal balance of the mortgages securing such mbs or the par value of such mbs if purchased at the original issue 
conversely  discounts arise when the company acquires a mbs at a price below the principal balance of the mortgages securing such mbs or the par value of such mbs if purchased at the original issue 
for financial accounting purposes interest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal balance of the investment securities and their contractual terms 
purchase premiums on the company s investment securities  currently comprised of mbs  are amortized against interest income over the lives of the securities using the effective yield method  adjusted for actual prepayment activity 
in general  an increase in the prepayment rate  as measured by the cpr  will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the yield interest income earned on such assets 
for tax accounting purposes  the purchase premiums and discounts are amortized based on the constant effective yield at the purchase date 
therefore  on a tax basis  amortization of premiums and discounts will differ from those reported for financial purposes under gaap 
at december   the gross premium for arm mbs for financial accounting purposes was million of the carrying value of mbs and the gross discount was million  while the gross premium for income tax purposes was estimated at million and the gross discount was estimated at  see note b to the consolidated financial statements  included under item of this annual report on form k 
in general  the company believes that it will be able to reinvest proceeds from scheduled principal payments and prepayments at acceptable yields  however  no assurances can be given that  should significant prepayments occur  market conditions would be such that acceptable investments could be identified and the proceeds timely reinvested 
tabular presentation the information presented in the following table projects the potential impact of sudden parallel changes in interest rates on net interest income and portfolio value  including the impact of hedging instruments  over the next twelve months based on the assets in the company s investment portfolio on december  the company acquires interest rate sensitive assets and funds them with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
while the company generally retains such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity  the realignment of the mbs portfolio during the fourth quarter of and its anticipated impact is reflected in the accompanying table 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage change from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
change in interest rates percentage change in net interest income percentage change in portfolio value certain assumptions have been made in connection with the calculation of the information set forth in the above table and  as such  there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  the analysis presented utilizes assumptions and estimates based on management s judgment and experience 
furthermore  future purchases and sales of assets  could materially change the company s interest rate risk profile 
it should be specifically noted that the information set forth in the above table and all related disclosure constitutes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the act and section e of the exchange act 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
the table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value should interest rates immediately change shock 
the table presents the estimated impact of interest rates instantaneously rising and basis points  and falling and basis points 
the cash flows associated with the portfolio of mbs for each rate shock are calculated based on assumptions  including  but not limited to  prepayment speeds  yield on future acquisitions  slope of the yield curve and size of the portfolio 
assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities  which are assumed to be repurchase agreements  include anticipated interest rates  collateral requirements as a percent of the repurchase agreement  amount and term of borrowing 
the impact on portfolio value is approximated using the calculated effective duration ie  the price sensitivity to changes in interest rates of and expected convexity ie  the approximate change in duration relative to the change in interest rates of 
the impact on net interest income is driven mainly by the difference between portfolio yield and cost of funding of the company s repurchase agreements  which includes the cost and or benefit from hedging instruments that hedge such repurchase agreements 
the company s asset liability structure is generally such that an increase in interest rates would be expected to result in a decrease in net interest income  as the company s repurchase agreements are generally shorter term than the company s interest earning assets 
when interest rates are shocked  prepayment assumptions are adjusted based on management s expectations along with the results from the prepayment model 
for example  under current market conditions  a basis point increase in interest rates is estimated to result in a decrease in the cpr of the mbs portfolio
