table of contents waste to energy projects the fundamental purpose of covanta energy s waste to energy projects is to provide waste disposal services  typically to municipal clients who sponsor the projects 
generally  covanta energy provides these services pursuant to long term service contracts 
the electricity or steam generated is generally sold pursuant to long term power purchase agreements with local utilities or industrial customers  and most of the resulting revenues reduce the overall cost of waste disposal services to the municipal clients 
the original terms of the service contracts are each or more years  with the majority now in the second half of their respective terms 
many of covanta energy s service contracts may be renewed for varying periods of time  at the option of the municipal client 
covanta energy receives its revenue in the form of fees pursuant to the service or waste contracts  and in some cases  energy purchase agreements  at facilities it owns or operates 
transriver  one of covanta energy s subsidiaries  markets waste disposal services to third parties predominantly to efficiently utilize that portion of the waste disposal capacity of covanta energy s projects which is not dedicated to municipal clients under such long term service contracts 
covanta energy currently operates waste to energy projects in states  identified below under domestic project summaries 
most of covanta energy s operating waste to energy projects were developed and structured contractually as part of competitive procurement processes conducted by municipal entities 
as a result  many of these projects have common features 
however  each service agreement is different to reflect the specific needs and concerns of a client community  applicable regulatory requirements and other factors 
the following describes features generally common to these agreements  as well as important distinctions among them covanta energy designs the facility  helps to arrange for financing and then either constructs and equips the facility on a fixed price and schedule basis  or undertakes an alternative role  such as construction management  if that better meets the goals of the municipal client 
following construction and during operations  covanta energy receives revenue from two primary sources from fees it charges for operating projects or for processing waste received  and from payments for electricity and or steam sales 
covanta energy has twenty three waste to energy projects at which it charges a fixed fee which escalates over time pursuant to contractual indices for its operation and maintenance services  referred to herein as having a service fee structure 
covanta energy also has waste to energy projects at which it charges a per ton fee under contracts for processing waste  referred to herein as having a tip fee structure 
at its tip fee projects  covanta energy contracts on both a long term and short term basis to utilize project disposal capacity  and as such generally has a greater exposure to waste market price fluctuation  as well as a greater exposure to project operating disruptions that may cause it to reduce waste acceptance 
the energy output from covanta energy s projects is generally sold pursuant to long term contracts to local utilities 
where a service fee structure exists  covanta energy s client community usually retains a portion generally of the energy revenues generated by the facility  and pays the balance to covanta energy 
where tip fee structures exist  covanta energy retains of the energy revenues 
at of its projects  covanta energy sells its energy output under short term contracts or on a spot basis into the regional electricity grid 
at its tip fee projects  covanta energy generally has a greater exposure to energy market price fluctuation  as well as a greater exposure to project operating performance 
covanta energy operates the facility and generally guarantees that it will meet minimum waste processing capacity and efficiency standards  energy production levels and environmental standards 
covanta energy s failure to meet these guarantees or to otherwise observe the material terms of the service agreement unless caused by the client community or by events beyond its control  may result in liquidated damages charged to covanta energy or  if the breach is substantial  continuing and unremedied  the termination of the applicable agreement 
in the case of such a termination  covanta energy may be obligated to pay material damages  including payments to discharge project indebtedness 
at three publicly owned facilities covanta energy operates  the client community may terminate the operating contract under limited circumstances but without cause 

table of contents the client community is generally required to deliver minimum quantities of municipal solid waste to the facility on a put or pay basis and is obligated to pay a fee for its disposal 
a put or pay commitment means that the client community promises to deliver a stated quantity of waste and pay an agreed amount for its disposal 
this payment is due even if the counterparty delivers less than the full amount of waste promised 
where a service fee structure exists  portions of the service fee escalate to reflect indices of inflation 
in many cases the client community must also pay for other costs  such as insurance  taxes  and transportation and disposal of the ash residue to the disposal site 
if the facility is owned by covanta energy and a service fee structure exists  the client community also pays  as part of the service fee  an amount equal to the debt service due to be paid on the bonds issued to finance the facility 
generally  expenses resulting from the delivery of unacceptable and hazardous waste on the site are also borne by the client community 
in addition  the contracts generally require that the client community pay increased expenses and capital costs resulting from unforeseen circumstances  subject to limits which may be specified in the service agreement 
financing for covanta energy s domestic waste to energy projects is generally accomplished through tax exempt and taxable revenue bonds issued by or on behalf of the client community 
if the facility is owned by a covanta energy subsidiary  the client community loans the bond proceeds to the subsidiary to pay for facility construction and pays to the subsidiary amounts necessary to pay debt service 
for such facilities  project related debt is included as project debt short and long term in the consolidated financial statements 
generally  such debt is secured by the revenues pledged under the respective indentures and is collateralized by the assets of covanta energy s subsidiary with the only recourse to covanta energy being related to construction and operating performance defaults 
covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued instruments to their client communities and other parties which guarantee that covanta energy s operating subsidiaries will perform in accordance with contractual terms including  where required  the payment of damages 
such contractual damages could be material  and in circumstances where one or more subsidiary s contract has been terminated for its default  such damages could include amounts sufficient to repay project debt 
for facilities owned by client communities and operated by covanta energy subsidiaries  covanta energy s potential maximum liability as of december  associated with the repayment of project debt on such facilities was in excess of billion 
if covanta energy is asked to perform under one or more of such guarantees  its liability for damages upon contract termination would be reduced by funds held in trust and proceeds from sales of the facilities securing the project debt which is presently not estimable 
to date  covanta energy has not incurred material liabilities under such guarantees 
covanta energy s service and waste disposal agreements  as well as its energy contracts  expire at various times as noted in the table below 
the extent to which any such expiration will affect covanta energy will depend upon a variety of factors  including whether the project itself is owned by covanta energy or its municipal client  market conditions then prevailing  and whether the municipal client exercises options it may have to extend the contract term 
as covanta energy s contracts expire it will become subject to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing its revenues 
as its service agreements at municipally owned facilities expire  covanta energy intends to seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to operate several such facilities 
covanta energy also will seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
as covanta energy s service and waste disposal agreements at facilities it owns or leases begin to expire  it intends to seek replacement or additional contracts  and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time  covanta energy expects to be able to offer rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste while providing acceptable revenues to covanta energy 
at covanta energy owned facilities  the expiration of existing energy contracts will require covanta energy to sell its output either into the local electricity grid at prevailing rates or pursuant to new contracts 
there can be no assurance that covanta energy will be able to enter into such renewals  replacement or additional contracts  or that the terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to covanta energy

international waste and energy services business covanta energy conducts its international energy business through its wholly owned subsidiary  covanta power international holdings  inc cpih and its subsidiaries 
the largest element of cpih s waste and energy services business is its ownership in and operation of a mw gross pulverized coal fired electric generating facility in the philippines 
cpih also has interests in other fossil fuel generating projects in 
table of contents bangladesh  china  india and the philippines  a waste to energy project in italy and two small hydroelectric projects in costa rica 
in general  these projects provide cash returns primarily from equity distributions and  to a lesser extent  operating fees 
the projects sell the electricity and steam they generate under long term contracts or market concessions to utilities  governmental agencies providing power distribution  creditworthy industrial users  or local governmental units 
in select cases  such sales of electricity and steam may be provided under short term arrangements as well 
covanta energy presently has interests in international power projects with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately  mw gross with proportionate ownership in these facilities being approximately mw 
in addition to its headquarters in fairfield  new jersey  covanta energy s international business is facilitated through field offices in shanghai  china  chennai  india  manila  philippines  and bangkok  thailand 
general approach to international projects in developing its international business  covanta energy has employed the same general approach to projects as is described above with respect to domestic projects 
while covanta energy intends to focus its business primarily in domestic markets  it may seek to develop or participate in additional international projects  particularly waste to energy projects 
covanta energy s financing arrangements place limitations on investments and borrowings it may make in connection with such projects 
for information related to the revenues and identifiable assets of the international business  see note business segments of the notes 
the ownership and operation of facilities in foreign countries in connection with covanta energy s international business entails significant political and financial uncertainties that typically are not encountered in such activities in the united states as described in item a 
risk factors waste and energy services business specific risks exposure to international economic and political factors may materially and adversely affect our waste and energy services businesses 
many of the countries in which covanta energy operates are lesser developed countries or developing countries where the political  social and economic conditions are typically less stable than in the united states 
the financial condition and creditworthiness of the potential purchasers of power and services provided by covanta energy or of the suppliers of fuel for projects in these countries may not be as strong as those of similar entities in developed countries 
the obligations of the purchaser under the energy contract  the service recipient under the related service agreement and the supplier under the fuel supply agreement generally are not guaranteed by any host country or other creditworthy governmental agency 
at the time it develops a project  covanta energy undertakes a credit analysis of the proposed power purchaser or fuel supplier and to the extent appropriate and achievable within the commercial parameters of a project  requires such entities to provide financial instruments  such as letters of credit or arrangements regarding the escrowing of the receivables 
covanta energy has typically sought to negotiate long term contracts for the supply of fuel with creditworthy and reliable suppliers 
however  the reliability of fuel deliveries may be compromised by one or more of several factors that may be more acute or may occur more frequently in developing countries than in developed countries  including a lack of sufficient infrastructure to support deliveries under all circumstances  bureaucratic delays in the import  transportation and storage of fuel in the host country  customs and tariff disputes  and local or regional unrest or political instability 
in most of the foreign projects in which covanta energy participates  it has sought  to the extent practicable  to shift the consequences of interruptions in the delivery of fuel whether due to the fault of the fuel supplier or due to reasons beyond the fuel supplier s control to the electricity purchaser or service recipient by securing a suspension of its operating responsibilities under the applicable agreements and an extension of its operating concession under such agreements 
in some instances  covanta energy requires the energy purchaser or service recipient to continue to make payments in respect of fixed costs if such interruptions occur 
in order to mitigate the effect of short term interruptions in the supply of fuel  covanta energy has also endeavored to provide on site storage of fuel in sufficient quantities to address such interruptions 

table of contents payment for services that covanta energy provides will often be made in whole or in part in the domestic currencies of the host countries 
conversion of such currencies into us dollars generally is not assured by a governmental or other creditworthy country agency and may be subject to limitations in the currency markets  as well as restrictions of the host country 
in addition  fluctuations in the value of such currencies against the value of the us dollar may cause covanta energy s participation in such projects to yield less return than expected 
transfer of earnings and profits in any form beyond the borders of the host country may be subject to special taxes or limitations imposed by host country laws 
covanta energy has sought to participate in projects in jurisdictions where limitations on the convertibility and expatriation of currency have been lifted by the host country and where such local currency is freely exchangeable on the international markets 
in most cases  components of project costs incurred or funded in the currency of the united states are recovered without risk of currency fluctuation through negotiated contractual adjustments to the price charged for electricity or service provided 
this contractual structure may cause the cost in local currency to the project s power purchaser or service recipient to rise from time to time in excess of local inflation  and consequently there is risk in such situations that such power purchaser or service recipient will  at least in the near term  be less able or willing to pay for the project s power or service 
covanta energy has sought to manage and mitigate these risks through all means that it deems appropriate  including political and financial analysis of the host countries and the key participants in each project  guarantees of relevant agreements with creditworthy entities  political risk and other forms of insurance  participation by united states and or international development finance institutions in the financing of projects in which covanta energy participates  and joint ventures with other companies to pursue the development  financing and construction of these projects 
covanta energy determines which mitigation measures to apply based on its balancing of the risk presented  the availability of such measures and their cost 
in addition  covanta energy has generally participated in projects which provide services that are treated as a matter of national or key economic importance by the laws and politics of the host country 
therefore  there is a risk that the assets constituting the facilities of these projects could be temporarily or permanently expropriated or nationalized by a host country  made subject to local or national control or be subject to unfavorable legislative action  regulatory decisions or changes in taxation 
in certain cases  covanta energy has issued guarantees of its operating subsidiaries contractual obligations to operate certain international power projects 
the potential damages owed under such arrangements for international projects may be material if called 
depending upon the circumstances giving rise to such damages  the contractual terms of the applicable contracts  and the contract counterparty s choice of remedy at the time a claim against a guarantee is made  the amounts owed pursuant to one or more of such guarantees could be greater than covanta energy s then available sources of funds 
to date  covanta energy has not incurred any material liabilities under its guarantees on international projects 
covanta energy s international power projects are identified below under international project summaries 
the following describes the important features of these projects  by fuel type waste to energy covanta energy owns a equity interest in an mw mass burn waste to energy project at trezzo sull adda in the lombardy region of italy the trezzo project which burns up to metric tons per day of municipal solid waste 
the remainder of the equity in the project is held by a subsidiary of falck spa and the municipality of trezzo sull adda 
the trezzo project is operated by ambiente srl a  an italian special purpose limited liability company of which covanta energy owns 
the solid waste supply for the project comes from municipalities and privately owned waste haulers under long term contracts 
the electrical output from the trezzo project is sold at governmentally established preferential rates under a long term purchase contract to italy s state owned grid operator  gestore della rete di trasmissione nazionale spa grtn 
a also entered into a year operations and maintenance agreement to operate and maintain a mw waste to energy facility capable of processing up to metric tons per day of refuse derived fuel in the municipality of san vittore del lazio frosinone  italy the san vittore project

there can be no assurance as to the outcome of this dispute  or that a will operate the san vittore project 
hydroelectric covanta energy operates two hydroelectric facilities in costa rica through an operating subsidiary pursuant to long term contracts 
covanta energy also has a nominal equity investment in each project 
the electric output from both of these facilities is sold to instituto costarricense de electricidad  a costa rica national electric utility 
coal a partnership  in which covanta energy holds a equity interest  owns a mw gross coal fired electric power generation facility located in mauban  quezon province  the philippines  the quezon project 
the remaining equity interests are held by an affiliate of international generating company  an affiliate of general electric capital corporation  and an entity owned by the original project developer 
the project company sells electricity to manila electric company meralco  the largest electric distribution company in the philippines  which serves the area surrounding and including metropolitan manila 
under an energy contract expiring in  meralco is obligated to take or pay for stated minimum annual quantities of electricity produced by the facility at an all in tariff which consists of capacity  operating  energy  transmission and other fees adjusted to inflation  fuel cost and foreign exchange fluctuations 
project management continues to negotiate with meralco with respect to proposed amendments to the power purchase agreement to modify certain commercial terms under the existing contract and to resolve issues relating to the project s performance during its first year of operation 
the project company has entered into two coal supply contracts expiring in and under these supply contracts  the cost of coal is determined using a base energy price adjusted to fluctuations of specified international benchmark prices 
covanta energy is operating the project through a subsidiary under a long term agreement with the project company 
in  the project lenders permitted the full release for distribution of cash previously required to be held back in excess of reserve requirements 
in addition  the project lenders granted an extension of an existing waiver permitting the project to continue to forego obtaining certain project insurance coverage levels that are not available at commercially reasonable rates 
the financial condition of meralco has been stressed by the failure of regulators to grant tariff increases to allow meralco to achieve rates of return permitted by law 
however  in late  meralco successfully refinanced million us in expiring short term debt on a long term seven year basis  improving meralco s financial condition 
covanta energy has obtained political risk insurance for its equity investment in this project 
covanta energy has majority equity interests in three coal fired cogeneration facilities in three provinces in the people s republic of china 
two of these projects the yanjiang project and the linan project are operated by the project entity in which covanta energy holds a majority interest 
the third project the huantai project is operated by an affiliate of that project s minority equity shareholder 
parties holding minority positions in the projects include a private company  a local government enterprise and affiliates of the local municipal government 
in connection with the linan project  the local people s congress has enacted a non binding resolution calling for the relocation of the cogeneration facility from the city center to an industrial zone 
the project company continues to review its options in this matter 
while the steam produced at each of the three projects is intended to be sold under long term contracts to the industrial hosts  in practice  steam has been sold on either a short term basis to local industries or the industrial hosts  in each case at varying rates and quantities 
at the yanjiang and linan projects  the electric power is sold at an average grid rate to a subsidiary of the provincial power bureau 
at the huantai project  the electric power is sold directly to the industrial host at a similar rate 
in december  covanta energy entered into a letter of intent to sell the assets of the huantai project to an affiliate of the minority equity shareholder for a sale price of million in cash 
the potential sale of this interest is subject to satisfactory diligence by the 
table of contents purchaser and execution of definitive documentation 
covanta can provide no assurance that such proposed sale will close 
natural gas covanta energy holds a equity interest in a barge mounted mw gross diesel natural gas fired electric power generation facility located near haripur  bangladesh the haripur project 
the remaining equity interests are held by an affiliate of el paso energy corporation and an affiliate of wartsila north america  inc subject to consents from the project lenders and the government of bangladesh  el paso energy corporation is in the process of transferring its interest in the project to globaleq asia holdings limited 
the electrical output of the project is sold to the bangladesh power development board bpdb  pursuant to an energy contract with minimum energy off take provisions at a tariff divided into a fuel component and an other component 
the fuel component reimburses the fuel cost incurred by the project up to a specified heat rate 
the other component consists of a pre determined base rate adjusted to actual load factor and foreign exchange fluctuations 
the energy contract also obligates the bpdb to supply all the natural gas requirements of the project at a pre determined base cost adjusted to fluctuations on actual landed cost of the fuel in bangladesh 
the bpdb s obligations under the agreement are guaranteed by the government of bangladesh 
covanta energy is operating the project through a subsidiary under a long term agreement with the project company 
in  the project obtained the extension of an existing waiver from the project lenders permitting it to continue to forego obtaining certain project insurance coverage levels that are not available at commercially reasonable rates 
covanta energy has obtained political risk insurance for its equity interest in this project 
diesel heavy fuel oil covanta energy holds majority equity interests in two mw gross heavy fuel oil fired electric power generation facilities in india 
the first project  where covanta energy holds a equity interest  is located near samalpatti  in the state of tamil nadu the samalpatti project 
the remaining equity interests are held by affiliates of shapoorji pallonji infrastructure capital co 
ltd 
and by wartsila india power investment  llc 
the second project  where covanta energy holds a equity interest  is located at samayanallur  also in the state tamil nadu the madurai project 
the balance of this equity interest is held by an indian company controlled by the original project developer 
the electrical output of both projects is sold to the tamil nadu electricity board tneb pursuant to long term agreements with full pass through tariffs at a specified heat rates  operation and maintenance costs  and equity returns 
tneb s obligations are guaranteed by the government of the state of tamil nadu 
indian oil companies supply the oil requirements of both projects through year fuel supply agreements based on market prices 
covanta energy operates both projects through subsidiaries under long term agreements with the project companies 
disputing several tariff provisions  tneb has failed to pay the full amount due under the energy contracts for both the samalpatti and madurai projects 
similar to many indian state electricity boards  tneb has also failed to fund the escrow account or post a letter of credit required under the project energy contracts  which failure constitutes a default under the project finance documents 
the project lenders for both projects have not declared an event of default due to this matter and have permitted continued distributions of project dividends 
to date  tneb has paid the undisputed portion of its payment obligations approximately representing each project s operating costs  fuel costs  debt service and some equity return 
project lenders for both projects have either granted periodic waivers of such default or potential default and or otherwise approved scheduled equity distributions 
neither such default nor potential default in the project financing arrangements constitutes a default under covanta energy s recourse debt 
tneb has indicated a desire to renegotiate tariffs for both project energy contracts  and it is possible that the issue of the escrow account or letter of credit requirement will be resolved as part of any such process 
a subsidiary of covanta energy owns and operates a mw heavy fuel oil fired electric power generation facility located in the province of cavite  the philippines the magellan project 
due to high fuel pricing and low tariff conditions  project revenues were insufficient to cover both operating costs and debt service beyond the second quarter of and in may  the magellan project company filed a petition for

business development covanta s opportunities for growth by investing in new domestic business will be limited by covanta energy s debt covenants  as well as by competition from other companies in the waste disposal and energy businesses 
for covanta to achieve meaningful growth  due to the capital intensive nature of its municipal solid waste processing and energy generating projects  covanta must be able to invest its own funds  obtain equity or debt financing  and provide support to its operating subsidiaries 
covanta s domestic project development has recently concentrated on working with its client communities to expand existing waste to energy project capacities  and has one project in advanced stages of development and another in construction 
covanta is pursuing additional expansion opportunities  as well as opportunities in businesses ancillary to its existing business such as additional waste transfer  transportation  processing and landfill businesses 
covanta is also pursuing international waste and or energy business opportunities  particularly in markets where the regulatory environment encourages waste to energy development  such as in italy  where covanta has an existing presence  as well as in the united kingdom 
covanta s development efforts regarding project expansions are described below 
hillsborough county  florida covanta energy designed  constructed and now operates and maintains this  tpd mass burn waste to energy facility located in and owned by hillsborough county 
due to the growth in the amount of municipal solid waste generated in hillsborough county  hillsborough county informed covanta energy of its desire to expand the facility s waste processing and electricity generation capacities  a possibility contemplated by the original contract between covanta energy and hillsborough county 
in august  covanta energy and hillsborough county entered into agreements to implement this expansion  and to extend the agreement under which covanta energy operates the facility  which would otherwise expire in  through environmental and other project related permits will need to be secured and financing completed by hillsborough county in order for the agreements to take effect and construction to commence 
lee county  florida covanta energy designed  constructed and now operates and maintains this  tpd mass burn waste to energy facility located in and owned by lee county 
due to the growth in the amount of solid waste generated in lee county  lee county informed covanta energy of its desire to engage covanta energy to manage the expansion of the facility s waste processing and electricity generation capacities  a possibility contemplated by the original contract between covanta energy and lee county 
as part of the agreement to implement this expansion  covanta energy received a long term operating contract extension expiring in contracts for construction of the expansion and contracts for operation and maintenance of the expanded facility have been executed by the parties 
the principal environmental permit for the expansion has been received and construction of the expansion has commenced 

table of contents honolulu  hawaii this  ton per day refuse derived fuel facility was designed and constructed by an entity not related to covanta energy 
subsequently  covanta energy purchased the rights to operate and maintain the facility on behalf of the city and county of honolulu 
previously  the city and county of honolulu had informed covanta energy of their desire to expand the facility s waste processing capacity  a possibility contemplated by the original contract between covanta energy and the city and county of honolulu 
however  more recently the city and county of honolulu may be reconsidering their desire to expand their facility and are evaluating alternatives to accommodate their waste disposal needs 
at this time  there can be no assurance that any definitive agreements will be finalized or approved by the parties or that the city and county of honolulu will  in fact  expand the facility 
other services business discussion of other services business given the significance of the covanta energy and arc holdings acquisitions to covanta s business  results of operations and financial condition  covanta decided  during the third quarter of  to combine the previously separate business segments of insurance services and parent only operations into one reportable segment referred to as other services 
certain prior period amounts  such as parent investment income  have been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period presentation 
the operations of the parent company prior to the acquisition of covanta energy on march   primarily included general and administrative expense related to officer salaries  legal and other professional fees and insurance 
subsequent to the acquisition of covanta energy  these expenses are reimbursed by covanta energy under an administrative services agreement 
the parent company operations also include income earned on its investments 
insurance business following the acquisitions of covanta energy and arc holdings  the relative contribution of covanta s insurance business to covanta s cash flow and its relative percentage of covanta s financial obligations were significantly reduced 
consequently  unlike prior years  covanta s insurance business neither contributes materially to covanta s cash flow nor imposes material financial obligations on covanta 
covanta s insurance business continues to represent an important element of covanta s structure in that its net operating loss carryforwards nols were primarily generated through the operations of former subsidiaries of danielson indemnity company dind 
covanta s ability to utilize that portion of the nols will depend upon the continued inclusion of its insurance business in covanta s consolidated federal income tax return 
see note income taxes of the notes for more information on covanta s nols 
covanta s insurance operations are conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries 
naicc  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of covanta through dind  is covanta s principal operating insurance subsidiary 
references to naicc include naicc and its subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated 
naicc has historically managed its business across four principal lines of business non standard private passenger automobile  commercial automobile  workers compensation  and property and casualty 
however  as of december   naicc was engaged in writing exclusively non standard private passenger automobile primarily in california 
as discussed more fully below  covanta s insurance businesses have succeeded in reducing their loss ratio by tightening underwriting criteria  exiting unprofitable lines of business and focusing on writing more profitable lines of business through its arrangements with third parties providing marketing  underwriting and administration services 
such third parties do not have rate making authority or authority to enter into reinsurance arrangements 
such third parties are paid flat commission on new and renewal policies written and they participate in an incentive compensation arrangement dictated solely by underwriting results 

table of contents insurers admitted in california are required to obtain approval  from the california department of insurance  of rates and or forms prior to being used 
many of the other states in which naicc does business have similar requirements 
rates and policy forms are developed by naicc and filed with the regulators in each of the relevant states  depending upon each state s requirements 
naicc relies upon its own  as well as industry  experience in establishing rates 
non standard risks are those segments of the driving public which generally are not considered preferred business  such as drivers with a record of prior accidents or driving violations  drivers involved in particular occupations or driving certain types of vehicles  or those drivers whose policies have not been renewed or whose policies have been declined by another insurance company 
generally  in order to address the associated higher risk of non standard private automobile insurance  their premium rates are higher than standard premium rates while policy limits are lower than typical policy limits 
policyholder selection is governed by underwriting guidelines established by naicc 
management believes that it is able to achieve underwriting success through refinement of various risk profiles  thereby dividing the non standard market into more defined segments which can be adequately priced 
additionally  traditional lower policy limits lend themselves to quicker claims processing allowing management to respond more quickly to changing loss trends  by revising underlying underwriting guidelines and class and rate filings accordingly 
naicc maintains reserves with respect to net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense lae  representing the estimated indemnity cost and expense necessary to cover the ultimate net cost of investigating and settling claims 
such estimates are based upon estimates for reported losses  historical company experience of losses reported by reinsured companies for insurance assumed and actuarial estimates based upon historical company and industry experience for development of reported and unreported claims incurred but not reported 
any changes in estimates of ultimate liability are reflected in current operating results 
inflation is assumed  along with other factors  in estimating future claim costs and related liabilities 
naicc does not discount any of its loss reserves 
naicc believes its provisions for unpaid losses and lae are adequate to cover the net cost of losses and loss expenses incurred to date  and that it satisfies all reserve based capital requirements imposed under applicable insurance regulations 
in its normal course of business  naicc typically reinsures a portion of its exposure with other insurance companies so as to effectively limit its maximum loss arising out of any one occurrence 
contracts of reinsurance do not legally discharge the original insurer from its primary liability 
estimated reinsurance receivables arising from these contracts of reinsurance are reported separately as assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
markets  competition and business conditions general business conditions covanta energy s business can be adversely affected by general economic conditions  war  inflation  adverse competitive conditions  governmental restrictions and controls  changes in laws  natural disasters  energy shortages  fuel costs  weather  the adverse financial condition of customers and suppliers  various technological changes and other factors over which covanta energy has no control 
covanta energy expects in the foreseeable future that competition for new contracts and projects will be intense in all markets in which covanta energy conducts or intends to conduct its businesses  and its businesses will be subject to a variety of competitive and market influences 
with respect to its waste related businesses  including its waste to energy and transriver businesses  covanta energy competes in the waste disposal market  which is highly competitive 
while covanta energy currently processes for disposal over of the municipal solid waste in the united states  the market for waste 
table of contents disposal is almost entirely price driven and is greatly influenced by economic factors within regional waste sheds 
these factors include regional population and overall waste production rates  the number of other waste disposal sites including principally landfills and transfer stations in existence or in the planning or permitting process  the available disposal capacity in terms of tons of waste per day that can be offered by other regional disposal sites  and the availability and cost of transportation options rail  intermodal  trucking to provide access to more distant disposal sites  thereby affecting the size of the waste shed itself 
in the waste disposal market  disposal service providers seek to obtain waste supplies to their facilities by competing on disposal price usually on a per ton basis with other disposal service providers 
at all but of its waste to energy facilities  covanta energy typically is unable to compete in this market because it does not have the contractual right to solicit waste 
at these facilities  it is the client community which is responsible for obtaining the waste  if necessary by competing on price to obtain the tons of waste it has contractually promised to deliver to covanta energy s facility 
at of its waste to energy facilities and at its transriver businesses  covanta energy is responsible for obtaining material amounts of waste supply and therefore  is actively competing in these markets to enter into spot medium and long term contracts 
all of these waste to energy projects are in densely populated areas  with high waste generation rates and numerous large and small participants in the regional market 
certain of its competitors in these markets are vertically integrated waste companies which include waste collection operations  and thus have the ability to control supplies of waste which may restrict covanta energy s ability to offer disposal services at attractive prices 
covanta energy s business does not include waste collection operations 
covanta energy s waste operations are largely concentrated in the northeastern united states 
see item a 
risk factors waste and energy services business specific risks covanta energy s waste operations are concentrated in one region  and expose us to regional economic or market declines for additional information concerning this geographic concentration 
if a long term contract expires and is not renewed or extended by a client community  covanta energy s percentage of contracted disposal capacity will decrease  and it will need to compete in the regional market for waste disposal 
at that point  it will compete on price with landfills  transfer stations  other waste to energy facilities and other waste disposal technologies that are then offering disposal service in the region 
see discussion under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview waste and energy service contract duration for additional information concerning the expiration of existing contracts 
covanta may develop or acquire  itself or jointly with others  additional waste or energy projects or businesses 
if it were to do so in a competitive procurement  covanta would face competition in the selection process from other companies  some of which may have greater financial resources than covanta 
if it were selected  the amount of market competition it would thereafter face would depend upon the extent to which the capacity at any such project would be committed under contract 
if covanta were to develop or acquire additional projects or businesses not in the context of a competitive procurement  it would face competition in the regional market and compete on price with landfills  transfer stations  other waste to energy facilities  other energy producers and other waste disposal or energy generation technologies that are then offering service in the region 
with respect to its sales of electricity from its waste to energy projects and independent power projects  covanta energy primarily sells its output pursuant to long term contracts 
accordingly  it generally does not sell its output into markets where it must compete on price 
as these contracts expire  covanta energy will participate in such markets if it is unable to enter into new or renewed long term contracts 
see discussion under item a 
risk factors waste and energy services business specific risks covanta energy may 
table of contents face increased risk of market influences on its domestic revenues after its contracts expire for additional information concerning the expiration of existing contracts 
once a contract is awarded or a project is financed and constructed  covanta energy s business can be impacted by a variety of risk factors which can affect profitability over the life of a project 
some of these risks are at least partially within covanta energy s control  such as successful operation in compliance with law and the presence or absence of labor difficulties or disturbances 
other risk factors are largely out of covanta energy s control and may have an adverse impact on a project over a long term operation 
see item a 
risk factors waste and energy services business specific risks for more information on these types of risks 
technology covanta energy has the exclusive right to market in the united states the proprietary mass burn technology of martin gmbh fur umwelt und energietechnik  referred to herein as martin 
the principal feature of the martin technology is the reverse reciprocating stoker grate upon which the waste is burned 
the patent for the basic stoker grate technology used in the martin technology has expired and there are various other expired and unexpired patents relating to the martin technology 
covanta energy believes that it is martin s know how and worldwide reputation in the waste to energy field  and covanta energy s know how in designing  constructing and operating waste to energy facilities  rather than the use of patented technology  that is important to covanta energy s competitive position in the waste to energy industry in the united states 
covanta energy does not believe that the expiration of the remaining patents covering portions of the martin technology will have a material adverse effect on covanta energy s financial condition or competitive position 
covanta energy believes that mass burn technology is now the predominant technology used for the combustion of municipal solid waste 
covanta energy believes that the martin technology is a proven and reliable mass burn technology  and that its association with martin has created significant name recognition and value for covanta energy s domestic waste to energy business 
since  covanta energy s rights to the martin technology have been provided pursuant to a cooperation agreement with martin which gives covanta energy exclusive rights to market  and distribute parts and equipment for the martin technology in the united states  canada  mexico  bermuda and certain caribbean countries 
martin is obligated to assist covanta energy in installing  operating and maintaining facilities incorporating the martin technology 
the cooperation agreement renews automatically each year unless notice of termination is given  in which case the cooperation agreement would terminate ten years after such notice 
any termination would not affect the rights of covanta energy to design  construct  operate  maintain or repair waste to energy facilities for which contracts have been entered into or proposals made prior to the date of termination 
through facility acquisitions  covanta energy owns and or operates some waste to energy facilities which utilize additional technologies  including non martin mass burn technologies  and refuse derived fuel technologies which include pre combustion waste processing not required with a mass burn design 
insurance business the insurance industry is highly competitive  comprised of a large number of companies  many of which operate in more than one state  offering automobile  homeowners and commercial property insurance  as well as insurance coverage in other lines 
many of naicc s competitors have larger volumes of business  greater financial resources and higher financial strength ratings 
naicc s competitors having greater shares of the california market sell automobile insurance either directly to consumers  through independent agents and brokers or through exclusive agency arrangements similar to those utilized by naicc 
the principal means by which covanta s insurance business competes with other automobile insurers is by its focus on meeting the needs of the non standard private passenger automobile market in california where it believes it has competitive pricing  underwriting and service capabilities 
covanta s insurance business also competes by using niche marketing efforts of its products 

table of contents the operating results of a property and casualty insurer are influenced by a variety of factors including general economic conditions  competition  regulation of insurance rates  weather and frequency and severity of losses 
the california non standard personal automobile market in which naicc operates has experienced a recovery of rate adequacy  however  competition is rising with a number of new entrants into the marketplace  resulting in underwriting guidelines softening 
frequency of claims remained stable from to and increased in  while the average cost of settling claims has steadily improved from to regulation of business covanta s waste and energy services business and its insurance business are both highly regulated 
environmental regulatory laws affecting covanta s waste and energy services business covanta energy s business activities in the united states are pervasively regulated pursuant to federal  state and local environmental laws 
federal laws  such as the clean air act and clean water act  and their state counterparts  govern discharges of pollutants to air and water 
other federal  state and local laws comprehensively govern the generation  transportation  storage  treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and also regulate the storage and handling of chemicals and petroleum products such laws and regulations are referred to collectively as the environmental regulatory laws 
other federal  state and local laws  such as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as cercla and collectively referred to with such other laws as the environmental remediation laws  make covanta energy potentially liable on a joint and several basis for any onsite or offsite environmental contamination which may be associated with covanta energy s activities and the activities at sites 
these include landfills that covanta energy s subsidiaries have owned  operated or leased or  at which there has been disposal of residue or other waste generated  handled or processed by such subsidiaries 
some state and local laws also impose liabilities for injury to persons or property caused by site contamination 
some service agreements provide for indemnification of operating subsidiaries from certain liabilities 
in addition  other subsidiaries involved in landfill gas projects have access rights to landfill sites pursuant to certain leases that permit the installation  operation and maintenance of landfill gas collection systems 
a portion of these landfill sites have been federally designated superfund sites 
each of these leases provide for indemnification of the covanta energy subsidiary from some liabilities associated with these sites 
the environmental regulatory laws require that many permits be obtained before the commencement of construction and operation of any waste  independent power project or water facility  and further require that permits be maintained throughout the operating life of the facility 
there can be no assurance that all required permits will be issued or re issued  and the process of obtaining such permits can often cause lengthy delays  including delays caused by third party appeals challenging permit issuance 
failure to meet conditions of these permits or of the environmental regulatory laws can subject an operating subsidiary to regulatory enforcement actions by the appropriate governmental unit  which could include fines  penalties  damages or other sanctions  such as orders requiring certain remedial actions or limiting or prohibiting operation 
see item a 
risk factors waste and energy services business specific risks compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our results of operations 
to date  covanta energy has not incurred material penalties  been required to incur material capital costs or additional expenses  or been subjected to material restrictions on its operations as a result of violations of environmental regulatory laws or permit requirements 
although covanta energy s operations are occasionally subject to proceedings and orders pertaining to emissions into the environment and other environmental violations  which may result in fines  penalties  damages or other sanctions  covanta energy believes that it is in substantial compliance with existing environmental regulatory laws 
covanta energy may be identified  along with other entities  as being among parties potentially responsible for contribution to costs associated with the correction and remediation of environmental conditions at disposal sites subject to cercla and or analogous state laws 
in certain instances covanta energy may be exposed to joint and several liabilities for remedial action or damages 

table of contents covanta energy s ultimate liability in connection with such environmental claims will depend on many factors  including its volumetric share of waste  the total cost of remediation  and the financial viability of other companies that also sent waste to a given site and  in the case of divested operations  its contractual arrangement with the purchaser of such operations 
the environmental regulatory laws are subject to revision 
new technology may be required or stricter standards may be established for the control of discharges of air or water pollutants  for storage and handling of petroleum products or chemicals  or for solid or hazardous waste or ash handling and disposal 
thus  as new technology is developed and proven  it may be required to be incorporated into new facilities or major modifications to existing facilities 
this new technology may often be more expensive than that used previously 
the clean air act amendments of required the environmental protection agency epa to issue new source performance standards nsps and emission guidelines eg applicable to new and existing municipal waste combustion mwc units 
epa issued its first nsps and eg for large mwcs first mact rule in and covanta energy installed all new equipment needed to achieve the emissions limits imposed by the first mact rule prior to the december  general compliance deadline 
on december   epa issued for public comment its proposed revisions to the nsps and eg for large mwcs proposed mact revisions 
although epa does not propose to expand the list of regulated pollutants beyond those included in the first mact rule  its proposed mact revisions would lower the emission limits for most of those pollutants 
the public comment period for the proposed mact revisions closed on february   epa is expected to issue the final rule final mact rule in april the compliance deadlines for the final mact rule are expected to be july for the nsps new mwc units  and on or before april for the eg existing mwc units 
until the final mact rule is issued  it is not possible to predict with certainty its impact on waste to energy facilities operated by covanta energy subsidiaries 
however  covanta energy anticipates that it is unlikely existing waste to energy facilities will require capital improvements to comply with the eg 
it is  however  likely that most existing facilities will incur increased operating and maintenance costs 
the costs to covanta energy associated with compliance with the final mact rule is not expected to be material  and at many projects such costs are expected to be shared with covanta energy s municipal clients 
on november   epa issued a proposed rule to implement the revised national ambient air quality standards for fine particulate matter  or pm pm rule 
unlike the mact rules discussed above  the pm rule is not specific to waste to energy facilities  but instead is a nationwide standard for ambient air quality 
the primary impact of the pm rule will be on those counties in certain states that are designated by epa as non attainment with respect to those standards 
epa s proposed rule to implement the pm rule will guide how states achieve compliance with the pm rule  and could result in more stringent regulation of certain waste to energy facility emissions that already are regulated by the mact standards 
the costs to meet new rules for existing facilities owned by municipal clients generally will be borne by the municipal clients 
for projects owned or leased by covanta energy subsidiaries  the municipal clients generally have the obligation to fund such capital improvements  and at certain of its projects covanta energy may be required to fund a portion of the related costs 
in certain cases  the covanta energy subsidiary is required to fund the full cost of capital improvements 
covanta energy believes that most costs incurred to meet the final mact rule and pm rule at facilities it operates may be recovered from municipal clients and other users of its facilities through increased fees permitted to be charged under applicable contracts 
the environmental remediation laws prohibit disposal of regulated hazardous waste at covanta energy s municipal solid waste facilities 
the service agreements recognize the potential for improper deliveries of hazardous waste and specify procedures for dealing with hazardous waste that is delivered to a facility 
although some service agreements require covanta energy s subsidiary to be responsible for some 
table of contents costs related to hazardous waste deliveries  to date no operating subsidiary has incurred material hazardous waste disposal costs 
domestic drinking water facilities are subject to regulation of water quality by the state and federal agencies under the federal safe drinking water act and by similar state laws 
these laws provide for the establishment of uniform minimum national water quality standards  as well as governmental authority to specify the type of treatment processes to be used for public drinking water 
under the federal clean water act  covanta energy may be required to obtain and comply with national pollutant discharge elimination system permits for discharges from its treatment stations 
generally  under its current contracts  covanta energy is not responsible for fines and penalties resulting from the delivery to covanta energy s treatment facility of water not meeting standards set forth in those contracts 
energy and water regulations affecting covanta s waste and energy services business covanta energy s businesses are subject to the provisions of federal  state and local energy laws applicable to the development  ownership and operation of their domestic facilities and to similar laws applicable to their foreign operations 
federal laws and regulations applicable to many of covanta energy s domestic energy businesses impose limitations on the types of fuel used and prescribe the degree to which these businesses are subject to federal and state utility type regulation 
state regulatory regimes govern rate approval and the other terms and conditions pursuant to which utilities purchase electricity from independent power producers  except to the extent such regulation is governed by federal law 
pursuant to the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has promulgated regulations that exempt qualifying facilities facilities meeting certain size  fuel and ownership requirements  referred to as qfs from compliance with certain provisions of the federal power act fpa  the public utility holding company act of puhca through february  and certain state laws regulating the rates charged by  or the financial and organizational activities of  electric utilities 
purpa was enacted in to encourage the development of cogeneration facilities and other facilities making use of non fossil fuel power sources  including waste to energy facilities 
the exemptions afforded by purpa to qfs from regulation under the fpa and most aspects of state electric utility regulation are of great importance to covanta energy and its competitors in the waste to energy and independent power industries 
except with respect to waste to energy facilities with a net power production capacity in excess of mw where rates are set by the ferc  state public utility commissions must approve the rates  and in some instances other contract terms  by which public utilities purchase electric power from qfs 
the energy policy act of  passed in august  makes certain changes to the federal energy laws applicable to covanta energy s businesses  the most significant of which are described below the energy policy act repeals puhca  effective february  which eliminates any remote risk covanta energy might have faced by being subject to extensive  utility type regulation and reporting if it were considered a holding company under puhca 
the repeal of puhca has been balanced with increased ferc authority to cause record keeping and conduct investigations under appropriate circumstances 
as a company that owns only qfs  exempt wholesale generators and or foreign utility companies  covanta energy may be entitled to an exemption from ferc s authority to cause such record keeping and conduct such investigations if it timely files a ferc prescribed form  which it intends to do 
the energy policy act amends certain provisions of purpa 
it terminates purpa s mandatory purchase and sale obligation imposed on utilities for the benefit of qfs where the qf has nondiscriminatory access to competitive power markets 
existing contracts are grandfathered  but expansions  renewals and new development projects must rely on competitive power markets  rather than purpa protections  in establishing and maintaining their viability in most geographic regions in which the covanta energy businesses operate 
the energy policy act also eliminates the utility ownership limitation for qfs 
this change might have the effect of making some transactions and development projects more likely to be consummated 
this could result in greater utility ownership of 
table of contents qfs than previously was the case due to purpa and puhca restrictions and considerations 
if these transactions and development projects occur in the areas of waste to energy  other renewable energy and independent power  it could serve to increase competition with covanta energy s businesses by bringing greater utility participation to these markets 
the energy policy act extends or establishes certain renewable energy incentives and tax credits which might be helpful to expansions of covanta energy s businesses or to new development 
regulation affecting covanta s international business covanta energy presently has ownership and operating interests in electric generating projects outside the united states 
most countries have expansive systems for the regulation of the power business 
these generally include provisions relating to ownership  licensing  rate setting and financing of generation and transmission facilities 
covanta energy aims to provide energy generating and other infrastructure through environmentally protective project designs  regardless of the location of a particular project 
this approach is consistent with the stringent environmental requirements of multilateral financing institutions  such as the world bank  and also with covanta energy s experience in domestic waste to energy projects  where environmentally protective facility design and performance is required 
compliance with environmental standards comparable to those of the united states may be conditions to the provision of credit by multilateral banking agencies  as well as other lenders or credit providers 
the laws of other countries also may require regulation of emissions into the environment  and provide governmental entities with the authority to impose sanctions for violations  although these requirements are generally different from those applicable in the united states

risk factors waste and energy services business specific risks compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our results of operations 
as with domestic project development  there can be no assurance that all required permits will be issued  and the process can often cause lengthy delays 
regulation affecting covanta s insurance business insurance companies are subject to insurance laws and regulations established by the states in which they transact business 
the agencies established pursuant to these state laws have broad administrative and supervisory powers relating to the granting and revocation of licenses to transact business  regulation of trade practices  establishment of guaranty associations  licensing of agents  approval of policy forms  premium rate filing requirements  reserve requirements  the form and content of required regulatory financial statements  capital and surplus requirements and the maximum concentrations of certain classes of investments 
most states also have enacted legislation regulating insurance holding company systems  including acquisitions  extraordinary dividends  the terms of affiliate transactions and other related matters 
covanta and its insurance subsidiaries have registered as holding company systems pursuant to such legislation in california and montana  and routinely report to other jurisdictions 
the national association of insurance commissioners has formed committees and appointed advisory groups to study and formulate regulatory proposals on such diverse issues as the use of surplus debentures  accounting for reinsurance transactions and the adoption of risk based capital requirements 
it is not possible to predict the impact of future state and federal regulation on the operations of covanta or its insurance business 
naicc is an insurance company domiciled in the state of california and is regulated by the california department of insurance for the benefit of policyholders 
the california insurance code does not permit the payment of an extraordinary shareholder dividend without prior approval from the california insurance commissioner 
dividends are considered extraordinary if they exceed the greater of net income or of statutory surplus as of the preceding december st 
as of the date of this filing  and into the foreseeable future  naicc does not have sufficient accumulated earned surplus to pay dividends 
a model for determining the risk based capital requirements  referred to as rbc requirements  for property and casualty insurance companies was adopted in december the model generally assesses the 
table of contents assets at risk and underwriting operations and determines policyholders surplus levels necessary to support such activity 
naicc has calculated its rbc requirement under the most recent rbc requirement model and  as of december   it had capital in excess of the regulatory authorized control level 
as of december   the rbc requirement of naicc improved to compared to in employees as of december   covanta employed  full time employees worldwide  of which a majority are employed in the united states

in order to help us preserve the nols  our certificate of incorporation contains stock transfer restrictions designed to reduce the risk of an ownership change for purposes of section of the internal revenue code 
the transfer restrictions were implemented in  and we expect that the restrictions will remain in force as 
table of contents long as the nols are available 
we cannot assure you  however  that these restrictions will prevent an ownership change 
the nols will expire in various amounts  if not used  between and the internal revenue service irs has not audited any of our tax returns for any of the years during the carryforward period including those returns for the years in which the losses giving rise to the nols were reported 
we cannot assure you that we would prevail if the irs were to challenge the availability of the nols 
if the irs were successful in challenging our nols  all or some portion of the nols would not be available to offset our future consolidated taxable income and we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to covanta energy under a tax sharing agreement described below or to pay taxes that may be due from our consolidated tax group 
reductions in our nols could occur in connection with the administration of the grantor trusts associated with the mission insurance entities which are in state insolvency proceedings 
during or at the conclusion of the administration of these grantor trusts  material taxable income could result which could utilize a substantial portion of our nols  which in turn could materially reduce our cash flow and ability to service our current debt 
the impact of a material reduction in our nols could also cause an event of default under our current debt and a possible substantial reduction of our deferred tax asset  as reflected in our financial statements 
for a more detailed discussion of the mission insurance entities and the grantor trusts  please see note california grantor trust settlement and note income taxes of the notes and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
in addition  if our existing insurance business were to require capital infusions from us in order to meet certain regulatory capital requirements and were we to fail to provide such capital  some or all of our subsidiaries comprising our insurance business could enter insurance insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings 
in such event  such subsidiaries may no longer be included in our consolidated tax return  and a portion  which could constitute a significant portion  of our remaining nols may no longer be available to us 
in such event  there may be a significant inclusion of taxable income in covanta s federal consolidated income tax return 
reduced liquidity and price volatility could result in a loss to investors 
although our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange  there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of an investment in our common stock or as to the price an investor may realize upon the sale of our common stock 
these prices are determined in the marketplace and may be influenced by many factors  including the liquidity of the market for our common stock  the market price of our common stock  investor perception and general economic and market conditions  company performance  and waste and energy market conditions 
concentrated stock ownership and a restrictive certificate of incorporation provision may discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals 
as of march   sz investments together with egi fund  third avenue and laminar  separately own or will have the right to acquire approximately  and  respectively  or when aggregated  of our outstanding common stock 
although there are no agreements among sz investments  third avenue and laminar regarding their voting or disposition of shares of our common stock  the level of their combined ownership of shares of common stock could have the effect of discouraging or impeding an unsolicited acquisition proposal 
in addition  the change in ownership limitations contained in article fifth of our certificate of incorporation could have the effect of discouraging or impeding an unsolicited takeover proposal 
future sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
no prediction can be made as to the effect  if any  that future sales of our common stock  or the availability of our common stock for future sales  will have on the market price of our common stock 
sales in the public market of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
in addition  in connection with the covanta energy acquisition financing  we filed a registration statement on form s to register the resale of 
table of contents  shares of our common stock held by laminar  third avenue and sz investments  which was declared effective on august  in connection with our acquisition of arc holdings  we have agreed to register upon demand  within twelve months of the june  closing of the arc holdings acquisition  the resale of certain shares held or acquired by laminar  third avenue and sz investments in an underwritten public offering 
the potential effect of these shares being sold may be to depress the price at which our common stock trades 
our controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all acts of fraud 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within our companies have been prevented or detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
the design of any systems of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec  to implement section  we are required to furnish a report by our management to include in our annual report on form k regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
we have in the past discovered  and may potentially in the future  discover areas of our internal control over financial reporting which may require improvement 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
waste and energy services business specific risks in connection with the arc holdings acquisition  covanta has incurred a large amount of debt  and we cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to pay this debt 
following the acquisition of arc holdings  covanta energy had corporate debt of million  of which million remains outstanding as of december   which we have guaranteed 
our ability to service this debt will depend upon the continued operation and maintenance of our facilities  consistent with historical performance levels  compliance with our debt covenants under our  and our subsidiaries  various credit arrangements  compliance by our subsidiaries with their respective debt covenants in order to permit distributions of cash to covanta energy  
table of contents maintenance or enhancement of revenue from renewals or replacement of existing contracts  and from new contracts to expand existing facilities or operate additional facilities  market conditions affecting waste disposal and energy pricing  as well as competition from other companies for contract renewals  expansions and additional contracts  particularly after covanta energy s existing contracts expire  and the continued availability to covanta energy of the benefit of our nols under a tax sharing agreement 
for a more detailed discussion of covanta energy s domestic debt covenants  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of liquidity and capital resources waste and energy services segment and note long term debt of the notes 
covanta s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and other necessary expenses will depend on its ability to generate cash and receive dividends and distributions from its subsidiaries in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that covanta energy s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to pay this debt 
we may not have access to the cash flow and other assets of our subsidiaries that may be needed to make payment on covanta energy s debt 
much of our business is conducted through our subsidiaries 
our ability to make payments on the debt incurred by covanta energy is dependent on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries 
certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are already subject to project and other financing arrangements and will not guarantee our obligations on covanta energy s debts 
the debt agreements of these subsidiaries and affiliates generally restrict their ability to pay dividends  make distributions or otherwise transfer funds to us 
in addition  a substantial amount of the assets of our non guarantor subsidiaries and affiliates has been pledged as collateral under their respective project financing agreements  or financings at intermediate subsidiary levels  and will be excluded entirely from the liens in favor of covanta energy s financing 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of liquidity and capital resources waste and energy services segment and note long term debt of the notes for a more complete description of the terms of such indebtedness 
we cannot assure you that certain of the agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit our subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient dividends  distributions or loans to fund payments on the covanta energy indebtedness when due 
our ability to grow our waste and energy services business may be limited 
our ability to grow our waste and energy services business by investing in new projects may be limited by debt covenants in covanta energy s principal financing agreements  and by potentially fewer market opportunities for new waste to energy facilities 
our waste and energy services business is based upon building and operating municipal solid waste disposal and energy generating projects  which are capital intensive businesses that require financing through direct investment and the incurrence of debt 
the covenants in covanta energy s financing agreements limit investments in new projects or acquisitions of new businesses and place restrictions on covanta energy s ability to expand existing projects 
the covenants limit borrowings to finance new construction  except in limited circumstances related to expansions of existing facilities 

table of contents operation of our waste and energy services facilities and the expansion of facilities involve significant risks 
the operation of our waste and energy services facilities and the construction of new or expanded facilities involve many risks  including the inaccuracy of our assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of anticipated revenues  supply interruptions  the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  difficulty or inability to find suitable replacement parts for equipment  the unavailability of sufficient quantities of waste  decreases in the fees for solid waste disposal  decreases in the demand or market prices for recovered ferrous or non ferrous metal  disruption in the transmission of electricity generated  permitting and other regulatory issues  license revocation and changes in legal requirements  labor disputes and work stoppages  unforeseen engineering and environmental problems  unanticipated cost overruns  weather interferences  catastrophic events including fires  explosions  earthquakes  droughts and acts of terrorism  the exercise of the power of eminent domain  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
we cannot predict the impact of these risks on our waste and energy services business or operations 
these risks  if they were to occur  could prevent covanta energy and its subsidiaries from meeting their obligations under their operating contracts 
development  construction and operation of new projects may not commence as scheduled  or at all 
the development and construction of new facilities involves many risks including siting  permitting  financing and construction delays and expenses  start up problems  the breakdown of equipment and performance below expected levels of output and efficiency 
new facilities have no operating history and may employ recently developed technology and equipment 
our waste and energy services businesses maintain insurance to protect against risks relating to the construction of new projects  however  such insurance may not be adequate to cover lost revenues or increased expenses 
as a result  a new facility may be unable to fund principal and interest payments under its debt service obligations or may operate at a loss 
in certain situations  if a facility fails to achieve commercial operation  at certain levels or at all  termination rights in the agreements governing the facility s financing may be triggered  rendering all of the facility s debt immediately due and payable 
as a result  the facility may be rendered insolvent and we may lose our interest in the facility 
our insurance and contractual protections may not always cover lost revenues  increased expenses or liquidated damages payments 
although our waste and energy services businesses maintain insurance  obtain warranties from vendors  require contractors to meet certain performance levels and  in some cases  pass risks  we cannot control to the service recipient or output purchaser  the proceeds of such insurance  warranties  performance guarantees or risk sharing arrangements may not be adequate to cover lost revenues  increased expenses or liquidated damages payments 

table of contents performance reductions could materially and adversely affect us and our projects may operate at lower levels than expected 
most service agreements for our waste to energy facilities provide for limitations on damages and cross indemnities among the parties for damages that such parties may incur in connection with their performance under the contract 
in most cases  such contractual provisions excuse our waste and energy services businesses from performance obligations to the extent affected by uncontrollable circumstances and provide for service fee adjustments if uncontrollable circumstances increase its costs 
we cannot assure you that these provisions will prevent our waste and energy services businesses from incurring losses upon the occurrence of uncontrollable circumstances or that if our waste and energy services businesses were to incur such losses they would continue to be able to service their debt 
covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued or are party to performance guarantees and related contractual obligations associated with its waste to energy  independent power and water facilities 
with respect to its domestic businesses  covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued guarantees to their municipal clients and other parties that covanta energy s subsidiaries will perform in accordance with contractual terms  including  where required  the payment of damages or other obligations 
the obligations guaranteed will depend upon the contract involved 
many of covanta energy s subsidiaries have contracts to operate and maintain waste to energy facilities 
in these contracts the subsidiary typically commits to operate and maintain the facility in compliance with legal requirements  to accept minimum amounts of solid waste  to generate a minimum amount of electricity per ton of waste  and to pay damages to contract counterparties under specified circumstances  including those where the operating subsidiary s contract has been terminated for default 
any contractual damages or other obligations incurred by covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries could be material  and in circumstances where one or more subsidiary s contract has been terminated for its default  such damages could include amounts sufficient to repay project debt 
additionally  damages payable under such guarantees on our owned waste to energy facilities could expose us to recourse liability on project debt 
covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries may not have sufficient sources of cash to pay such damages or other obligations 
we cannot assure you that covanta energy and such subsidiaries will be able to continue to avoid incurring material payment obligations under such guarantees or that if it did incur such obligations that they would have the cash resources to pay them 
our waste and energy services businesses generate their revenue primarily under long term contracts and must avoid defaults under their contracts in order to service their debt and avoid material liability to contract counterparties 
covanta energy s subsidiaries must satisfy performance and other obligations under contracts governing waste to energy facilities 
these contracts typically require covanta energy s subsidiaries to meet certain performance criteria relating to amounts of waste processed  energy generation rates per ton of waste processed  residue quantity and environmental standards 
the failure of covanta energy subsidiaries to satisfy these criteria may subject them to termination of their respective operating contracts 
if such a termination were to occur  covanta energy s subsidiaries would lose the cash flow related to the projects and incur material termination damage liability  which may be guaranteed by covanta energy or certain of its subsidiaries 
in circumstances where the contract of one or more subsidiaries has been terminated due to the default of the covanta energy subsidiary they may not have sufficient sources of cash to pay such damages 
we cannot assure you that covanta energy s subsidiaries will be able to continue to perform their respective obligations under such contracts in order to avoid such contract terminations  or damages related to any such contract termination  or that if they could not avoid such terminations that they would have the cash resources to pay amounts that may then become due 

table of contents covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have provided guarantees and support in connection with its subsidiaries projects 
covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries are obligated to guarantee or provide financial support for its subsidiaries projects in one or more of the following forms support agreements in connection with service or operating agreement related obligations  direct guarantees of certain debt relating to three of its facilities  contingent obligation to pay lease payment installments in connection with three of its facilities  contingent credit support for damages arising from performance failures  environmental indemnities  and contingent capital and credit support to finance costs  in most cases in connection with a corresponding increase in service fees  relating to uncontrollable circumstances 
many of these contingent obligations cannot readily be quantified  but  if we were required to provide this support  it may be material to our cash flow and financial condition 
covanta energy may face increased risk of market influences on its domestic revenues after its contracts expire 
covanta energy s contracts to operate waste to energy projects expire on various dates between and  and its contracts to sell energy output generally expire when the project s operating contract expires 
expiration of these contracts will subject covanta to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing its revenues 
as its operating contracts at municipally owned projects approach expiration  covanta energy will seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to continue operating such projects 
however  we cannot assure you that covanta energy will be able to enter into renewal or replacement contracts on terms favorable to it  or at all 
covanta energy will seek to bid competitively for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
the expiration of existing energy sales contracts  if not renewed  will require covanta energy to sell project energy output either into the electricity grid or pursuant to new contracts 
at some of our facilities  market conditions may allow covanta energy to effect extensions of existing operating contracts along with facility expansions 
such extensions and expansions are currently being considered at a limited number of covanta energy s facilities in conjunction with its municipal clients 
if covanta energy is unable to reach agreement with its municipal clients on the terms under which it would implement such extensions and expansions  or if the implementation of these extensions  including renewals and replacement contracts  and expansions are materially delayed  this may adversely affect covanta energy s cash flow and profitability 
we cannot assure you that covanta energy will be able to enter into such contracts or that the terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to it 
our waste and energy services businesses depend on performance by third parties under contractual arrangements 
our waste and energy services businesses depend on a limited number of third parties to  among other things  purchase the electric and steam energy produced by its facilities  and supply and deliver the waste and other goods and services necessary for the operation of our energy facilities 
the viability of our facilities depends significantly upon the performance by third parties in accordance with long term contracts  and such performance depends on factors which may be beyond our control 
if those third parties do not perform their obligations  or are excused from performing their obligations because of nonperformance by our waste and energy services businesses or other parties to the contracts  or due to force majeure events or changes in laws or regulations  our waste and energy services businesses may not be able to secure alternate arrangements on substantially the same terms  if at all  for the services provided under the contracts 
in addition  the 
table of contents bankruptcy or insolvency of a participant or third party in our waste and energy services facilities could result in nonpayment or nonperformance of that party s obligations to us 
concentration of suppliers and customers may expose us to heightened financial exposure 
our waste and energy services businesses often rely on single suppliers and single customers at our facilities  exposing such facilities to financial risks if any supplier or customer should fail to perform its obligations 
our waste and energy services businesses often rely on a single supplier to provide waste  fuel  water and other services required to operate a facility and on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility s output 
in most cases our waste and energy services businesses have long term agreements with such suppliers and customers in order to mitigate the risk of supply interruption 
the financial performance of these facilities depends on such customers and suppliers continuing to perform their obligations under their long term agreements 
a facility s financial results could be materially and adversely affected if any one customer or supplier fails to fulfill its contractual obligations and we are unable to find other customers or suppliers to produce the same level of profitability 
we cannot assure you that such performance failures by third parties will not occur  or that if they do occur  such failures will not adversely affect the cash flows or profitability of our waste and energy services business 
in addition  for their waste to energy facilities  our subsidiaries rely on their municipal clients as a source not only of waste for fuel but also of revenue from fees for disposal services our subsidiaries provide 
because contracts of our subsidiaries with their municipal clients are generally long term  our subsidiaries may be adversely affected if the credit quality of one or more of their municipal clients were to decline materially 
our waste and energy services business is subject to pricing fluctuations caused by the waste disposal and energy markets 
while our waste and energy services businesses both sell the majority of their waste disposal capacity and energy output pursuant to long term contracts  a portion of this capacity and output representing approximately of our anticipated revenue through is subject to market price fluctuation 
with the acquisition of arc holdings  a larger percentage of our revenue is subject to market risk from fluctuations in waste market prices than has historically been the case 
consequently  short term fluctuations in the waste and energy markets may have a greater impact on our revenues than we have previously experienced 
covanta energy s waste operations are concentrated in one region  and expose us to regional economic or market declines 
the majority of covanta energy s waste disposal facilities are located in the northeastern united states  primarily along the washington  dc to boston  massachusetts corridor 
adverse economic developments in this region could affect regional waste generation rates and demand for waste disposal services provided by covanta energy 
adverse market developments caused by additional waste disposal capacity in this region could adversely affect waste disposal pricing 
either of these developments could have a material adverse effect on covanta energy s revenues and cash generation 
some of covanta energy s energy contracts involve greater risk of exposure to performance levels which could result in materially lower revenues 
eight of our waste to energy facilities receive of the energy revenues they generate 
as a result  if we are unable to operate these facilities at their historical performance levels for any reason  our revenues from energy sales could materially decrease 

table of contents we may be unable to integrate the operations of arc holdings and covanta energy successfully and may not realize the full anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the recent acquisition of arc holdings will depend in part upon our ability to integrate the two companies businesses in an efficient and effective manner 
our attempt to integrate two companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges  and we may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully 
in particular  the necessity of coordinating organizations in additional locations and addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration 
the integration will require the dedication of significant management resources  which may temporarily distract management s attention from the day to day operations of the businesses of the combined company 
the process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of  or loss of momentum in  the activities of one or more of the combined company s businesses and the loss of key personnel 
employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may also disrupt the businesses of the combined company 
any inability of management to successfully integrate arc holdings operations with the operations of covanta energy could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
the anticipated benefits of the transaction include the elimination of duplicative costs  the strategic expansion of covanta energy s core waste to energy business in the northeast region of the united states and the strengthening of covanta energy s credit profile and lowering of our cost of capital 
we may not be able to realize  in whole or in part  or within the anticipated time frames  any of these expected costs savings or improvements 
the realization of the anticipated benefits of the transaction are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  we may not be able to achieve our expected results of operations and our actual income  cash flow or earnings available to satisfy debt obligations may be materially lower than the pro forma results we have previously filed with the sec 
exposure to international economic and political factors may materially and adversely affect our waste and energy services businesses 
cpih is a wholly owned subsidiary of covanta energy 
cpih s operations are conducted entirely outside the united states and expose it to legal  tax  currency  inflation  convertibility and repatriation risks  as well as potential constraints on the development and operation of potential business  any of which can limit the benefits to cpih of a foreign project 
cpih s projected cash distributions from existing facilities come from facilities located in countries with sovereign ratings below investment grade  including bangladesh  the philippines and india 
the financing  development and operation of projects outside the united states can entail significant political and financial risks  which vary by country  including changes in law or regulations  changes in electricity tariffs  changes in foreign tax laws and regulations  changes in united states federal  state and local laws  including tax laws  related to foreign operations  compliance with united states federal  state and local foreign corrupt practices laws  changes in government policies or personnel  changes in general economic conditions affecting each country  including conditions in financial markets  changes in labor relations in operations outside the united states  political  economic or military instability and civil unrest  and expropriation and confiscation of assets and facilities 

table of contents the legal and financial environment in foreign countries in which cpih currently owns assets or projects also could make it more difficult for it to enforce its rights under agreements relating to such projects 
any or all of the risks identified above with respect to the cpih projects could adversely affect our revenue and cash generation 
as a result  these risks may have a material adverse effect on our waste and energy services business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
exposure to foreign currency fluctuations may affect cpih s costs of operations 
cpih participates in projects in jurisdictions where limitations on the convertibility and expatriation of currency have been lifted by the host country and where such local currency is freely exchangeable on the international markets 
in most cases  components of project costs incurred or funded in the currency of the united states are recovered with limited exposure to currency fluctuations through negotiated contractual adjustments to the price charged for electricity or service provided 
this contractual structure may cause the cost in local currency to the project s power purchaser or service recipient to rise from time to time in excess of local inflation 
as a result  there is a risk in such situations that such power purchaser or service recipient will  at least in the near term  be less able or willing to pay for the project s power or service 
exposure to fuel supply prices may affect cpih s costs and results of operations 
changes in the market prices and availability of fuel supplies to generate electricity may increase cpih s cost of producing power  which could adversely impact our energy businesses profitability and financial performance 
the market prices and availability of fuel supplies of some of cpih s facilities fluctuate 
any price increase  delivery disruption or reduction in the availability of such supplies could affect cpih s ability to operate its facilities and impair its cash flow and profitability 
cpih may be subject to further exposure if any of its future operations are concentrated in facilities using fuel types subject to fluctuating market prices and availability 
we may not be successful in our efforts to mitigate our exposure to supply and price swings 
our inability to obtain resources for operations may adversely affect our ability to effectively compete 
our waste to energy facilities depend on solid waste for fuel  which provides a source of revenue 
for most of our facilities  the prices they charge for disposal of solid waste are fixed under long term contracts and the supply is guaranteed by sponsoring municipalities 
however  for some of our waste to energy facilities  the availability of solid waste to us  as well as the tipping fee that we must charge to attract solid waste to its facilities  depends upon competition from a number of sources such as other waste to energy facilities  landfills and transfer stations competing for waste in the market area 
in addition  we may need to obtain waste on a competitive basis as our long term contracts expire at our owned facilities 
there has been consolidation and there may be further consolidation in the solid waste industry which would reduce the number of solid waste collectors or haulers that are competing for disposal facilities or enable such collectors or haulers to use wholesale purchasing to negotiate favorable below market disposal rates 
the consolidation in the solid waste industry has resulted in companies with vertically integrated collection activities and disposal facilities 
such consolidation may result in economies of scale for those companies as well as the use of disposal capacity at facilities owned by such companies or by affiliated companies 
such activities can affect both the availability of waste to us for disposal at some of our waste to energy facilities and market pricing 
our efforts to grow our business will require us to incur significant costs in business development  often over extended periods of time  with no guarantee of success 
our efforts to grow our waste and energy business will depend in part on how successful we are in developing new projects and expanding existing projects 
the development period for each project may occur over several years  during which we incur substantial expenses relating to siting  design  permitting  community relations  financing  and professional fees associated with all of the foregoing 
not all of our development efforts will be successful  and we may decide to cease developing a project for a variety of 
table of contents reasons 
if the cessation of our development efforts were to occur at an advanced stage of development  we may have incurred a material amount of expenses for which we will realize no return 
compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our results of operations 
costs of compliance with federal  state and local existing and future environmental regulations could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability 
our waste and energy services businesses are subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities  primarily relating to air  waste including residual ash from combustion and water 
we are required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations and to obtain numerous governmental permits in operating our facilities 
our waste and energy services businesses may incur significant additional costs to comply with these requirements 
environmental regulations may also limit our ability to operate our facilities at maximum capacity or at all 
if our waste and energy services businesses fail to comply with these requirements  we could be subject to civil or criminal liability  damages and fines 
existing environmental regulations could be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities  and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur 
this may materially increase the amount we must invest to bring our facilities into compliance 
in addition  lawsuits or enforcement actions by federal and or state regulatory agencies may materially increase our costs 
stricter environmental regulation of air emissions  solid waste handling or combustion  residual ash handling and disposal  and waste water discharge could materially affect our cash flow and profitability 
our waste and energy services businesses may not be able to obtain or maintain  from time to time  all required environmental regulatory approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with them  the operation of our facilities could be jeopardized or become subject to additional costs 
energy regulation could adversely affect our revenues and costs of operations 
our waste and energy services businesses are subject to extensive energy regulations by federal  state and foreign authorities 
we cannot predict whether the federal  state or foreign governments will modify or adopt new legislation or regulations relating to the solid waste or energy industries 
the economics  including the costs  of operating our facilities may be adversely affected by any changes in these regulations or in their interpretation or implementation or any future inability to comply with existing or future regulations or requirements 
the fpa regulates energy generating companies and their subsidiaries and places constraints on the conduct of their business 
the fpa regulates wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities 
under purpa  our domestic facilities are exempt from most provisions of the fpa and state rate regulation 
our foreign projects are also exempt from regulation under the fpa 
the energy policy act of enacted comprehensive changes to the domestic energy industry which may affect our businesses 
the energy policy act removed certain regulatory constraints that previously limited the ability of utilities and utility holding companies to invest in certain activities and businesses  which may have the effect over time of increasing competition in energy markets in which we participate 
in addition  the energy policy act includes provisions that may remove some of the benefits provided to non utility electricity generators  like covanta energy  after its existing energy sale contracts expire 
as a result  we may face increased competition after such expirations occur 
if our waste and energy services businesses become subject to either the fpa or lose the ability under purpa to require utilities to purchase our electricity  the economics and operations of our energy projects could be adversely affected  including as a result of rate regulation by the ferc  with respect to our output of electricity  which could result in lower prices for sales of electricity 
in addition  depending on the terms of the project s power purchase agreement  a loss of our exemptions could allow the power purchaser to cease taking and paying for electricity under existing contracts 
such results could cause the loss of some or all contract revenues or otherwise impair the value of a project and could trigger defaults under provisions of the 
table of contents applicable project contracts and financing agreements 
defaults under such financing agreements could render the underlying debt immediately due and payable 
under such circumstances  we cannot assure you that revenues received  the costs incurred  or both  in connection with the project could be recovered through sales to other purchasers 
failure to obtain regulatory approvals could adversely affect our operations 
our waste and energy services businesses are continually in the process of obtaining or renewing federal  state and local approvals required to operate our facilities 
while our waste and energy services businesses currently have all necessary operating approvals  we may not always be able to obtain all required regulatory approvals  and we may not be able to obtain any necessary modifications to existing regulatory approvals or maintain all required regulatory approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain and comply with any required regulatory approvals  the operation of our facilities or the sale of electricity to third parties could be prevented  made subject to additional regulation or subject our waste and energy services businesses to additional costs or a decrease in revenue 
the energy industry is becoming increasingly competitive  and we might not successfully respond to these changes 
we may not be able to respond in a timely or effective manner to the changes resulting in increased competition in the energy industry in both domestic and international markets 
these changes may include deregulation of the electric utility industry in some markets  privatization of the electric utility industry in other markets and increasing competition in all markets 
to the extent us competitive pressures increase and the pricing and sale of electricity assumes more characteristics of a commodity business  the economics of our business may come under increasing pressure 
regulatory initiatives in foreign countries where our waste and energy services businesses have or will have operations involve the same types of risks 
changes in technology may have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
research and development activities are ongoing to provide alternative and more efficient technologies to dispose of waste or produce power  including fuel cells  microturbines and solar cells 
it is possible that advances in these or other technologies will reduce the cost of waste disposal or power production from these technologies to a level below our costs 
furthermore  increased conservation efforts could reduce the demand for power or reduce the value of our facilities 
any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
we have incurred and will continue to incur significant transaction and combination related costs in connection with the acquisition of arc holdings 
we expect to incur significant costs  which we currently estimate to be approximately million through  including costs incurred to date  associated with combining the operations of covanta energy and arc holdings 
however  we cannot predict with certainty the specific size of those charges at this preliminary stage of the integration process 
although we expect the elimination of duplicative costs  as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses  we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved as planned in the near future or at all 
insurance business specific risks insurance regulations may affect naicc s operations 
the insurance industry is highly regulated 
naicc is subject to regulation by state and federal regulators  and a significant portion of naicc s operations are subject to regulation by the state of california 
changes in existing insurance regulations or adoption of new regulations or laws which could affect naicc s results of operations and financial condition may include  without limitation  proposed changes to california s personal automobile rating regulations extension of california s low cost automobile program beyond los angeles and san francisco counties and changes to california s workers compensation laws 
we cannot 
table of contents predict the impact of changes in existing insurance regulations or adoption of new regulations or laws on naicc s results of operations and financial condition 
the insurance products sold by naicc are subject to intense competition 
the insurance products sold by naicc are subject to intense competition from many competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than naicc 
the california non standard personal automobile marketplace consists of over carriers 
in order to decrease rates  insurers in california must obtain prior permission for rate reductions from the california department of insurance 
in lieu of requesting rate decreases  competitors may soften underwriting standards as an alternative means of attracting new business 
such tactics  should they occur  would introduce new levels of risk for naicc and could limit naicc s ability to write new policies or renew existing profitable policies 
we cannot assure you that naicc will be able to successfully compete in these markets and generate sufficient premium volume at attractive prices to be profitable 
this risk is enhanced by the reduction in lines of business naicc writes as a result of its decision to reduce underwriting operations 
if naicc s loss experience exceeds its estimates  additional capital may be required 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on estimates of reported losses  historical company experience of losses reported for reinsurance assumed and historical company experience for unreported claims 
such liability is  by necessity  based on estimates that may change in the near term 
naicc cannot assure you that the ultimate liabilities will not exceed  or even materially exceed  the amounts estimated 
if the ultimate liability materially exceeds estimates  then additional capital may be required to be contributed to some of our insurance subsidiaries 
naicc and the other insurance subsidiaries received additional capital contributions from us in and  and naicc cannot provide any assurance that it and its subsidiaries will be able to obtain additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in addition  due to the fact that naicc and its other insurance subsidiaries are in the process of running off several significant lines of business  the risk of adverse development and the subsequent requirement to obtain additional capital is heightened 
failure to satisfy capital adequacy and risk based capital requirements would require naicc to obtain additional capital 
naicc is subject to regulatory risk based capital requirements 
depending on its risk based capital  naicc could be subject to various levels of increasing regulatory intervention ranging from company action to mandatory control by insurance regulatory authorities 
naicc s capital and surplus is also one factor used to determine its ability to distribute or loan funds to us 
if naicc has insufficient capital and surplus  as determined under the risk based capital test  it will need to obtain additional capital to establish additional reserves 
naicc cannot provide any assurance that it will be able to obtain such additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all

as a result of the consummation of the reorganization plan  covanta energy became a wholly owned subsidiary of covanta 
the results of operations and financial condition of covanta energy were consolidated for financial reporting purposes commencing on march  several subsidiaries of covanta energy did not emerge from the chapter proceedings on march  these subsidiaries are referred to herein as remaining debtors 
covanta has included lake county and warren county as consolidated subsidiaries in its financial statements since their respective emergence dates 
upon tampa bay s emergence from chapter  covanta energy did not have any operating or ownership rights in this facility 
on june   covanta acquired  through covanta energy  of the issued and outstanding shares of arc holdings 
arc holdings and its subsidiaries operate six waste to energy facilities located in the northeastern united states and transriver marketing company  lp transriver  a waste procurement company 
immediately upon closing of the acquisition  arc holdings became a wholly owned subsidiary of covanta energy  and covanta energy assumed control of the management and operations of the arc holdings facilities 
arc holdings results of operations were consolidated into covanta beginning on june  the nature of covanta s business  the risks attendant to such business and the trends that it will face have been significantly altered by these acquisitions 
the consolidated performance of covanta in and 
table of contents has predominantly reflected  and the continued future performance of covanta will predominantly reflect  the performance of its waste and energy services operations which are significantly larger than its insurance operations 
accordingly  covanta s financial performance prior to will not be comparable with its future performance and its financial performance in has been materially affected by the magnitude of the arc holdings acquisition relative to the size of the business of covanta prior to such acquisition 
readers are directed to management s discussion and analysis of covanta s waste and energy services business below for a discussion of management s perspective on important factors of operating and financial performance 
covanta s acquisition of arc holdings markedly increased the size and scale of its waste and energy services segment  and thus covanta s business 
while covanta s consolidated assets increased to billion at december  from billion at the end of  its consolidated debt increased to billion from billion in the same respective periods 
the acquisition of arc holdings also provided covanta energy with the opportunity to achieve cost savings by combining its businesses with those of arc holdings and the opportunity to refinance its existing recourse debt and thereby lower its cost of capital and obtain less restrictive covenants in the credit agreements 
with the acquisition of arc holdings  covanta s management is focused on providing its customers with superior service by operating its existing businesses to historic high standards  generating sufficient cash to meet its liquidity needs  paying down covanta energy s new debt  as well as project and intermediate holding company debt  with a stated goal of paying down million in debt at all levels between and the end of  and investing in and growing its business in order to create additional value for shareholders 
maintaining historic facility production levels while effectively managing operating and maintenance expense is important to optimize covanta energy s long term cash generation 
covanta energy does not expect to receive any cash contributions from covanta  and is prohibited under its principal financing arrangements from using its cash to issue dividends to covanta except in limited circumstances 
for expanded discussions of liquidity  see liquidity and capital resources below 
as part of the covanta energy acquisition  covanta agreed to conduct a rights offering for up to million shares of its common stock to certain holders of debentures issued by covanta energy prior to its bankruptcy at a purchase price of per share the offering 
because of the possibility that the offering could not be completed prior to the completion of the arc holdings acquisition  and the commencement of the related rights offering to shareholders the arc holdings rights offering  covanta restructured the offering so that the holders that participated in the offering were offered the right to purchase an additional million shares of covanta s common stock which was an equivalent number of shares of common stock that such holders would have been entitled to purchase in the arc holdings rights offering if the offering had been consummated on or prior to the record date for the arc holdings rights offering 
the purchase price for these additional shares was per share  the same purchase price as in the arc holdings rights offering 
on february   covanta completed the offering in which  shares were issued in consideration for million in gross proceeds 
covanta s liquidity is enhanced by the existence of net operating loss carryforwards nols  which predominantly arose from predecessor insurance entities of covanta formerly named mission insurance group  inc 
as described below  covanta s taxable income and loss relating to certain grantor trusts associated with these predecessor insurance entities continues to be included in covanta s consolidated tax group 
the internal revenue service irs has not audited any of covanta s tax returns relating to the years during which the nols were generated 
it is possible that the irs could undertake an audit of covanta s tax returns for such years  as well as subsequent years during which taxable income or loss of such grantor trusts continue to be included in covanta s consolidated tax group 
for additional detail relating to covanta s nols and risks attendant thereto  see note income taxes of the notes to the consolidated 
table of contents financial statements notes and item a 
risk factors we cannot be certain that our nols will continue to be available to offset our tax liability 
the ability of covanta to utilize its nols to offset taxable income generated by the waste and energy services operations could have a material effect on covanta s consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
covanta had nols estimated to be million for federal income tax purposes as of december  the nols will expire in various amounts from december  through december   if not used 
the amount of nols available to covanta energy will be reduced by any taxable income generated by current members of covanta s consolidated tax group  which include such grantor trusts associated with the mission insurance entities which have been in state insolvency proceedings in california and missouri since the late s 
during or at the conclusion of the administration of these grantor trusts by state insurance regulatory agencies  material taxable income could result which could utilize a substantial portion of covanta s nols  which in turn could materially reduce covanta s cash flow and its ability to service current debt and achieve debt reduction goals 
the impact of a material reduction in covanta s nols could also cause an event of default under covanta energy s current secured credit facilities and or a reduction of a substantial portion of covanta s deferred tax asset relating to such nols 
in january  covanta executed agreements with the california commissioner of insurance the california commissioner  who administers the majority of the grantor trusts  regarding the final administration and conclusion of such trusts 
the agreements  which were approved by the california state court overseeing the mission insolvency proceedings the mission court  will take effect upon satisfaction of remaining conditions and settle matters that had been in dispute regarding the historic rights and obligations relating to the conclusion of the grantor trusts 
the most significant of these conditions is a determination by the mission court of the aggregate amount of certain claims against the grantor trusts which are entitled to distributions of an aggregate of  shares of covanta common stock previously issued to the california commissioner under existing agreements entered into at the inception of the mission insurance entities reorganization 
the distribution of such shares by the california commissioner is among the final steps necessary to conclude the insolvency cases relating to the trusts being administered by the california commissioner  and such arrangements would include a process by which a complete list of such claimants would be identified  and thereafter the shares to be delivered to such claimants by the california commissioner 
in connection with these agreements and in order to facilitate the orderly conclusion of the grantor trust estates  the distribution of such stock and the settlement of the related disputes  covanta has agreed to pay an aggregate amount equal to approximately million to the california commissioner 
while covanta cannot predict with certainty what amounts  if any  may be includable in covanta s taxable income as a result of the final administration of the trusts  covanta believes that these arrangements with the california commissioner will result in no material reduction in available nols 
for additional information regarding these arrangements which are referred to herein as the california grantor trust settlement including its effects on covanta s deferred tax asset  see note california grantor trust settlement and note income taxes of the notes 
covanta is in preliminary discussions with the director of the division of insurance of the state of missouri the missouri director  who administers the balance of the grantor trusts relating to the mission insurance entities  regarding similar arrangements for distribution of the remaining  shares of covanta common stock by the missouri director to claimants of the missouri grantor trusts 
covanta cannot give any assurance that it will enter into similar arrangements with the missouri director or that the administration of such estates will not result in a material reduction in available nols 
covanta s business segments given the significance of the covanta energy and arc holdings acquisitions to covanta s results of operations and financial condition  covanta decided  during the third quarter of  to combine the previously separate business segments of insurance services and parent only operations into one reportable segment called other services 
covanta currently has two reportable business segments waste and energy services and other services 

table of contents waste and energy services the waste and energy services segment includes covanta energy s domestic and international businesses 
covanta energy s subsidiary covanta power international holdings  inc cpih and its subsidiaries engage in the independent power production business outside the united states 
for all waste to energy projects  covanta energy receives revenue from two primary sources fees it charges for operating projects or processing waste received and payments for electricity and steam sales 
covanta energy also operates  and in some cases has ownership interests in  transfer stations and landfills which generate revenue from waste disposal fees or operating fees 
in addition  covanta energy owns and in some cases operates other renewable energy projects in the united states which generate electricity from wood waste  landfill gas  and hydroelectric resources 
the electricity from these projects is sold to utilities 
for these projects  covanta energy receives revenue from electricity sales  and in some cases cash from equity distributions 
through cpih  covanta energy also has ownership interests in  and or operates  independent power production facilities in the philippines  china  bangladesh  india  and costa rica  and one waste to energy facility in italy 
the costa rica facilities generate electricity from hydroelectric resources while the other independent power production facilities generate electricity and steam by combusting coal  natural gas  or heavy fuel oil 
for these projects  cpih receives revenue from operating fees  electricity and steam sales  and in some cases cash from equity distributions 
contract structures covanta energy has waste to energy projects at which it charges a fixed fee which escalates over time pursuant to contractual indices covanta energy believes are appropriate to reflect price inflation for its operation and maintenance services 
these projects are referred to as having a service fee structure 
covanta energy s contracts at its service fee projects provide revenue that does not materially vary based on the amount of waste processed or energy generated and as such is relatively stable for the contract term 
in addition  at most of covanta energy s service fee projects  the operating subsidiary retains only a fraction of the energy revenues generated  with the balance used to provide a credit to the municipal client against its disposal costs 
therefore  in these projects  the municipal client derives most of the benefit and risk of energy production and changing energy prices 
covanta energy also has waste to energy projects at which it receives a per ton fee under contracts for processing waste 
these projects are referred to as having a tip fee structure 
at its tip fee projects  covanta energy generally enters into long term waste disposal contracts for a substantial portion of project disposal capacity and retains all of the energy revenue generated 
covanta energy s waste disposal and energy revenue from these projects is more dependent upon operating performance  and as such is subject to greater revenue fluctuation to the extent performance levels fluctuate 
under both structures  covanta s returns are expected to be stable if it does not incur material unexpected operation and maintenance costs or other expenses 
in addition  most of covanta energy s waste to energy project contracts are structured so that contract counterparties generally bear  or share in  the costs associated with events or circumstances not within covanta energy s control  such as uninsured force majeure events and changes in legal requirements 
the stability of covanta energy s domestic revenues and returns could be affected by its ability to continue to enforce these obligations 
also  at some of covanta energy s waste to energy facilities  commodity price risk is mitigated by passing through commodity costs to contract counterparties 
with respect to its domestic and international independent power projects  such structural features generally do not exist because either covanta energy operates and maintains such facilities for its own account or does so on a cost plus basis rather than a fixed fee basis 
certain energy contracts related to domestic projects provide for energy sales prices linked to the avoided costs of producing such energy and  therefore  energy revenues fluctuate with various economic factors 
three of covanta energy s waste to energy facilities have the ability to sell electricity under either 
table of contents contracts or to the regional electricity grid without a contract  and therefore are subject to energy market price fluctuations 
at some of covanta energy s domestic and international independent power projects  covanta energy s operating subsidiary purchases fuel in the open markets 
covanta energy is exposed to fuel price risk at these projects 
at other plants  fuel costs are contractually included in covanta energy s electricity revenues  or fuel is provided by covanta energy s customers 
in some of covanta energy s international projects  the project entity which in some cases is not a subsidiary of covanta energy has entered into long term fuel purchase contracts that protect the project from changes in fuel prices  provided counterparties to such contracts perform their commitments 
seasonal effects covanta energy s quarterly operating income from domestic and international operations within the same fiscal year typically differs substantially due to seasonal factors  primarily as a result of the timing of scheduled plant maintenance 
covanta energy typically conducts scheduled maintenance periodically each year  which requires that individual boiler units temporarily cease operations 
during these scheduled maintenance periods  covanta energy incurs material repair and maintenance expenses and receives less revenue  until the boiler units resume operations 
this scheduled maintenance typically occurs during periods of off peak electric demand in the spring and fall 
the spring scheduled maintenance period is typically more extensive than scheduled maintenance conducted during the fall 
as a result covanta energy has typically incurred its highest maintenance expense in the first half of the year 
given these factors  covanta energy has typically experienced lower operating income from its projects during the first six months of each year  and higher operating income during the second six months of each year 
contract duration covanta energy operates its domestic waste to energy projects under long term agreements 
energy sales contracts at covanta energy owned waste to energy projects generally expire at or after the date on which that project s agreement expires 
expiration of these contracts will subject covanta energy to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing its revenues 
as its agreements at municipally owned projects expire  covanta energy will seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to continue operating such projects 
as its agreements at facilities it owns begin to expire  covanta energy intends to seek replacement or additional contracts for waste supplies 
because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time  covanta energy believes it will be able to offer disposal services at rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste and provide acceptable revenues 
covanta energy will seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
at covanta energy s domestic facilities  the expiration of existing energy sales contracts will require covanta energy to sell project energy output either into the electricity grid or pursuant to new contracts 
there can be no assurance that covanta will be able to enter into such renewals  replacement or additional contracts  or that the terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to covanta energy 
for additional information regarding contract expiration dates  see item business 
waste to energy project ownership covanta energy operates many publicly owned waste to energy facilities and owns and operates many other facilities 
in addition  as a result of acquisitions of additional projects originally owned or operated by other vendors  covanta energy operates several projects under a lease structure where a third party lessor owns the project 
regardless of ownership structure  covanta energy provides the same service to its municipal client or customers 
under any of these ownership structures  the municipalities typically borrow funds to pay for the facility construction by issuing bonds 
in a private ownership structure  the municipal entity loans the bond proceeds to covanta energy s project subsidiary  and the facility is recorded as an asset  and the project debt is recorded 
table of contents as a liability  on covanta energy s consolidated balance sheet 
in a public ownership structure  the municipality would fund the construction costs without loaning the bond proceeds to covanta energy 
at all projects where a service fee structure exists regardless of ownership structure  covanta energy s municipal clients are generally responsible contractually for paying the project debt after construction is complete 
at the publicly owned service fee projects covanta energy operates  the municipality pays periodic debt service directly to a trustee under an indenture 
covanta energy owns projects where a service fee structure exists  and at these projects the municipal client pays debt service as a component of a monthly service fee payment to covanta energy 
the debt service payment is retained by a trustee  and is not held or available to covanta energy for general use 
at these projects  covanta energy records on its consolidated financial statements revenue with respect to debt service both principal and interest on project debt  and interest expense on project debt 
for covanta energy owned projects  all cash held by trustees is recorded as restricted funds held in trust on its consolidated balance sheet 
covanta energy owns or leases projects where a tip fee structure exists and neither debt service nor lease rent is expressly included in the fee covanta energy is paid 
accordingly  covanta energy does not record revenue reflecting principal on this project debt or on lease rent 
its operating subsidiaries for these projects make equal monthly deposits with their respective project trustees in amounts sufficient for the trustees to pay principal and interest  or lease rent  when due 
the term of covanta energy s operating contracts with its municipal clients generally coincides with the term of the bonds issued to pay for the project construction 
therefore  another important difference between public and private ownership of covanta energy s waste to energy projects is project ownership after these contracts expire 
in many cases  the municipality has contractual rights not obligations to extend the contract 
if a contract is not extended on a publicly owned project  covanta energy s role  and its revenue  with respect to that project would cease 
if a contract is not extended on a covanta energy owned project  it would be free to enter into new revenue generating contracts for waste supply with the municipality  other municipalities  or private waste haulers and for electricity or steam sales 
covanta energy would in such cases have no remaining project debt to repay from project revenue  and would be entitled to retain of energy sales revenue 
other factors affecting performance covanta energy has historically performed its operating obligations without experiencing material unexpected service interruptions or incurring material increases in costs 
in addition  with respect to many of its contracts at domestic projects  covanta energy generally has limited its exposure for risks not within its control 
with respect to projects acquired in the arc holdings acquisition  covanta energy has assumed contracts where there is less contractual protection against such risks and more exposure to market influences 
for additional information about such risks and damages that covanta energy may owe for its unexcused operating performance failures  see the risk factors set forth under the sub heading item a 
risk factors waste and energy services business 
in monitoring and assessing the ongoing operating and financial performance of covanta energy s businesses  management focuses on certain key factors tons of waste processed  electricity and steam sold  and boiler availability 
covanta energy s ability to meet or exceed historical levels of performance at projects  and its general financial performance  is affected by the following seasonal or long term changes in market prices for waste  energy  or scrap metals  for projects where covanta energy sells into those markets  seasonal  geographic and other variations in the heat content of waste processed  and thereby the amount of waste that can be processed by a waste to energy facility  its ability to avoid unexpected increases in operating and maintenance costs while ensuring that adequate facility maintenance is conducted so that historic levels of operating performance can be sustained  
table of contents contract counterparties ability to fulfill their obligations  including the ability of covanta energy s various municipal customers to supply waste in contractually committed amounts  and the availability of alternate or additional sources of waste if excess processing capacity exists at covanta energy s facilities  and the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover losses from business interruption in the event of casualty or other insured events 
general financial performance at cpih s international projects is affected by the following changes in fuel price for projects in which such costs are not completely passed through to the electricity purchaser through revenue adjustments  or delays in the effectiveness of revenue adjustments  the amounts of electricity actually requested by purchasers of electricity  and whether or when such requests are made  cpih s facilities are then available to deliver such electricity  cpih s ability to avoid unexpected increases in operating and maintenance costs while ensuring that adequate facility maintenance is conducted so that historic levels of operating performance can be sustained  the financial condition and creditworthiness of purchasers of power and services provided by cpih  fluctuations in the value of the domestic currency against the value of the us dollar for projects in which cpih is paid in whole or in part in the domestic currency of the host country  and political risks inherent to the international business which could affect both the ability to operate the project in conformance with existing agreements and the repatriation of dividends from the host country 
business development covanta s opportunities for growth by investing in new development opportunities will be limited by covanta energy s debt covenants  as well as by competition from other companies in the waste disposal and energy businesses 
covanta energy s business is capital intensive since it is based upon building and operating municipal solid waste processing and energy generating projects 
in order to provide meaningful growth  covanta must be able to invest its own funds  obtain equity or debt financing  and provide support to its operating subsidiaries 
covanta s domestic project development has recently concentrated on working with its client communities to expand existing waste to energy project capacities  and it has one project in advanced stages of development and another under construction 
covanta is pursuing additional project expansion opportunities  as well as opportunities in businesses ancillary to its existing business  such as additional waste transfer  transportation  processing and landfill businesses 
covanta is also pursuing international waste and or energy business opportunities  particularly in markets where the regulatory environment or other factors encourage technologies such as waste to energy in order to reduce dependence on landfilling  such as italy  where covanta has an existing presence  as well as the united kingdom 
other services covanta s other services segment is comprised of the parent company and insurance subsidiaries operations 
parent company operations prior to the acquisition of covanta energy on march   primarily included general and administrative expense related to officer salaries  legal and other professional fees and insurance 
subsequent to the acquisition of covanta energy  these expenses have been reimbursed by covanta energy under a corporate services agreement 
the parent company operations also include income earned on its investments 
the operations of covanta s insurance subsidiary  national american insurance company of california naicc  and its subsidiary valor insurance company  incorporated valor  are primarily property and casualty insurance 
based upon the profitability of its insurance lines  naicc has responded to expand  
table of contents contract or cease issuing certain of its insurance policies 
for example  effective july  the decision was made to focus exclusively on the california non standard personal automobile insurance market 
in contrast  in november  naicc ended a self imposed moratorium and commenced writing a new non standard automobile program under a new rate and class plan 
naicc  from time to time  has also entered into a quota share reinsurance agreement based upon its view of underwriting risk  its reserves and internal cost structure  in order to reduce its potential exposure to outstanding policies 
as a result of declining net premium production  naicc s investment base has steadily declined  its reserve adjustments on discontinued lines have disproportionately impacted current operating ratios and it continues to lose operating leverage 
as a result of positive results in the non standard automobile program in despite soft market conditions  naicc cancelled the reinsurance programs effective january  in an attempt to retain more net premium 
results of operations as discussed above  covanta combined the previously separate business segments of its insurance operations and its parent only operations into one reportable segment referred to as other services during the third quarter of therefore  covanta currently has two reportable business segments waste and energy services and other services 
the results of operations for the years ended december  and are not representative of covanta s ongoing results since covanta only included covanta energy s and arc holdings results of operations in its consolidated results of operations from march  and june  forward  respectively 
therefore  given the significance of the covanta energy and arc holdings acquisition to covanta s current and future results of operations and financial condition  covanta believes that an understanding of its reported results  trends and ongoing performance is enhanced by presenting results on a pro forma basis at both the consolidated and waste and energy services segment levels 
covanta s consolidated and segment results of operations  as reported and where applicable  on a pro forma basis  are summarized in the tables and discussions below 
the pro forma basis presentation assumes that the acquisitions of covanta energy and arc holdings both occurred on january  the pro forma adjustments are described on page the pro forma financial information is presented for information purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of each period or that may result in the future 
in addition  the pro forma information provided below has not been adjusted to reflect any operating efficiencies that may be realized as a result of the arc holdings acquisition 
the comparability of the information provided below with respect to covanta s revenue  expense and certain other items for periods during each of the years presented was affected materially by several factors in addition to the covanta energy and arc holdings acquisitions 
these factors principally include the exclusion of revenue and expense after may relating to the operations of the philippines magellan project mci facility  which commenced a reorganization proceeding under philippine law on may   and is no longer included as a consolidated subsidiary after such date  the reduction of revenue and expense after august relating to the philippines edison bataan facility  which ceased operations due to the expiration and termination of energy contracts  and the emergence of the remaining debtors involved in the lake county  florida and warren county  new jersey waste to energy facilities from bankruptcy on december  and december   respectively  and their inclusion as consolidated subsidiaries since their respective emergence dates 
the factors noted above must be taken into account in developing meaningful comparisons between the periods compared below

table of contents waste and energy services results due to the significance of the acquisition of arc holdings in june and covanta energy in march  and covanta energy s restructuring upon emergence from chapter proceedings in  covanta has elected to provide only a tabular presentation of its waste and energy services segment s actual results of operations from march  to december   in lieu of a discussion of covanta energy s results of operations comparing december  to december  since covanta did not have any waste and energy operations in  covanta believes that a discussion of the waste and energy services segment that compared to would not enhance a reader s analysis or understanding of covanta s current business 
therefore  the reader is further directed to covanta s pro forma management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the periods december  compared to for a comprehensive analysis and discussion of its waste and energy services segment

table of contents net earned premiums were million and million for the years ended and the significant decrease in earned premiums was a direct result of covanta s insurance business exiting the commercial automobile market in net written premiums were million for consisting entirely of non standard personal automobile policies 
net investment income was million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the fixed income portfolio basis  as well as a reduction in the portfolio yield 
the fixed income invested assets portfolio decreased by only million in despite net loss and lae reserves declining by million 
the differential was a result of management s use of cash and short term investments to satisfy the payment obligations 
due to the decrease in net written premiums on business placed in run off noted above  naicc also experienced negative underwriting cash flows 
for the years ended and  the weighted average yield on the bond portfolio was and  respectively 
the effective duration of the portfolio at december  was years which management believed was appropriate given the relative short tail nature of the auto programs and projected run off of all other lines of business 
net realized investment gains of million were recognized in compared to million in the difference in activity was attributed to management engaging new investment advisors in june to rebalance the portfolio to address extension  credit and reinvestment risk exposures 
concurrently  an improvement in equity investment returns and realizations in provided for improved gains 
for  although interest rates remained at relatively low historical levels  thereby limiting returns  improved matching of portfolio asset maturity to claims payment requirements reduced the amount of disposition activity 
the net loss and lae ratios were in and in the decrease in the loss and lae ratio during was attributable to much more stable development activity on prior accident years 
although commercial automobile  assumed property and casualty  and valor workers compensation reserves continued to generate unfavorable claim development  the non standard personal automobile and california workers compensation lines performed better than anticipated 
the non standard personal automobile loss and allocated lae alae ratio was for accident year versus for accident year recorded in calendar year the accident year loss and alae ratio declined to by year end 
non standard personal automobile claim frequency was and per vehicle months for accident years and  respectively 
claim severity in trended favorably for the non standard personal automobile policies decreasing by from the prior year 
meanwhile average premiums per vehicle on the non standard personal automobile remained constant  despite a shift in the mix of business moving towards non owner policies in versus in 
historically  the non owner policies loss and alae provided to lower yields than owner policies 
workers compensation reforms were enacted in california in late and again in april the reforms were designed to curb medical cost spending and resulted in more favorable settlement activity 
although the reforms did not eliminate systemic abuse  they did appear to have modified the behavior of claimants  providers and applicant attorneys 
as such  management was able to recognize favorable development within the workers compensation line in the amount of million in policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net earned premiums were in and in policy acquisition costs include expenses which are directly related to premium volume ie  commissions  premium taxes and state assessments  as well as certain underwriting expenses which vary with and are directly related to policy issuance 
the increase in policy acquisition costs was a result of profit commissions earned by the agent responsible for the marketing  underwriting and policy administration of the non standard personal automobile program 
the recognition of the profit commission was a direct result of favorable reserve development recognized on accident year and slightly improved results for accident year for the insurance business  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in in  management recognized additional pension expense of million related to participants electing to receive lump sum distributions of the pension plan and severance costs of million related to the outsourcing of its workers compensation claims 
in  additional allowance for uncollectible 
table of contents reinsurance recoverable of million and million in employee severance expenses related to business contraction inflated normal expenses 
normalizing both years for items noted  general and administrative expenses decreased by million 
management continues to examine its expense structure  however  given the decreases in premium production and its obligation to run off several lines of business  a core amount of fixed governance costs is required and consequently its expense ratio will run higher than industry averages until it can increase premium production 
for the parent company  covanta s expenses were primarily the result of the corporate services agreement between covanta and covanta energy  pursuant to which covanta provided to covanta energy  at covanta energy s expense  certain administrative and professional services and covanta energy pays most of covanta s expenses 
such expenses totaled million for the period march  through december  in addition  covanta and covanta energy entered into an agreement pursuant to which covanta energy provided  at covanta s expense  payroll and benefit services for covanta employees  which totaled million for the period march  through december  
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of liquidity and capital resources the information set forth below regarding liquidity and capital resources is presented according to covanta s consolidated operations and covanta s current business segments of waste and energy services and other services 
capital resources and commitments as part of the arc holdings acquisition  covanta energy entered into new credit arrangements which totaled approximately billion and are guaranteed by covanta and certain domestic subsidiaries of covanta energy 
the proceeds of the new financing arrangements were used to fund the acquisition of arc holdings  to refinance approximately million of covanta energy s and cpih s recourse debt and letter of credit facilities  and to pay the related fees and expenses 
the new credit facilities are further available for ongoing permitted expenditures and for general corporate purposes 
the following chart summarizes the various components and amounts of covanta energy s project and intermediate debt and credit facilities as of december  in millions of dollars graph 
table of contents cash flow and liquidity summary covanta s sources of funds are its investments and financing activities  as well as dividends  if any  and other payments received from covanta energy and naicc 
various state insurance requirements restrict the amounts that may be transferred to covanta in the form of dividends or loans from covanta s insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval 
currently  naicc cannot pay dividends or make loans to covanta 
under its new financing arrangements  covanta energy s ability to pay dividends to covanta is limited  except in certain circumstances 
the following summarizes the actual inflows and outflows relating to the arc holdings rights offering in millions of dollars proceeds from arc holdings rights offering transfers to covanta energy to fund a portion of arc holdings purchase price warrant agent and other costs net cash inflow to covanta summarized cash flow information for covanta s current business segments reconciled to the consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows in thousands of dollars for the year ended december  waste and energy other eliminations total net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended december  waste and energy other eliminations total net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents waste and energy services is net of cash acquired of arc holdings of other is net of cash acquired of covanta energy  at parent level of waste and energy services segment cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to the arc holdings acquisition 
net cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december  and was primarily due to the purchase of arc holdings  net of acquired cash 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and was primarily driven by the 
table of contents capital contribution from covanta  the net impact of the refinancing of the prior long term debt and for the acquisition of arc holdings offset partially by the payment and future funding of project debt 
restricted funds held in trust were million as of december  restricted funds held in trust are primarily amounts received and held by third party trustees relating to projects owned by covanta energy  and which may be used only for specified purposes 
these payments are made directly to the trustee primarily for related project debt and are held by it until paid to project debt holders 
covanta does not have access to these funds 
in addition  as of december   covanta had million in cash held in restricted accounts to pay for additional bankruptcy emergence expenses that are estimated to be paid in the future 
cash held in such reserve accounts is not available for general corporate purposes 
generating sufficient cash to meet covanta energy s liquidity needs  pay down its debt and invest in its business remains an important objective of management 
maintaining historic facility production levels while effectively managing operating and maintenance expenses is important to optimize covanta energy s long term cash generation 
covanta energy does not expect to receive any cash contributions from covanta and is prohibited under its principal financing arrangements from using its cash to issue dividends to covanta except in limited circumstances 
covanta energy derives its cash flow principally from its domestic and international project operations and businesses 
the frequency and predictability of covanta energy s receipt of cash from projects differs  depending upon various factors  including whether restrictions on distributions exist in applicable project debt arrangements or in debt arrangements at covanta energy s intermediate level subsidiaries  whether a project is domestic or international  and whether a project has been able to operate at historical levels of production 
a material portion of covanta energy s domestic cash flows are expected to be derived from projects where financial tests and other covenants contained in respective debt arrangements must be satisfied in order for project subsidiaries to make cash distributions to intermediate covanta energy subsidiaries  and for such intermediate level subsidiaries to make cash distributions to covanta energy 
distributions from these intermediate level subsidiaries may only be made quarterly  if such financial tests and other covenants are satisfied 
historically all such financial tests and covenants have been satisfied 
covanta energy s remaining domestic projects generally are not restricted in making cash distributions  and no restrictions exist at intermediate covanta energy subsidiary levels 
as a result  covanta energy generally receives cash from these projects on a monthly basis 
covanta energy s receipt of cash from its international projects is also subject to satisfaction of financial tests and other covenants contained in applicable project debt arrangements 
a material portion of cash distributions from covanta energy s international projects are received semi annually  during the second and fourth quarters 
in addition  risks inherent in international operations can affect the reliability of such cash distributions 
covanta believes that when combined with its other sources of liquidity  covanta energy s operations generate sufficient cash to meet operational needs  capital expenditures  and service debt due prior to maturity 
management will also seek to enhance covanta energy s cash flow from renewals or replacement of existing contracts  from new contracts to expand existing facilities or operate additional facilities and by investing in new projects 
covanta energy s new financing arrangements place certain restrictions on its ability to make investments in new projects or expansions of existing projects 
as previously announced  covanta agreed as part of the covanta energy acquisition to conduct the offering 
also as previously announced  because of the possibility that the offering could not be completed prior to the completion of the arc holdings rights offering  covanta restructured the offering to offer an additional million shares of covanta s common stock at the same purchase price as in the arc holdings rights offering 
on february   covanta completed the offering in which  shares were issued for million in gross proceeds

interest payments and letter of credit fees are estimated based on current rates 
retirement plan obligations are based on actuarial estimates for the defined contribution plan  pension plan obligations and post retirement plan obligations as of december  
table of contents other commitments covanta s other commitments as of december  were as follows in thousands of dollars commitments expiring by period less than more than total one year one year letters of credit surety bonds total other commitments net the letters of credit were issued pursuant to the funded l c facility and for one international project under a separate unsecured  letter of credit facility to secure covanta energy s performance under various contractual undertakings related to its domestic and international projects  or to secure obligations under its insurance program 
each letter of credit relating to a project is required to be maintained in effect for the period specified in related project contracts  and generally may be drawn if it is not renewed prior to expiration of that period 
some of these letters of credit reduce over time 
as of december   covanta energy had approximately million in available capacity for additional letters of credit under its funded l c facility and million under its revolving credit facility 
covanta energy believes that it will be able to fully perform its contracts to which these existing letters of credit relate  and that it is unlikely that letters of credit would be drawn because of a default of its performance obligations 
if any of covanta energy s letters of credit were to be drawn under its current debt facilities  the amount drawn would be immediately repayable to the issuing bank 
if covanta energy were unable to immediately repay such amounts drawn under letters of credit  unreimbursed amounts would be treated under the credit facilities as additional term loans issued under the first lien facilities 
the surety bonds listed on the table above primarily relate to assumed contracts from arc holdings million and possible closure costs for various energy projects when such projects cease operating million 
were these bonds to be drawn upon  covanta energy would have a contractual obligation to indemnify the surety company 
covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued or are party to performance guarantees and related contractual support obligations undertaken mainly pursuant to agreements to construct and operate certain waste to energy and water facilities 
with respect to its domestic businesses  covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued guarantees to municipal clients and other parties that covanta energy s subsidiaries will perform in accordance with contractual terms  including  where required  the payment of damages or other obligations 
such contractual damages or other obligations could be material  and in circumstances where one or more subsidiary s contract has been terminated for its default  such damages could include amounts sufficient to repay project debt 
for facilities owned by municipal clients and operated by covanta energy  covanta energy s potential maximum liability as of december  associated with the repayment of the municipalities project debt on such facilities was in excess of billion 
this amount was not recorded as a liability in covanta energy s consolidated balance sheet as of december  as covanta energy believes that it had not incurred such liability at the date of the financial statements 
additionally  damages payable under such guarantees on covanta energy owned waste to energy facilities could expose covanta energy to recourse liability on project debt shown on the foregoing table 
covanta energy also believes that it has not incurred such damages at the date of the financial statements 
if covanta energy is asked to perform under one or more of such guarantees  its liability for damages upon contract termination would be reduced by funds held in trust and proceeds from sales of the facilities securing the project debt  which is presently not estimable 
with respect to its international businesses  covanta energy has issued guarantees of certain of cpih s operating subsidiaries contractual obligations to operate power projects 
the potential damages owed under such arrangements for international projects may be material 
see item a 
risk factors waste and energy 
table of contents services business specific risks covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have provided guarantees and support in connection with its subsidiaries projects 
depending upon the circumstances giving rise to such domestic and international damages  the contractual terms of the applicable contracts  and the contract counterparty s choice of remedy at the time a claim against a guarantee is made  the amounts owed pursuant to one or more of such guarantees could be greater than covanta energy s then available sources of funds 
to date  covanta energy has not incurred material liabilities under its guarantees  either on domestic or international projects 
insurance coverage covanta has obtained insurance for covanta s assets and operations that provides coverage for what covanta believes are probable maximum losses  subject to self insured retentions  policy limits and premium costs which covanta believes to be appropriate 
however  the insurance obtained does not cover covanta for all possible losses 
off balance sheet arrangements subsidiaries of covanta energy are parties to lease arrangements with covanta energy s municipal clients at its union county  new jersey  its alexandria  virginia and its delaware county  pennsylvania waste to energy facilities 
at its union county facility  covanta energy s operating subsidiary leases the facility from the union county utilities authority  referred to as the ucua  under a lease that expires in  which covanta energy may extend for an additional five years 
covanta energy guarantees a portion of the rent due under the lease 
rent under the lease is sufficient to allow the ucua to repay tax exempt bonds issued by it to finance the facility and which mature in at its alexandria facility  a covanta energy subsidiary is a party to a lease related to certain pollution control equipment that was required in connection with the clean air act amendments of  and which was financed by the city of alexandria and by arlington county  virginia 
covanta energy s subsidiary owns this facility  and rent under this lease is sufficient to pay debt service on tax exempt bonds issued to finance such equipment and which mature in at its delaware valley facility  a covanta energy subsidiary is a party to a lease with the delaware county solid waste authority  known as dcswa  for the facility that expires in covanta energy s operating subsidiary  referred to as the delaware partnership  is obligated to pay a portion of lease rent  designated as basic rent b  and could be liable to pay certain related contractually specified amounts  referred to as stipulated loss  in the event of a default in the payment of rent under the delaware valley lease beyond the applicable grace period 
the stipulated loss is similar to lease termination liability and is generally intended to provide the lessor with the economic value of the lease  for the remaining lease term  had the default in rent payment not occurred 
the balance of rental and stipulated loss obligations are payable by a trust formed and collateralized by the project s former operator in connection with the disposition of its interest in the delaware valley facility 
pursuant to the terms of various guarantee agreements  arc has guaranteed the payments of basic rent b and stipulated loss to the extent such payments are not made by the delaware partnership 
covanta does not believe  however  that such payments constitute a material obligation of covanta s subsidiary since covanta s subsidiary expects to continue to operate the delaware valley facility in the ordinary course for the entire term of the lease and will continue to pay rent throughout the term of the lease 
as of december   the estimated stipulated loss would have been million 
covanta energy is also a party to lease arrangements pursuant to which it leases rolling stock in connection with its waste to energy and independent power facilities  as well as certain office equipment 
rent payable under these arrangements is not material to covanta energy s financial condition 
covanta energy generally uses operating lease treatment for all of the foregoing arrangements 
a summary of covanta energy s operating lease obligations is contained in note leases of the notes 
as described above under other commitments  covanta energy and certain of its subsidiaries have issued or are party to performance guarantees and related contractual obligations undertaken mainly pursuant 
table of contents to agreements to construct and operate certain energy and waste facilities 
to date  covanta energy has not incurred material liabilities under its guarantees  either on domestic or international projects 
covanta energy has investments in several investees and joint ventures which are accounted for under the equity and cost methods and therefore does not consolidate the financial information of those companies 
see note equity in net income loss from unconsolidated investments of the notes for additional information regarding these leases 
other services segment for the year ended december   covanta  on a parent only basis  held cash and investments of approximately million  of which million was available to pay general corporate expenses and for general working capital purposes 
covanta is required to maintain a separate cash fund of approximately million to provide potential liquidity to its insurance business 
cash deposited for this purpose is restricted and is not available for general corporate expenses or for working capital requirements 
covanta  through its subsidiaries  had an investment in acl warrants that were given by certain of the former creditors of acl 
in october  covanta converted the acl warrants into shares of acl common stock and subsequently sold the shares for net proceeds of approximately million 
see note financial instruments of the notes for further information 
covanta received net proceeds from the arc holdings rights offering of million and contributed approximately million to covanta energy to fund a portion of the million cash purchase price for the outstanding shares in arc holdings 
during  a subsidiary of covanta liquidated its interest in acl warrants as described in note financial instruments of the notes 
a portion of the warrant proceeds were paid to naicc to redeem an approximate interest held by naicc in such subsidiary 
naicc received net proceeds of approximately million 
cash used in operations from the insurance business was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the ongoing use of cash in operations was due to the insurance business continuing to make payments related to discontinued lines and territories in excess of premium receipts from existing lines 
this negative cash flow restricted the insurance business from fully re investing bond maturity proceeds and in some circumstances required the sale of bonds in order to meet obligations as they arose 
cash provided from investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the comparable period in the million increase in cash provided by investing activities in was due to a reduction in reinvestment activity in conjunction with reduced premium production 
there were no financing activities in either twelve month period ended december  and covanta s insurance business  which comprises a portion of covanta s other services segment  requires both readily liquid assets and adequate capital to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders and claimants  as well as to pay ordinary operating expenses 
the insurance business meets both its short term and long term liquidity requirements through operating cash flows that include premium receipts  investment income and reinsurance recoveries 
to the extent operating cash flows do not provide sufficient cash flow  the insurance business relies on the sale of invested assets 
its investment policy guidelines require that all loss and lae liabilities be matched by a comparable amount of investment grade assets 
covanta believes that the insurance business has both adequate capital resources and sufficient reinsurance to meet its current operating requirements 
the national association of insurance commissioners provides minimum solvency standards in the form of risk based capital requirements rbc 
the rbc model for property and casualty insurance companies requires that carriers report their rbc ratios based on their statutory annual statements as filed with the regulatory authorities 
covanta believes covanta s insurance business has projected its rbc requirement as of december  under the rbc model and believes that it is above the level which would trigger increased oversight by regulators 

table of contents covanta estimates its insurance business reserves for unpaid losses and lae based on reported losses and historical experience  including losses reported by other insurance companies for reinsurance assumed  and estimates of expenses for investigating and adjusting all incurred and unadjusted claims 
key assumptions used in the estimation process could have significant effects on the reserve balances 
covanta s insurance business regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions based on historical experience adjusted for current economic conditions and trends 
changes in the unpaid losses and lae can materially affect the statement of operations 
california and montana insurance laws and regulations regulate the amount and type of naicc s investments 
naicc s investment portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed maturities and is weighted heavily toward investment grade short and medium term securities

naicc had pledged assets of million and had letters of credit outstanding of million as of december  covanta s insurance business contractual commitments under operating lease agreements total approximately million as of december  and are due as follows million in  million in each year from through and million thereafter 
discussion of critical accounting policies in preparing its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  covanta is required to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in its financial statements and related notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
many of covanta s critical accounting policies are those subject to significant judgments and uncertainties which could potentially result in materially different results under different conditions and assumptions 
future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
purchase accounting covanta applied purchase accounting in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
business combinations  for its acquisitions in and as described in note acquisitions and dispositions of the notes  covanta 
table of contents valued the acquired assets and liabilities assumed at fair value 
the estimates of fair value used by covanta reflect its best estimates based on the work of covanta and independent valuation consultants and  where such work has not been completed  such estimates have been based on covanta s experience and relevant information available to management 
these estimates  and the assumptions used by covanta and by its valuation consultants  are subject to inherent uncertainties and contingencies beyond covanta s control 
for example  covanta used the discounted cash flow method to estimate value of many of its assets 
this entails developing projections about future cash flows and adopting an appropriate discount rate 
covanta cannot predict with certainty actual cash flows and the selection of a discount rate is heavily dependent on judgment 
if different cash flow projections or discount rates were used  the fair values of covanta s assets and liabilities could be materially increased or decreased 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions reflected in the valuations will be realized  or that further adjustments will not occur 
the assumptions and estimates used by covanta therefore have substantial effect on covanta s balance sheet 
in addition because the valuations impact depreciation and amortization  changes in such assumptions and estimates may affect earnings in the future 
during the current year  some of covanta s estimates have been refined and have resulted in changes to assets and liabilities recognized in the balance sheet 
depreciation and amortization covanta has estimated the useful lives over which it depreciates its long lived assets 
additionally  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  covanta energy has capitalized the estimate of covanta s legal liabilities which includes capping  closure and post closure costs of landfill cells and site restoration for certain waste to energy and power producing sites 
goodwill and intangible assets covanta energy has recognized goodwill and intangible assets relative to its acquisition of arc holdings and its emergence from bankruptcy in in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  covanta evaluates its goodwill and nonamortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when indications of impairment exist 
the impact of recognizing an impairment could have a material impact on financial position and results of operations 
there has been no impairment recognized in the current year  however an impact of impairment in the future could have a material impact on the financial position and results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  covanta evaluates its long term assets and amortizable intangible assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
no events or change in circumstances occurred during the period to warrant this testing 
however  had an event or change in circumstances occurred  the impact of recognizing an impairment could have a material impact on financial position and results of operations 
net operating loss carryforwards deferred tax assets as described in note income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  covanta has recorded a deferred tax asset related to the nols 
the amount recorded was calculated based upon future taxable income arising from a the reversal of temporary differences during the period the nols are available and b future operating income expected from covanta s domestic and international businesses  to the extent it is reasonably predictable 
covanta cannot be certain that the nols will be available to offset the tax liability of covanta 
if the nols were not available to offset the tax liability of covanta  covanta may not have sufficient cash flow available to pay debt service on the credit facilities described above under cash flow and liquidity 
covanta estimated that it had nols of approximately million for federal income tax purposes as of the end of the nols will expire in various amounts beginning on december  through december   if not used 
the amount of nols available to covanta will be reduced by any taxable 
table of contents income generated by current members of covanta s tax consolidated group including certain grantor trusts relating to the mission insurance entities 
the internal revenue service irs has not audited any of covanta s tax returns for the years in which the losses giving rise to the nols were reported  and it could challenge any past and future use of the nols 
under applicable tax law  the use and availability of covanta s nols could be limited if there is a more than increase in stock ownership during a year testing period by stockholders owning or more of covanta s stock 
covanta s certificate of incorporation contains stock transfer restrictions that were designed to help preserve covanta s nols by avoiding such an ownership change 
covanta expects that the restrictions will remain in force as long as covanta has nols 
there can be no assurance  however  that these restrictions will prevent such an ownership change 
loss contingencies as described in note commitments and contingent liabilities of the notes  covanta s subsidiaries are party to a number of claims  lawsuits and pending actions  most of which are routine and all of which are incidental to its business 
covanta assesses the likelihood of potential losses with respect to these matters on an ongoing basis and when losses are considered probable and reasonably estimable  records as a loss an estimate of the ultimate outcome 
if covanta can only estimate the range of a possible loss  an amount representing the low end of the range of possible outcomes is recorded and disclosure is made regarding the possibility of additional losses 
covanta reviews such estimates on an ongoing basis as developments occur with respect to such matters and may in the future increase or decrease such estimates 
there can be no assurance that covanta s initial or adjusted estimates of losses will reflect the ultimate loss covanta may experience regarding such matters 
any inaccuracies could potentially have a material adverse effect on covanta s consolidated financial condition 
financial instruments as described in note financial instruments of the notes  the estimated fair value amounts have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is necessarily required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value 
accordingly the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that covanta would realize in a current market exchange 
for cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  and marketable securities  the carrying value of these amounts is a reasonable estimate of their fair value 
the fair value of long term unbilled receivables is estimated by using a discount rate that approximates the current rate for comparable notes 
the fair value of noncurrent receivables is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to such borrowers based on the remaining maturities  consideration of credit risks  and other business issues pertaining to such receivables 
the fair value of restricted funds held in trust is based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the trustee 
fair values for debt were determined based on interest rates that are currently available to covanta for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities for debt issues that are not traded on quoted market prices 
the fair value of project debt is estimated based on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues 
the fair value of covanta s interest rate swap agreements is the estimated amount covanta would receive or pay to terminate the agreement based on the net present value of the future cash flows as defined in the agreement 
revenue recognition covanta energy earns fees to service project debt principal and interest where such fees are expressly included as a component of the service fee paid by the client community pursuant to applicable waste to 
table of contents energy service agreements 
regardless of the timing of amounts paid by client communities relating to project debt principal  covanta energy records service revenue with respect to this principal component on a levelized basis over the term of the applicable service agreement 
unbilled service receivables related to waste to energy operations are discounted in recognizing the present value for services performed currently in order to service the principal component of the project debt 
such unbilled receivables amounted to million at december  fees for waste disposal are recognized in the period received 
revenue from electricity and steam sales are recorded when delivered at rates specified in the contracts 
covanta energy also earns fees under fixed price construction contracts  in which case revenue is accounted for using the percentage of completion of services rendered 
pensions covanta energy has defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans that cover substantially all of its employees 
the employees of arc holdings continued to be covered under their separate retirement savings plan until december  during the third quarter of  covanta froze the covanta energy defined benefit pension plan effective december  all active employees who were eligible participants in the covanta energy pension plan as of december   were vested and have a nonforfeitable right to this benefit at december  beginning january   all eligible employees will receive a company contribution into a new defined contribution retirement plan 
covanta energy recorded a pension plan liability equal to the amount by which the present value of the projected benefit obligations using a discount rate of exceeded the fair value of pension assets as of december  unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses the insurance subsidiaries establish loss and lae reserves that are estimates of amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses in the future for insured events that have already occurred 
the process of estimating reserves involves a considerable degree of judgment by management and  as of any given date  is inherently uncertain 
reserves are typically comprised of case reserves for claims reported and reserves for losses that have occurred but for which claims have not yet been reported  referred to as incurred but not reported ibnr reserves  which include a provision for expected future development on case reserves 
case reserves are estimated based on the experience and knowledge of claims staff regarding the nature and potential cost of each claim and are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ibnr reserves are derived by subtracting paid loss and lae and case reserves from estimates of ultimate loss and lae 
actuaries estimate ultimate loss and lae using various generally accepted actuarial methods applied to known losses and other relevant information 
like case reserves  ibnr reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes known or payments are made 
ultimate loss and lae are generally determined by extrapolation of claim emergence and settlement patterns observed in the past that can reasonably be expected to persist into the future 
in forecasting ultimate loss and lae with respect to any line of business  past experience with respect to that line of business is the primary resource  but cannot be relied upon in isolation 
the insurance businesses own experience  particularly claims development experience  such as trends in case reserves  payments on and closings of claims  as well as changes in business mix and coverage limits  are the most important information for estimating its reserves 
uncertainties in estimating ultimate loss and lae are magnified by the time lag between when a claim actually occurs and when it is reported and settled 
this time lag is sometimes referred to as the claim tail 
the claim tail for most property coverages is typically short usually a few days up to a few months 
the claim tail for automobile liability is relatively short usually one to two years and liability casualty coverages  such as general liability  multiple peril coverage  and workers compensation  can be especially long as claims are often reported and ultimately paid or settled years  even decades  after the related loss events occur 
during the long claims reporting and settlement period  additional facts regarding coverages written in prior 
table of contents accident years  as well as about actual claims and trends may become known and  as a result  the insurance subsidiaries may adjust their reserves 
if management determines that an adjustment is appropriate  the adjustment is booked in the accounting period in which such determination is made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
accordingly  should reserves need to be increased or decreased in the future from amounts currently established  future results of operations would be negatively or positively impacted  respectively 
the insurance subsidiaries use independent actuaries which it significantly relies on to form a conclusion on reserve estimates 
those independent actuaries use several generally accepted actuarial methods to evaluate the insurance business loss reserves  each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses 
the independent actuaries place more or less reliance on a particular method based on the facts and circumstances at the time the reserve estimates are made and through discussions with the insurance subsidiaries management

covanta obtained the financing for its acquisition of covanta energy pursuant to a note purchase agreement dated december   from the bridge lenders 
pursuant to the note purchase agreement  the bridge lenders provided covanta with million of bridge financing in exchange for notes issued by covanta 
covanta repaid the notes with the proceeds from a rights offering of common stock of covanta which was completed in june and in connection with the conversion of a portion of the note held by laminar into million shares of common stock of covanta pursuant to the note purchase agreement 
in consideration for the million of bridge financing and the arrangement by the bridge lenders of the

pursuant to registration rights agreements covanta filed a registration statement with the sec to register the shares of common stock issued to the bridge lenders under the note purchase agreement 
the registration statement was declared effective on august  as part of covanta s negotiations with laminar and it becoming a five percent stockholder  pursuant to a letter agreement dated december   laminar agreed to transfer restrictions on the shares of common stock that laminar acquired pursuant to the note purchase agreement 
further  in accordance with the transfer restrictions contained in article fifth of covanta s charter restricting the resale of covanta s common stock by five percent stockholders  covanta has agreed with laminar to provide it with limited rights to resell the common stock that it holds 
as of march   laminar was permitted to sell up to of covanta s outstanding shares  or all of the shares of covanta common stock then held by it 
also in connection with the financing for the acquisition of covanta energy  covanta agreed to pay up to million in the aggregate to the bridge lenders as reimbursement for expenses incurred by them in connection with the note purchase agreement 
the note purchase agreement and other transactions associated with the covanta energy acquisition involving sz investments  third avenue and laminar were negotiated  reviewed and approved by a special committee of covanta s board of directors composed solely of disinterested directors and advised by independent legal and financial advisors 
on january   covanta entered into a stock purchase agreement with arc holdings  and arc holdings stockholders to purchase the issued and outstanding shares of arc holdings capital stock 
under the terms of the stock purchase agreement  covanta paid million including transaction costs for the stock of arc holdings and assumed the consolidated net debt of arc holdings  which was approximately billion billion of consolidated indebtedness net of billion of cash and restricted cash  resulting in an enterprise value of approximately billion for arc holdings 
the transaction was completed on june  and arc holdings is now a wholly owned subsidiary of covanta energy 
covanta financed the purchase of arc holdings through a combination of debt and equity financing 
the equity component of the financing consisted of an approximate million offering of rights to purchase covanta s common stock to all of covanta s existing stockholders 
in the arc holdings rights offering  covanta s existing stockholders were issued rights to purchase covanta s stock on a pro rata basis  with each holder entitled to purchase shares of covanta s common stock at an exercise price of per full share for each share of covanta s common stock then held 
sz investments and its affiliate egi fund investors  llc  third avenue and laminar representing ownership of approximately of covanta s outstanding common stock  each separately committed to participate in the arc holdings rights offering and acquire their respective pro rata portion of the shares

covanta agreed to amend an existing registration rights agreement to provide these stockholders with the right to demand that covanta undertake an underwritten offering within twelve months of the closing of the acquisition of arc holdings in order to provide such stockholders with liquidity 
the equity commitments and related agreements involving sz investments  third avenue and laminar were negotiated  reviewed and approved by a special committee of covanta s board of directors composed solely of disinterested directors and advised by independent legal and financial advisors 
as part of the covanta energy acquisition  covanta agreed to and conducted the offering 
the offering was made solely to those holders of covanta energy s debentures which had been issued prior to its bankruptcy who had voted in favor of covanta energy s second reorganization plan on january  or were otherwise authorized to participate by the bankruptcy court

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  covanta s subsidiaries are party to financial instruments that are subject to market risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
covanta s use of derivative instruments is very limited and it does not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding covanta s exposure to financial instruments with market risks 
covanta uses a sensitivity model to evaluate the fair value or cash flows of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates and interest rate yield curves 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel manner and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of december  further information is included in note financial instruments of the notes 

table of contents waste and energy services interest rate risk covanta energy and or its subsidiaries have project debt outstanding bearing interest at floating rates that could subject it to the risk of increased interest expense due to rising market interest rates  or an adverse change in fair value due to declining interest rates on fixed rate debt 
of covanta energy s project debt  approximately million was floating rate debt at december  however  the entire interest rate risk related to the floating rate project debt is borne by the client communities because debt service is passed through to those clients under the contractual structure of their waste services agreements 
covanta energy had only one interest rate swap relating to project debt outstanding at december  in the notional amount of million related to floating rate project debt 
gains and losses  however  on this swap are for the account of the client community and are not borne by covanta energy 
as described in note long term debt of the notes  covanta energy is required to enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of its exposure to interest rate changes with respect to its borrowing under the credit facilities 
on july   covanta energy entered into two pay fixed  receive floating interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million 
these swaps were designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  unrealized gains or losses will be deferred in other comprehensive income until the hedged cash flows affect earnings 
covanta energy expects to enter into similar arrangements during for at least an additional million in notional amount 
for floating rate project debt  a percent hypothetical increase in the underlying december  market interest rates would result in a potential loss to twelve month future earnings of million 
for fixed rate project debt  the potential reduction in fair value from a percent hypothetical increase in the underlying december  market interest rates would be approximately million 
the fair value of covanta energy s fixed rate project debt including billion in fixed rate debt related to revenue bonds in which debt service is an explicit component of the service fees billed to the client communities was billion at december   and was determined using average market quotations of price and yields provided by investment banks 
foreign currency exchange rate risk covanta energy has investments in energy projects in various foreign countries  including the philippines  china  india and bangladesh  and to a much lesser degree  italy and costa rica 
neither covanta nor covanta energy enters into currency transactions to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
instead  covanta energy attempts to mitigate its currency risks by structuring its project contracts so that its revenues are adjusted in line with corresponding changes in currency rates 
therefore  only working capital and project debt denominated in other than a project entity s functional currency are exposed to currency risks 
at december   covanta energy had million of project debt related to two diesel engine projects in india 
for million of the debt related to project entities whose functional currency is the indian rupee  exchange rate fluctuations are recorded as translation adjustments in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity in covanta s consolidated balance sheets 
the remaining million of debt is denominated in us dollars 
the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a adverse change in december  quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
at december   covanta energy also had net investments in foreign subsidiaries and projects 
see note equity in net income loss from unconsolidated investments of the notes for further discussion 
commodity price risk and contract revenue risk neither covanta nor covanta energy has entered into futures  forward contracts  swaps or options to hedge purchase and sale commitments  fuel requirements  inventories or other commodities 
alternatively  
table of contents covanta energy attempts to mitigate the risk of energy and fuel market fluctuations by structuring contracts related to its energy projects in the manner described above under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview contract structures 
generally  covanta energy is protected against fluctuations in the waste disposal market  and thus its ability to charge acceptable fees for its services  through long term service agreements and disposal contracts at its waste to energy facilities 
at of its waste to energy facilities  differing amounts of waste disposal capacity are not subject to long term contracts and  therefore  covanta energy is partially exposed to the risk of market fluctuations in the waste disposal fees it may charge 
covanta energy s long term service agreements begin to expire in  and energy sales contracts at company owned projects generally expire at or after the date on which that project s long term agreement expires 
expiration of these contracts will subject covanta energy to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing its revenues 
as its agreements at municipally owned projects expire  covanta energy will seek to enter into renewal or replacement contracts to continue operating such projects 
as covanta energy s agreements at facilities it owns begin to expire  covanta energy intends to seek replacement or additional contracts for waste supplies  and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time  covanta energy expects to be able to offer disposal services at rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste and provide acceptable revenues 
covanta energy will seek to bid competitively in the market for additional contracts to operate other facilities as similar contracts of other vendors expire 
at company owned facilities  the expiration of existing energy sales contracts will require covanta energy to sell its output either into the local electricity grid or pursuant to new contracts 
there can be no assurance that covanta energy will be able to enter into such renewals  replacement or additional contracts  or that the price and other terms available in the market at the time will be favorable to covanta energy 
other services risk related to the investment portfolio naicc s objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and investment returns while minimizing overall market risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including duration of liabilities  underwriting results  overall tax position  regulatory requirements  and fluctuations in interest rates 
investment decisions are made by management  in consultation with an independent investment advisor  and approved by its board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of securities 
the market risks related to naicc s fixed maturity portfolio are primarily credit risk  interest rate risk  reinvestment risk and prepayment risk 
the market risk related to naicc s equity portfolio is price risk 
fixed maturities interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of fixed maturities to changes in interest rate 
management views these potential changes in price within the overall context of asset and liability matching 
management estimates the payout patterns of naicc s liabilities  primarily loss reserves  to determine their duration 
management sets duration targets for the fixed income portfolio after consideration of the duration of naicc s liabilities that it believes mitigates the overall interest rate risk 
naicc s exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated by the relative short term nature of its insurance and other liabilities 
the effective duration of the portfolio at december  and was years and years  respectively 
management believes its portfolio duration is appropriate given the relative short tail nature of the auto programs and projected run off of all other lines of business 
a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would cause an approximate decrease in the fair value of the portfolio while a hypothetical basis point decrease would cause an approximate increase in fair value 
credit risk is the price sensitivity of fixed maturities to changes in the credit quality of such investment 
naicc s exposure to credit risk is mitigated by its investment in high quality fixed income alternatives 
fixed maturities of naicc include mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations  collectively mbs representing and of total fixed maturities at december  and 
table of contents  respectively 
all mbs held by naicc are issued by the federal national mortgage association fnma or the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  which are both rated aaa by moody s investors services 
both fnma and fhlmc are corporations that were created by acts of congress 
fnma and fhlmc guarantee the principal balance of their securities 
fnma guarantees timely payment of principal and interest 
one of the risks associated with mbs is the timing of principal payments on the mortgages underlying the securities 
naicc attempts to limit repayment risk by purchasing mbs whose cost is below or does not significantly exceed par  and by primarily purchasing structured securities with repayment protection which provides more certain cash flow to the investor such as mbs with sinking fund schedules known as planned amortization classes pac and targeted amortization classes tac 
the structures of pac s and tac s attempt to increase the certainty of the timing of prepayment and thereby minimize the prepayment and interest rate risk 
in  naicc recognized less than million in loss on sales of fixed maturities 
mbs  as well as callable bonds  have a greater sensitivity to market value declines in a rising interest rate environment than to market value increases in a declining interest rate environment 
naicc realized significant increases in its prepayments of principal during and and to a lesser extent in the prepayments mitigated the need to sell securities to meet operating cash requirements as noted previously 
equity securities in the fourth quarter of  naicc sold nearly all of its equity investments capitalizing on the general stock market recovery and specifically the technology sector 
in  naicc recognized million as net realized gains from equity investments 
in third and fourth quarter of  naicc began reinvesting in equity securities  generally limited to fortune companies with strong balance sheets  history of dividend growth and price appreciation 
as of december   equity securities represented of the total naicc investment portfolio
