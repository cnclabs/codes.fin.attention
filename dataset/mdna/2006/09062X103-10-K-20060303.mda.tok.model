item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k  beginning on page f overview biogen idec creates new standards of care in oncology  neurology and immunology 
as a global leader in the development  manufacturing  and commercialization of novel therapies  we transform scientific discoveries into advances in human healthcare 
we currently have five products avonex interferon beta a 
avonex is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis  or ms  and is the most prescribed therapeutic product in ms worldwide 
globally over  patients have chosen avonex as their treatment of choice 
rituxan rituximab 
rituxan is approved worldwide for the treatment of relapsed or refractory low grade or follicular  cd positive  b cell non hodgkin s lymphomas  or nhls 
in february  rituxan was approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  to treat previously untreated patients with diffuse  large b cell nhl in combination with anthracycline based chemotherapy regimens 
in addition  in february  the fda approved the supplemental biologics license application  or sbla  for use of rituxan  in combination with methotrexate  for reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis  or ra  who have had an inadequate response to one or more tnf antagonist therapies 
we market rituxan in the united states  or us  in collaboration with genentech  inc  or genentech 
all us sales of rituxan are recognized by genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis 
roche sells rituxan outside the us  except in japan where it co markets rituxan in collaboration with zenyaku 
we are working with genentech and roche on the development of rituxan in additional oncology and other indications 
tysabri natalizumab 
tysabri was approved by the fda in november to treat relapsing forms of ms to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses 
in february  in consultation with the fda  we and elan corporation plc  or elan  voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri  and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of tysabri until further notification 
in addition  we suspended dosing in clinical studies of tysabri in ms  crohn s disease and ra 
these decisions were based on reports of cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  or pml  a rare and frequently fatal  demyelinating disease of the central nervous system  in patients treated with tysabri in clinical studies 
we and elan conducted a safety evaluation of patients treated with tysabri in ms  crohn s disease and ra clinical studies 
the safety evaluation included the review of any reports of potential pml in ms patients receiving tysabri in the commercial setting 
in october  we completed the safety evaluation of tysabri and found no new confirmed cases of pml 
three confirmed cases of pml were previously reported  two of which were fatal 
in september  we submitted an sbla for tysabri to the fda for the treatment of ms 
the sbla includes final two year data from the phase affirm monotherapy trial and sentinel combination trial with avonex in ms  the integrated safety assessment of patients treated with tysabri in clinical trials  and a revised label and a risk minimization action plan 
we and elan have also submitted a similar data package to the european medicines agency  or emea 
this information was supplied as part of the ongoing emea review process  which was initiated in the summer of with the filing for approval of tysabri as a treatment for ms 
in november  we were granted priority review status for the sbla  which will result in action by the fda approximately six months from the submission date  or by march in january  we and elan announced that we had received notification from the fda that the peripheral and central nervous system drugs advisory committee would review tysabri for the treatment of ms on march  in february  we and elan announced that the fda informed the companies that they removed the hold on clinical trial dosing of tysabri 
we and elan expect to begin an open label  multi center safety extension study of tysabri monotherapy in the us and internationally in the coming weeks 
we plan to work with regulatory authorities to determine the future commercial availability of tysabri

comprehensive strategic plan in september  we began implementing a comprehensive strategic plan designed to position us for long term growth 
the plan builds on the continuing strength of avonex and rituxan and other expected near term developments 
the plan has three principal elements reducing operating expenses and enhancing economic flexibility by recalibrating our asset base  geographic site missions  staffing levels and business processes  committing significant additional capital to external business development and research opportunities  and changing our organizational culture to enhance innovation and support the first two elements of the plan 
in conjunction with the plan  we consolidated or eliminated certain internal management layers and staff functions  resulting in the reduction of our workforce by approximately  or approximately positions worldwide 
these adjustments took place across company functions  departments and sites  and were substantially implemented 
in addition  we are seeking to divest several other non core assets  including amevive  our nico clinical manufacturing facility in oceanside  california and certain real property in oceanside  california 
our amevive assets held for sale include million related to intangible assets  net  and million for property  plant and equipment  net 
in february  we sold the nico clinical manufacturing facility in oceanside  california to genentech

unconsolidated joint business revenue rituxan is currently marketed and sold worldwide for the treatment of certain b cell nhls 
in february  rituxan was approved by the fda to treat previously untreated patients with diffuse  large b cell nhl in combination with anthracycline based chemotherapy regimens 
in addition  in february  the fda approved the sbla for use of rituxan  in combination with methotrexate  for reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with moderately to severely active ra who have had an inadequate response to one or more tnf antagonist therapies 
we copromote rituxan in the us in collaboration with genentech under a collaboration agreement between the parties 
under the collaboration agreement  we granted genentech a worldwide license to develop  commercialize and market rituxan in multiple indications 
in exchange for these worldwide rights  we have copromotion rights in the us and a contractual arrangement under which genentech shares a portion of the pretax us copromotion profits of rituxan with us 
this collaboration was created through a contractual arrangement  not through a joint venture or other legal entity 
in june  we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with genentech to include the development and commercialization of one or more anti cd antibodies targeting b cell disorders  in addition to rituxan  for a broad range of indications 
in the us  we contribute resources to selling and the continued development of rituxan 
genentech is responsible for worldwide manufacturing of rituxan 
genentech also is responsible for the primary support functions for the commercialization of rituxan in the us including selling and marketing  customer service  order entry  distribution  shipping and billing 
genentech also incurs the majority of continuing development costs for rituxan 
under the arrangement  we have a limited sales force as well as limited development activity 

table of contents under the terms of separate sublicense agreements between genentech and roche  commercialization of rituxan outside the us is the responsibility of roche  except in japan where roche copromotes rituxan in collaboration with zenyaku 
there is no direct contractual arrangement between us and roche or zenyaku 
revenue from unconsolidated joint business consists of our share of pretax copromotion profits which is calculated by genentech  and includes consideration of our rituxan related sales force and development expenses  and royalty revenue from sales of rituxan outside the us by roche and zenyaku 
copromotion profit consists of us sales of rituxan to third party customers net of discounts and allowances and less the cost to manufacture rituxan  third party royalty expenses  distribution  selling and marketing expenses  and joint development expenses incurred by genentech and us 
under the amended and restated collaboration agreement  our current pretax copromotion profit sharing formula  which resets annually  is as follows biogen idec s share copromotion operating profits of copromotion profits first million greater than million in  and  the threshold was met during the first quarter 
for each calendar year or portion thereof following the approval date of the first new anti cd product  the pretax copromotion profit sharing formula for rituxan and other anti cd products sold by us and genentech will change to the following new anti cd us biogen idec s share copromotion operating profits gross product sales of copromotion profits first million n a greater than million until such sales exceed million in any calendar year or after such sales exceed million in any calendar year and until such sales exceed million in any calendar year or after such sales exceed million in any calendar year not applicable in the calendar year the first new anti cd product is approved if million in copromotion operating profits has already been achieved in such calendar year through sales of rituxan 
if we are recording our share of rituxan copromotion profits at  upon the approval date of the first new anti cd product  our share of copromotion profits for rituxan and the new anti cd product will be immediately reduced to following the approval date of the first new anti cd product until the million new product sales level is achieved 
if million in new product sales is achieved in the same calendar year the first new anti cd product receives approval  then the copromotion profit sharing rate will not be effective until january of the following calendar year 
once the million new product sales level is achieved then our share of copromotion profits for the balance of the year and all subsequent years after the first million in copromotion operating profits in such years will be until the million new product sales level is achieved 
if million in new product sales is achieved in the same calendar year that million in new product sales is achieved  then the copromotion profit sharing rate will not be effective until january of the following calendar year or january of the second following calendar year if the first new anti cd product receives approval and  in the same calendar year  the million and million new product sales levels are achieved

the increase in royalty revenues in and is due to increased sales of rituxan outside the u 
s  which is offset by an million royalty credit to genentech in  which we expect to pay in under the amended and restated collaboration agreement  we will receive lower royalty revenue from genentech on sales by roche and zenyaku of new anti cd products  as compared to royalty revenue received on sales of rituxan 
the royalty period with respect to all products is years from the first commercial sale of such product on a country by country basis 
during  genentech purchased certain clinical data from roche that supported a potential label expansion of rituxan 
additionally  in  we  along with genentech  agreed that payments were owed to columbia university for royalties related to past sales of rituxan in the us as a result  we recognized million in royalty payments and million in interest charges related to these royalties 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business represented  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to is primarily due to former biogen  inc revenue included in our results of operations for all of and for the period of november  through december  royalty revenue we receive revenues from royalties on sales by our licensees of a number of products covered under patents that we control

we hold several important patents related to hepatitis b antigens produced by genetic engineering techniques 
these antigens are used in recombinant hepatitis b vaccines and in diagnostic test kits used to detect hepatitis b infection 
we receive royalties from sales of hepatitis b vaccines in several countries  including the us  from glaxosmithkline plc and merck and co 
inc we have also licensed our proprietary hepatitis b rights  on an antigen by antigen and nonexclusive basis  to several diagnostic kit manufacturers  including abbott laboratories  the major worldwide marketer of hepatitis b diagnostic kits 
we also receive ongoing royalties on sales of angiomax bivalirudin by the medicines company  or tmc 
tmc sells angiomax in the us for use as an anticoagulant in combination with aspirin in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty 
tmc sells angiomax through distributors in europe  canada and latin america 
we anticipate that total royalty revenues in will be consistent with our total royalty revenues in royalty revenues may fluctuate as a result of fluctuations in sales levels of products sold by our licensees from quarter to quarter due to the timing and extent of major events such as new indication approvals or government sponsored programs 
corporate partner revenues corporate partner revenues consist of contract revenues and license fees 
corporate partner revenues totaled million in compared to million in and million in corporate partner revenues represented less than of total revenues in  and in  we received a million payment from schering ag for the emea grant of marketing approval of zevalin in the eu

we plan to work with regulatory authorities to determine if dosing in ms and other clinical studies will be re initiated and the future commercial availability of the product 
we cannot predict the outcome of our work with regulatory authorities 
tysabri could be permanently withdrawn from the market or re introduced to the market with significant restrictions on its permissible uses  black box or other significant safety warnings in its label and such other restrictions  requirements and limitations as the fda  emea or other regulatory authorities may require 
while we presently believe that we will be able to find a path forward for tysabri  there are no assurances as to the likelihood of success 
in light of our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that our tysabri inventory would be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life  we wrote down all of the million of tysabri inventory that had been included on the balance sheet as of december   which was charged to cost of product revenues 
we manufactured tysabri during the first and second quarter of and completed our scheduled production of tysabri during july because of the uncertain future commercial availability of tysabri and our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that tysabri inventory will be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life  we expensed million of costs related to the manufacture of tysabri in the first quarter of to cost of product revenues 
at the time of production  the inventory was believed to be commercially saleable 
beginning in the second quarter of  as we were working with clinical investigators to understand the possible risks of pml  we charged the costs related to the manufacture of tysabri to research and development expense 
as a result  we expensed million related to the manufacture of tysabri to research and development expense during in the first quarter of  in light of our expectation that we will reintroduce of tysabri to the us market  we began a new manufacturing campaign for tysabri 
see item a 
risk factors safety issues with tysabri could significantly affect our growth 
we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if there are further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs may be required 
this periodic review led to the write downs of tysabri inventory as of december  and the expensing of tysabri during  as described above  and may lead us to expense tysabri in subsequent periods 

table of contents our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which we perform throughout the manufacturing process 
periodically  certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire 
as a result  included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration  in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value 
in  we wrote down million  million and million of unmarketable inventory related to amevive  avonex and zevalin  respectively  which was charged to cost of product revenues 
the write downs of amevive inventory consisted of million of expired product and million for product that failed to meet quality specifications 
the write downs of avonex inventory consisted of million for remaining supplies of the alternative presentations of avonex that were no longer needed after the fda approved a new component for the pre filled syringe formulation of avonex in march  million for product that failed to meet quality specifications and million of expired product 
the zevalin inventory was written down when it was determined that it would not be marketable based on estimates of demand 
additionally  in the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of million to cost of product revenues related to an impairment of certain capitalized zevalin patents  to reflect the adjustment to net realizable value 
as part of our comprehensive strategic plan  we are seeking to divest amevive 
we have evaluated our amevive inventory based on third party contract negotiations and determined its expected net realizable value 
as a result  we recorded charges of million to cost of product revenues in to write down amevive to its net realizable value at december  in addition  our amevive inventory balance at december  was million  of which million related to the historical manufacturing costs and million related to the increase in fair market value of inventory acquired at the merger

these increases in research and development expenses were offset by a decrease of million of expenses related to our ongoing clinical trials  primarily related to lower than expected clinical trial expenses for tysabri and amevive 
the increase in research and development expenses in over primarily related to a full year of the former biogen  inc expenses in compared to the period from november  through december  the increase related to the former biogen  inc was million and consisted primarily of million of expenses related to pre clinical research activities  million of development research activities  including clinical trials  related to tysabri and amevive  million of biopharmaceutical operations expenses mainly attributable to manufacturing and supply chain functions  million of increased depreciation and infrastructure costs related to the expansion of our manufacturing and research facilities  and million for our joint development collaboration agreements 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in for a number of reasons  including our plans to commit significant additional capital to external business development and research opportunities

in conjunction with the plan  we consolidated or eliminated certain internal management layers and staff functions  resulting in the reduction of our workforce by approximately  or approximately positions worldwide 
these adjustments took place across company functions  departments and sites  and were substantially implemented by the end of we have recorded restructuring charges associated with these activities  which consist primarily of severance and other employee termination costs  including health benefits  outplacement and bonuses 
other costs include write downs of certain research assets that will no longer be utilized  consulting costs in connection with the restructuring effort and costs related to the acceleration of restricted stock  offset by the reversal of previously recognized compensation due to unvested restricted stock cancellations 
for the year ended december   million of restructuring charges are included in research and development expenses  and million are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these remaining unpaid costs at december  are included in accrued expenses and other on our consolidated balance sheet 
the components of the charges are as follows table in thousands costs incurred paid settled through remaining liability at during december  december  severance and employee termination costs incurred other costs we may have additional charges in future periods related to the plan

facility impairments and loss on sale in the third and fourth quarters of  in connection with our comprehensive strategic plan  we recorded an impairment charge of million to facility impairments and loss on sale  which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of our nico clinical manufacturing facility in oceanside  california  and classified the asset as held for sale under sfas on june   genentech purchased our large scale biologics manufacturing facility in oceanside  california  known as nimo  along with approximately acres of real property located in oceanside  california upon which nimo is located  together with improvements  related property rights  and certain personal property intangibles and contracts at or related to the real property 
through the first quarter of  we intended to hold and continue using the facility 
in june  we determined instead to accept an offer from genentech to purchase the facility 
total consideration for the purchase was million 
the loss from this transaction was million  which consisted primarily of the write down of nimo to its net selling price  sales and transfer taxes  and other associated transaction costs 
as of march   after our voluntary suspension of tysabri  we reconsidered our construction plans and determined that we would proceed with the bulk manufacturing component of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in hillerod 
additionally  we added a labeling and packaging component to the project 
we also determined that we would no longer proceed with the fill finish component of our large scale biological manufacturing facility in hillerod 
as a result  in the first quarter of  we wrote off million to facility impairments and loss on sale expense of engineering costs related to the fill finish component that had previously been capitalized 
other income expense  net december  in thousands interest income interest expense other expense total other income expense  net interest income totaled million in compared to million in and million in the increase in interest income in as compared to is primarily due to higher yields on our marketable securities portfolio

the foundation is to operate exclusively for the benefit of funding charitable  educational and scientific purposes 
certain directors  executive officers and other employees serve as directors and officers of the foundation 
we classify charitable contributions to other expense 
in december  we recorded charges of million and million related to the final settlement of patent infringement disputes with apoxis sa and corixa corporation  respectively 
these payments were charged to other expense in the fourth quarter of acquired in process research and development in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a charge of million related to the write off of acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  related to the merger 
the amount expensed as ipr d represents the estimated fair value of purchased in process technology for projects that  as of the acquisition date  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the estimated fair value of these projects was determined based on the use of a discounted cash flow model 
for each project  the estimated after tax cash flows were probability weighted to take into account the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization 
these cash flows were then discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
as of december   we estimated future research and development expenses of approximately million and million would be incurred to complete the purchased neurology and rheumatology research projects  respectively 
since november   the date of the merger  we have discontinued certain clinical trials 
estimates of expenses are net of any research and development expenses that were shared under collaborations with corporate partners 
the projects  which were in various stages of development  from preclinical through phase iii clinical trials  are  unless they have been discontinued  expected to reach completion at various dates ranging from through additionally  in connection with the voluntary suspension of marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri in february  we suspended dosing in clinical trials of tysabri in ms  crohn s disease and ra 
the major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of these projects are that we will not be able to confirm the safety and efficacy of the technology with data from clinical trials and that we will not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the cash flows or the timely and successful completion of such projects will materialize  as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary significantly from estimated results 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets we recorded amortization expense of million in compared to million in and million in related to the intangible assets of billion acquired in the merger 
the decrease in largely relates to a change in estimate in the calculation of economic consumption for core technology  offset by a million charge to write down certain core technology intangible assets to net realizable value in intangible assets consist of billion in core technology  million in patents and million in trademarks 
amortization of the core technology is provided over the estimated useful lives of the technology ranging from to years  based on the greater of straight line or economic consumption 
amortization of the out licensed patents for which we receive royalties is provided over the remaining lives of the patents of years 
trademarks have an indefinite life and  as such  are not amortized 
in the third quarter of  we completed a review of our business opportunities in each of the relevant commercial markets in which our products are sold and determined their expected profitability 
as a result of this review  in the third quarter of  management determined that certain clinical trials would not continue which indicated that the carrying value of certain technology intangible assets related to future sales of avonex in japan may not be recoverable 
as a result  we recorded a charge of approximately million to amortization of acquired intangible assets  which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of technology intangible assets related to avonex 
as part of our decision to divest our amevive product  we have reassessed our remaining intangible assets related to amevive  and have determined that there are no impairments related to these assets as a result of our decision to divest amevive 
however  should new information arise  we may be required to take impairment charges related to certain of our intangibles 
in the third quarter of  management determined that certain clinical trials would not continue which indicated that the carrying value of certain core technology intangible assets related to amevive may not be recoverable 
as a result  in the third quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to amortization of acquired intangible assets  which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of core technology intangible assets related to amevive 
we review our intangible assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if future events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  we may be required to record additional charges to our results of operations 
income tax provision our effective tax rate in was approximately compared to in and in our effective tax rate for varied from the us federal statutory rate and prior years primarily due to the acquisition related intangible amortization arising from purchase accounting related to foreign jurisdictions and a one time tax charge related to the repatriation of a portion of the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiary offset  in part  by the effect of lower income tax rates less than us statutory corporate rate in certain us jurisdictions in which we operate  tax credits allowed for research and experimentation expenses in the us  and the new domestic manufacturing deduction 
excluding the effect of purchase accounting adjustments  our non gaap effective tax rate would have been approximately

our effective tax rate for varied substantially from the us federal statutory rate and prior years primarily due to the pre tax loss resulting from the write off of non deductible ipr d and other costs in connection with the merger with biogen  inc which were not deductible for income tax purposes 
excluding the effect of our write off of ipr d  our non gaap effective tax rate would have been approximately 
we have tax credit carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes available to offset future taxable income 
the utilization of our tax credits may be subject to an annual limitation under the internal revenue code due to a 
table of contents cumulative change of ownership of more than in prior years 
however  we anticipate that this annual limitation will result only in a slight deferral in the utilization of our net tax credits 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and income tax liabilities and projections for future taxable income over the periods that our deferred tax assets are either tax deductible or to which our tax credits may be carried  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the entire benefits of our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates of future taxable income or we adjust our estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
on october   the american jobs creation act of  or the act  was signed into law 
the act created a temporary incentive  which expired on december   for us multinationals to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us at an effective tax rate that could be as low as 
on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of  or fsp fsp allowed companies additional time to evaluate the effect of the law on whether unrepatriated foreign earnings continue to qualify for sfas s exception to recognizing deferred tax liabilities 
we completed our evaluation during the fourth quarter of and decided to take advantage of this temporary tax incentive 
a total distribution of million was made by one of our foreign subsidiaries to one of our us subsidiaries in december we incurred a charge to our consolidated results of operations of approximately million in the fourth quarter of for the tax cost related to the distribution 
the act also provides a deduction for domestic manufacturing  which reduced our effective tax rate by approximately for the current year 
we estimate that the deduction will reduce our effective tax rate by a higher amount in future years  as the deduction is fully phased in 
during the fourth quarter of  the internal revenue service irs completed its exam of legacy biogen  inc s  now biogen idec ma  inc 
s  consolidated federal income tax returns for the fiscal years and and issued an assessment 
we subsequently paid the majority of the amounts assessed and are appealing one issue 
as a result of this and other income tax audit activity  biogen idec ma  inc reassessed its liability for income tax contingencies to reflect the irs findings and recorded a million reduction in these liabilities during the fourth quarter of the corresponding effects of the adjustments to the liability for income tax contingencies through resulted in a reduction in goodwill of million for amounts related to periods prior to the acquisition by idec pharmaceuticals corporation and an increase in income tax expense associated with continuing operations of million 
financial condition we have financed our operating and capital expenditures principally through profits and other revenues from our joint business arrangement with genentech related to the sale of rituxan  sales of avonex  amevive  and zevalin  royalty revenues  corporate partner revenues  debt financing transactions and interest income 
we expect to finance our current and planned operating requirements principally through cash on hand  which includes funds from our joint business arrangement with genentech related to the sale of rituxan  commercial sales of avonex and zevalin  royalties and existing collaborative agreements and contracts  and sales of tysabri if we are able to re launch this product 
we believe that these funds will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may  from time to time  seek additional funding through a combination of new collaborative agreements  strategic alliances and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
our working capital and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the continued commercial success of avonex and rituxan and  to a lesser extent  zevalin  the future commercial availability of tysabri if we are able to re launch this product  the timing and expense of obtaining regulatory approvals for products in development  the cost of launching new products  and the success of those products  funding and timing of payments related to several significant capital projects  the progress of our preclinical and clinical testing  fluctuating or increasing manufacturing requirements and research and development programs  levels of resources that we need to devote to the development of manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  including resources devoted to the marketing of avonex  rituxan  zevalin and future products  as well as the future marketing and manufacturing of tysabri if we are able to re launch this product  technological advances  status of products being developed by competitors  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements with other organizations  and working capital required to satisfy the options of holders of our

the plaintiff seeks rescission of the sale  return of the purchase price  expenses incidental to the sale  attorneys fees and interest  but excludes from the relief sought any damages related to any personal injuries suffered because of the consumption of tysabri 
we have not been served with the complaint and are presently evaluating the plaintiff s contentions 
we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against all of the allegations and claims in this lawsuit 
at this stage of the litigation  we cannot make any estimate of potential loss or range of loss 
in addition  we are involved in certain other legal proceedings generally incidental to our normal business activities 
while the outcome of any of these proceedings cannot be accurately predicted  we do not believe the ultimate resolution of any of these existing matters would have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and related allowances  marketable securities  derivative and hedging activities  inventories  patents  income taxes including the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  impairment for intangible assets and goodwill  valuation of long lived assets and investments  research and development  loans  pensions  retiree medical plan  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  superceded in part by sab  provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
sab establishes the sec s view that it is not appropriate to recognize revenue until all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sab also requires that both title and the risks and rewards of ownership be transferred to the buyer before revenue can be recognized 
we believe that our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with sab product revenue consists of sales from four of our products avonex  amevive  zevalin  and tysabri 
the timing of distributor orders and shipments can cause variability in earnings 
revenues from product sales are recognized when product is shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  typically upon delivery 
revenues are recorded net of applicable allowances for returns  patient assistance  trade term discounts  medicaid rebates  veteran s administration rebates  managed care discounts and other applicable allowances 
included in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and  are allowances for returns  rebates  discounts and other allowances which totaled million and million  respectively 
at december   our allowance for product returns  which is a component of allowances for returns  rebates  discounts and other allowances  was million 
at december   total discounts and allowances were approximately of total current assets and less than of total assets 
we prepare our estimates for sales returns and allowances  discounts and rebates quarterly based primarily on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
if actual future results vary  we may need to adjust our estimates  which could have an impact on earnings in the period of adjustment 
in the past  our estimates based on historical experience have not materially differed from actual results 
we closely monitor levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
at december   we had approximately  on average  to weeks of inventory in the distribution channel 
the shelf life associated with our products 
table of contents is long  to months  depending on the product 
obsolescence due to dating expiration has not been a historical concern  given the rapidity in which our products move through the channel 
changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us 
we do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in our consolidated statements of income related to sales returns and allowances  discounts  and rebates 
our sales returns and allowances  discounts  and rebates in were higher than due to sales returns related to the suspension to tysabri  product price increases and new distributor and managed care agreements 
our sales returns and allowances  discounts  and rebates in were substantially higher than  since sales returns and allowances  discounts  and rebates related to avonex and amevive were included in our results of operations for all of as opposed to  when sales returns and allowances  discounts  and rebates related to avonex and amevive were included in our results of operations only for the period from november  through december  in  the amount of product returns was approximately of product revenue for all our products  compared to approximately in and in product returns  which is a component of allowances for returns  rebates  discounts and other allowances  were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase of product returns in consisted primarily of million  due to the voluntary suspension of tysabri 
product returns in included million related to product sales made prior to  which represents less than of total product revenues  of which million was reserved for at december  during  we had encountered problems in manufacturing our pre filled syringe formulation of avonex  and as a result  we had an increase in our expected level of returns related to batches that failed to meet specifications 
in november  we received regulatory approval in the us of tysabri for the treatment of ms and paid a million approval based milestone to elan 
upon approval  we also became obligated to provide elan with million against reimbursement of commercialization costs 
elan can apply million of the credits per year 
the approval and credit milestones were capitalized upon approval in investments and other assets and are being amortized over the remaining patent life of years 
the amortization of the approval and credit milestones is being recorded as a reduction of revenue 
in february  in consultation with the fda  we and elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri  and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of tysabri until further notification 
under our agreement with elan  we manufacture tysabri and  in the us prior to the suspension  sold tysabri to elan who then distributed tysabri to third party distributors 
prior to the suspension  we recorded revenue when tysabri was shipped from elan to third party distributors 
in  we recorded million of net product revenues related to sales of tysabri to elan that we estimate were ultimately dosed into patients 
additionally  as of march   we deferred million in revenue under our revenue recognition policy with elan  which has been fully paid by elan  related to sales of tysabri which had not yet been shipped by elan and remains deferred at december  through december   we incurred net withdrawal costs of million related to sales returns in connection with the voluntary suspension of tysabri 
should our estimate of expected sales returns and allowances be materially different from actual returns  then we may be required to record adjustments  which could result in additional revenues or further reductions of revenue 
we have various contracts with distributors that provide for discounts and rebates 
these contracts are classified as a reduction of revenue 
we also maintain select customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel 
we have established the fair value of these contracts and classified these customer service contracts as sales and marketing expense 
if we had concluded that sufficient evidence of the fair value did not exist for these contracts  we would have been required to classify these costs as a reduction of revenue 
revenues from unconsolidated joint business consist of our share of the rituxan pretax copromotion profits generated from our copromotion arrangement with genentech  reimbursement from genentech of our rituxan related sales force and development expenses and royalties from genentech for sales of rituxan outside the us by roche and zenyaku 
under the copromotion arrangement  all us sales of rituxan and associated costs and expenses are recognized by genentech and we record our share of the pretax copromotion profits on a quarterly basis  as defined in our amended and restated collaboration agreement with genentech 
pretax copromotion profits 
table of contents under the copromotion arrangement are derived by taking us net sales of rituxan to third party customers less cost of sales  third party royalty expenses  distribution  selling and marketing expenses and joint development expenses incurred by genentech and us 
our profit sharing formula with genentech has two tiers  we earn a higher percentage of the pretax copromotion profits at the upper tier once a fixed pretax copromotion profit level is met 
the profit sharing formula resets annually at the beginning of each year to the lower tier 
in june  we amended and restated our collaboration agreement with genentech to include the development and commercialization of one or more anti cd antibodies targeting b cell disorders  in addition to rituxan  for a broad range of indications 
upon approval of the first new anti cd product  the pretax copromotion profit sharing formula for rituxan and other anti cd products will change over a period of time to a fixed annual profit sharing percentage at the lower tier 
currently  we record our share of expenses incurred for the development of new anti cd products in research and development expense until such time as a new product is approved  at which time we will record our share of pretax copromotion profits related to the new product in revenues from unconsolidated joint business 
we record our royalty revenues on sales of rituxan outside the us on a cash basis 
under the amended and restated collaboration agreement  we will receive lower royalty revenue from genentech on sales by roche and zenyaku of new anti cd products and only for the first years from the date of first commercial sale of such new anti cd products 
we receive royalty revenues under license agreements with a number of third parties that sell products based on technology developed by us or to which we have rights 
the license agreements provide for the payment of royalties to us based on sales of the licensed product 
we record these revenues based on estimates of the sales that occurred during the relevant period 
the relevant period estimates of sales are based on interim data provided by licensees and analysis of historical royalties paid to us  adjusted for any changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
we maintain regular communication with our licensees in order to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues are reconciled and adjusted for in the period which they become known  typically the following quarter 
historically  adjustments have not been material based on actual amounts paid by licensees 
there are no future performance obligations on our part under these license agreements 
under this policy  revenue can vary due to factors such as resolution of royalty disputes and arbitration 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  which could affect future earnings 
marketable securities and investments we invest our excess cash balances in short term and long term marketable securities  principally corporate notes and government securities 
at december   substantially all of our securities were classified as available for sale 
all available for sale securities are recorded at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income in shareholders equity  net of related tax effects 
realized gains and losses and declines in value  if any  judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are reported in other expense 
in  we recognized a charge of approximately million for certain unrealized losses on available for sale securities that were determined to be other than temporary  because we expected that the securities would be sold prior to a potential recovery of their decline in value 
any future determinations that unrealized losses are other than temporary could have an impact on earnings 
the cost of available for sale securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
we have established guidelines that maintain safety and provide adequate liquidity in our available for sale portfolio 
these guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates 
as part of our strategic product development efforts  we invest in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies with which we have collaborative agreements

 or sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  addresses the accounting for investment in marketable equity securities 
as a matter of policy  we determine on a quarterly basis whether any decline in the fair value of a marketable security is temporary or other than temporary 
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income in shareholders equity  
table of contents net of related tax effects 
if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is determined to be other than temporary  such marketable security is written down to its estimated fair value with a charge to current earnings 
the factors that we consider in our assessments include the fair market value of the security  the duration of the security s decline  and prospects for the company  including favorable clinical trial results  new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements 
in  we recognized a million charge for the impairment of an investment that was determined to be other than temporary following a decline in value during the first quarter of due to unfavorable clinical results and the future prospects for the company 
any future determinations that unrealized losses are other than temporary could have an impact on earnings 
at december   we had million of unrealized losses related to these marketable securities 
the fair market value of these marketable securities totaled million at december  we also invest in equity securities of certain companies whose securities are not publicly traded and fair value is not readily available 
these investments are recorded using the cost method of accounting and  as a matter of policy  we monitor these investments in private securities on a quarterly basis  and determine whether any impairment in their value would require a charge to current earnings  based on the implied value from any recent rounds of financing completed by the investee  market prices of comparable public companies  and general market conditions 
at december   we included approximately million of investments in private securities in investments and other assets 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of an investment that completed an initial public offering during the period  when we determined that the offering price and our unrealized loss related to the entity as of september  was not likely to be recovered to our carrying value prior to the company being publicly traded 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of an investment that was determined to be other than temporary due to the future prospects for the company 
there were no significant charges to current earnings in or for impairments of these investments 
additional recognition of impairments for these securities may cause variability in earnings 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
included in inventory are raw materials used in the production of pre clinical and clinical products  which are expensed as research and development costs when consumed 
our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval  when  based on management s judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
our accounting policy addresses the attributes that should be considered in evaluating whether the costs to manufacture a product have met the definition of an asset as stipulated in fasb concepts statement no 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints and impediments to approval  including safety  efficacy and potential labeling restrictions 
we evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication in which it will be used 
we consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper approval or commercialization 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization 
we are sensitive to the significant commitment of capital to scale up production and to launch commercialization strategies 
we also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization  trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria 
finally  we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize 
there is a risk inherent in these judgments  which is the reason we disclose the risk and the potential for a change in judgment 
at december  and  all products included in inventory have been approved for sale by either the emea or fda 
in february  in consultation with the fda  we and elan voluntarily suspended the marketing and commercial distribution of tysabri  and we informed physicians that they should suspend dosing of tysabri until further notification 
in addition  we suspended dosing in clinical studies of tysabri in ms  crohn s disease 
table of contents and ra 
these decisions were based on reports of cases pml  a rare and frequently fatal  demyelinating disease of the central nervous system in patients treated with tysabri in clinical studies 
we and elan conducted a safety evaluation of patients treated with tysabri in ms  crohn s disease and ra clinical studies 
the safety evaluation included the review of any reports of potential pml in ms patients receiving tysabri in the commercial setting 
in october  we completed the safety evaluation and found no new confirmed cases of pml 
three confirmed cases of pml were previously reported  two of which were fatal 
in september  we submitted an sbla for tysabri to the fda for the treatment of ms 
in november  we were granted priority review status for the sbla  which will result in action by the fda approximately six months from the submission date  or by march in january  we and elan announced that we had received notification from the fda that the peripheral and central nervous system drugs advisory committee would review tysabri for the treatment of ms on march  we and elan have also submitted a similar data package to the emea 
this information was supplied as part of the ongoing emea review process  which was initiated in the summer of with the filing for approval of tysabri as a treatment for ms 
in february  we and elan announced that the fda informed the companies that they removed the hold on clinical trial dosing of tysabri 
we and elan expect to begin an open label  multi center safety extension study of tysabri monotherapy in the us and internationally in the coming weeks 
we plan to work with regulatory authorities to determine if dosing in ms and other clinical studies will be re initiated and the future commercial availability of the product 
we cannot predict the outcome of our work with regulatory authorities 
tysabri could be permanently withdrawn from the market or re introduced to the market with significant restrictions on its permissible uses  black box or other significant safety warnings in its label and such other restrictions  requirements and limitations as the fda  emea or other regulatory authorities may require 
while we presently believe that we will be able to find a path forward for tysabri  there are no assurances as to the likelihood of success 
in light of our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that our tysabri inventory would be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life  we wrote down all of the million of tysabri inventory that had been included on the balance sheet as of december   which was charged to cost of product revenues 
we manufactured tysabri during the first and second quarter of and completed our scheduled production of tysabri during july because of the uncertain future commercial availability of tysabri and our inability to predict to the required degree of certainty that tysabri inventory will be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life  we expensed million of costs related to the manufacture of tysabri in the first quarter of to cost of product revenues 
at the time of production  the inventory was believed to be commercially saleable 
beginning in the second quarter of  as we were working with clinical investigators to understand the possible risks of pml  we charged the costs related to the manufacture of tysabri to research and development expense 
as a result  we expensed million related to the manufacture of tysabri to research and development expense during in the first quarter of  in light of expectations of re introduction of tysabri  we began a new manufacturing campaign 
see item a 
risk factors safety issues with tysabri could significantly affect our growth 
we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs may be required 
this periodic review led to the write downs of tysabri inventory as of december  and the expensing of tysabri during  as described above  and may lead us to expense tysabri in subsequent periods 
our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring throughout the manufacturing process 
periodically  certain batches or units of product may no longer meet quality specifications or may expire 
as a result  included in product cost of revenues were write downs of commercial inventory that did not meet quality specifications or became obsolete due to dating expiration  in all cases this product inventory was written down to its net realizable value 
in  we wrote down million  million and million of unmarketable inventory related to amevive  avonex and zevalin  respectively  which was charged to cost of product revenues 
the write downs for amevive inventory consisted of million for expired product and million for product that failed to meet quality specifications 
the write downs of avonex inventory consisted of million for remaining supplies of the alternative presentations of avonex that were no longer needed after 
table of contents the fda approved a new component for the pre filled syringe formulation of avonex in march  million for product that failed to meet quality specifications and million of expired product 
the write down of zevalin inventory was related to inventory that would not be marketable based on estimates of demand 
as part of our comprehensive strategic plan  we are seeking to divest amevive 
we have evaluated our amevive inventory based on third party contract negotiations and determined its expected net realizable value 
as a result  we recorded charges of million to cost of product revenues in to write down amevive to its net realizable value at december  in addition  our amevive inventory balance at december  was million  of which million related to the historical manufacturing costs and million related to the increase in fair market value of inventory acquired at the merger 
we wrote down million of unmarketable inventory during  which was charged to cost of product revenues and consisted of million related to avonex  million related to zevalin  million related to amevive and million related to tysabri 
the avonex and amevive inventory was written down when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications 
the zevalin inventory was written down when it was determined that the inventory did not meet quality specifications or when it was determined that the inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand 
in  cost of product revenues consisted of million related to avonex  million related to zevalin and million related to amevive  of which million represents the difference between the cost of inventory recorded at the acquisition date and its historical manufacturing cost for avonex and amevive 
in  we wrote down million related to avonex  million related to amevive and million related to zevalin 
of the million write down related to avonex  million represented the increase to fair market value of inventory acquired at the merger and million represented the historical manufacturing costs 
income taxes income tax expense includes a provision for income tax contingencies 
we utilize a best estimate approach for establishing loss contingencies related to income tax uncertainties based on the definition of a liability in fasb concept statement no 
these provisions are adjusted when an event occurs or additional information becomes available that impacts the amounts of our estimates 
during the fourth quarter of  the irs completed its exam of legacy biogen  inc s  now biogen idec ma  inc 
s consolidated federal income tax returns for the fiscal years and and issued an assessment 
we subsequently paid the majority of the amounts assessed and are appealing one issue 
as a result of this and other income tax audit activity  biogen idec ma  inc reassessed its liability for income tax contingencies to reflect the irs findings and recorded a million reduction in these liabilities during the fourth quarter of the corresponding effects of the adjustments to the liability for income tax contingencies through resulted in a reduction in goodwill of million for amounts related to periods prior to the acquisition by idec pharmaceutical corporation and an increase in income tax expense associated with continuing operations of million 
while we believe that the amount of the tax estimates is reasonable  it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may differ from provisions for contingencies  and these differences could be significant 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
significant management judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in performing this assessment  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making this determination  under the applicable financial accounting standards  we are allowed to consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and the effects of viable tax planning strategies 
our estimates of future taxable income include  among other items  our estimates of future income tax deductions related to the 
table of contents exercise of stock options 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  we adjust our estimates in future periods we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
assets held for sale as part of the comprehensive strategic plan that we announced in september  we are seeking to divest several other non core assets  including amevive  our nico clinical manufacturing facility in oceanside  california and certain real property in oceanside  california 
we consider those assets and certain other miscellaneous assets as held for sale  since they meet the criteria of held for sale under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and have reported those assets separately in current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at december  as discussed above  the nico clinical manufacturing facility was adjusted to its net realizable value 
our amevive assets held for sale include million related to intangible assets  net  and million for property  plant and equipment  net 
in february  we sold the nico clinical manufacturing facility to genentech 
severance and other costs from restructuring plan in september  we began implementing a comprehensive strategic plan designed to position us for long term growth 
in conjunction with the plan  we consolidated or eliminated certain internal management layers and staff functions  resulting in the reduction of our workforce by approximately  or approximately positions worldwide 
these adjustments took place across company functions  departments and sites  and were substantially implemented as of december  we have recorded restructuring charges associated with these activities  which consist primarily of severance and other employee termination costs  including health benefits  outplacement and bonuses 
other costs include write downs of certain research assets that will no longer be utilized  consulting costs in connection with the restructuring effort and costs related to the acceleration of restricted stock  offset by the reversal of previously recognized compensation due to unvested restricted stock cancellations 
in  restructuring charges of million are included in research and development and million are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the timing and amounts of these charges are based on the estimated termination dates of the employees and the related termination charges 
if actual timing is different than planned  our total restructuring charge amount could change 
any remaining unpaid costs at december  are included in accrued expenses and other on our consolidated balance sheet 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of upfront fees and milestones paid to collaborators and expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities expenses  overhead expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses  contract services and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
the timing of upfront fees and milestone payments in the future may cause variability in future research and development expense 
clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with contract research organizations  or cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and site monitoring costs  and data management costs 
we maintain regular communication with our cro vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses have not been material and are adjusted for in the period which they become known 
we have entered into certain research agreements in which we share expenses with our collaborator 
we have entered into other collaborations where we are reimbursed for work performed on behalf of our collaborative partners 
we record these expenses as research and development expenses 
if the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we receive payments from the collaborator  we record payments by the collaborator for their share of the development effort as a reduction of research and development expense 
if the arrangement is a reimbursement of research and development expenses  we record the reimbursement as corporate partner revenue 

table of contents we manufactured tysabri during the first and second quarter of and completed our scheduled production of tysabri during july because of the uncertain future commercial availability of tysabri and our inability to predict with the required degree of certainty that tysabri inventory will be realized in commercial sales prior to the expiration of its shelf life  we expensed million of costs related to the manufacture of tysabri in the first quarter of to cost of product revenues 
at the time of production  the inventory was believed to be commercially saleable 
beginning in the second quarter of  we charged the costs related to the manufacture of tysabri to research and development expense 
as a result  we expensed million related to the manufacture of tysabri to research and development expense during in the first quarter of  in light of expectations of re introduction of tysabri  we began a new manufacturing campaign 
derivatives and hedging activities we have operations in europe  japan  australia and canada in connection with the sale of avonex 
we also receive royalty revenues based on worldwide product sales by our licensees 
as a result  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows can be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily euro  swedish krona  british pound  japanese yen  swiss franc and canadian dollar 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk and do not engage in currency speculation 
we use these forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or sfas  requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and  if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
we assess  both at their inception and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows of hedged items 
we assess hedge ineffectiveness on a quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent significant 
if we determine that a forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring  we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument  and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings 
under this policy  and in accordance with sfas  earnings may vary if the forecasted transaction does not occur  or if there is material hedge ineffectiveness or if the hedge ceases to be highly effective 
impairments of long lived assets long lived assets to be held and used  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
in the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
long lived assets to be disposed of are carried at fair value less costs to sell 
in the third and fourth quarters of  in connection with our comprehensive strategic plan  we recorded impairment charges of million to facility impairments and loss on sale  which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of our nico clinical manufacturing facility in oceanside  california  and classified the asset as held for sale under sfas in the third quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million to selling  general and administrative expense equal to the remaining balance of the prepaid expense associated with our arrangement with mds canada related to zevalin  since the carrying amount of prepaid expense was not recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of zevalin 
in march  we determined that we would no longer proceed with the fill finish component of our large scale biologic manufacturing facility in hillerod 
as a result  in the first quarter of  we recorded an impairment 
table of contents charge to facility impairments and loss on sale of approximately million of engineering costs that had previously been capitalized 
we have assessed our long lived assets related to tysabri  which include intangible assets and facilities  and have determined that there are no impairments related to these assets as a result of the suspension of the marketing of tysabri 
however  should new information arise  we may be required to take impairment charges related to certain of our long lived assets 
see item a 
risk factors safety issues with tysabri could significantly affect our growth 
intangible assets and goodwill in connection with the merger  we recorded intangible assets related to patents  trademarks  and core technology as part of the purchase price 
these intangible assets were recorded at fair value  and at december  and december  are net of accumulated amortization and impairments 
intangible assets related to out licensed patents and core technology are amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years  based on the greater of straight line method or economic consumption each period 
these amortization costs are included in amortization of acquired intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
intangible assets related to trademarks have indefinite lives  and as a result are not amortized  but are subject to review for impairment 
we review our intangible assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in the third quarter of  we completed a review of our business opportunities in each of the relevant commercial markets in which our products are sold and determined their expected profitability 
as a result of this review  in the third quarter of  management determined that certain clinical trials would not continue which indicated that the carrying value of certain core technology intangible assets related to future sales of avonex in japan may not be recoverable 
as a result  we recorded a charge of approximately million to amortization of acquired intangible assets  which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of core technology intangible assets related to avonex 
additionally  in the third quarter of  we recorded a charge of million to cost of product revenues related to an impairment of certain capitalized zevalin patents  to reflect the adjustment to net realizable value 
as part of our decision to divest our amevive product  we have reassessed our remaining intangible assets related to amevive  and have determined that there are no impairments related to these assets as a result of our decision to divest amevive 
however  should new information arise  we may be required to take impairment charges related to certain of our intangibles 
in the fourth quarter of  we reclassed our intangible assets associated with amevive totaling million on a net basis to assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet 
in the third quarter of  management determined that certain clinical trials would not continue which indicated that the carrying value of certain core technology intangible assets related to amevive may not be recoverable 
as a result  we recorded a charge of approximately million to amortization of acquired intangible assets  which reflects the adjustment to net realizable value of core technology intangible assets related to amevive 
goodwill associated with the merger represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather subject to periodic review for impairment 
goodwill is reviewed annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill might not be recoverable 
as a result of the voluntary suspension of tysabri in february  we performed an interim review for impairment of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets  and we determined that goodwill was not impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual assessment of our goodwill  and concluded that goodwill was not impaired at october  however  should new information arise regarding the voluntary suspension of tysabri  we may need to reassess goodwill for impairment in light of the new information and we may be required to take impairment charges related to goodwill

new accounting standards in november  the fasb released fasb staff position fsp no 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
this fsp  effective january   provides accounting guidance regarding the determination of when an impairment of debt and equity securities should be considered other than temporary  as well as the subsequent accounting for these investments 
the adoption of this fsp is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and supersedes fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of an accounting change on one or more individual prior periods presented  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement 
when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
sfas shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the provisions of the sfas will have a significant impact on our results of operations

sfas r will require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
sfas r offers alternative methods for determining the fair value 
in april  the sec issued a new rule that allows companies to implement sfas r at the beginning of the next fiscal year  instead of the next reporting period  that begins after june  as a result  we will implement sfas r in the reporting period starting january  we expect that sfas r will have a significant impact on our financial statements

sfas clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of sfas shall be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the provisions of sfas will have a significant impact on our results of operations 

table of contents disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting controls and procedures we have carried out an evaluation  under the supervision and the participation of our management  including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules a e and d e under the securities exchange act of  as amended  or the securities exchange act  as of december  based upon that evaluation  our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that  as of the end of that period  our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing reasonable assurance that a the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the securities exchange act is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms  and b such information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer  as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures  our management recognized that any controls and procedures  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives  and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures
