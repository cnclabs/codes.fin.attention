item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
our fiscal year ends december this document contains certain forward looking statements including  among others  anticipated trends in our financial condition and results of operations and our business strategy 
see part i  item a  risk factors 
these forward looking statements are based largely on our current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
important factors to consider in evaluating such forward looking statements include i changes in external factors or in our internal budgeting process which might impact trends in our results of operations  ii unanticipated working capital or other cash requirements  iii changes in our business strategy or an inability to execute our strategy due to unanticipated changes in the industries in which we operate  and iv various competitive market factors that may prevent us from competing successfully in the marketplace 
overview we design and manufacture miniature displays  which we refer to as oled on silicon microdisplays  and microdisplay modules for virtual imaging  primarily for incorporation into the products of other manufacturers 
microdisplays are typically smaller than many postage stamps  but when viewed through a magnifier they can contain all of the information appearing on a high resolution personal computer screen 
our microdisplays use organic light emitting diodes  or oleds  which emit light themselves when a current is passed through the device 
our technology permits oleds to be coated onto silicon chips to produce high resolution oled on silicon microdisplays 
we believe that our oled on silicon microdisplays offer a number of advantages in near to the eye applications over other current microdisplay technologies  including lower power requirements  less weight  fast video speed without flicker  and wider viewing angles 
in addition  many computer and video electronic system functions can be built directly into the oled on silicon microdisplay  resulting in compact systems with lower expected overall system costs relative to alternate microdisplay technologies 
since our inception in through  we derived the majority of our revenues from fees paid to us under research and development contracts  primarily with the us federal government 
we have devoted significant resources to the development and commercial launch of our products 
we commenced limited initial sales of our svga microdisplay in may and commenced shipping samples of our svga d microdisplay in february from inception to december   we have recognized an aggregate of approximately million from sales of our products  and as of december   we have a backlog of million in products ordered for delivery through these products are being applied or considered for near eye and headset applications in products such as entertainment and gaming headsets  handheld internet and telecommunication appliances  viewfinders  and wearable computers to be manufactured by original equipment manufacturer oem customers 
we have also shipped a limited number of our z dvisor personal display systems 
in addition to marketing oled on silicon microdisplays as components  we also offer microdisplays as an integrated package  which we call microviewer that includes a compact lens for viewing the microdisplay and electronic interfaces to convert the signal from our customer s product into a viewable image on the microdisplay 
through our operations in washington state we are also developing head wearable displays that incorporate our microviewer 
we license our core oled technology from eastman kodak and we have developed our own technology to create high performance oled on silicon microdisplays and related optical systems 
we believe our technology licensing agreement with eastman kodak  coupled with our own intellectual property portfolio  gives us a leadership position in oled and oled on silicon microdisplay technology 
we believe that we are the only company to demonstrate publicly and market full color small molecule oled on silicon microdisplays 
company history historically  we have been a developmental stage company 
as of january   we were no longer classified as a development stage company 
we have transitioned to manufacturing our product and intend to significantly increase our marketing  sales  and research and development efforts  and expand our operating infrastructure 
currently  most of our operating expenses are fixed 
if we are unable to generate significant revenues  our net losses in any given period could be greater than expected 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
not all of the accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the sec definition 
revenue and cost recognition revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  such as when a purchase order or contract is received from the customer  the price is fixed  title and risk of loss to the goods has changed and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
revenue is recognized at shipment and we record a reserve for estimated sales returns  which is reflected as a reduction of revenue at the time of revenue recognition 
products sold directly to consumers have a thirty day right of return 
revenue on consumer products is deferred until the right of return has expired 
revenues from research and development activities relating to firm fixed price contracts are generally recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting as costs are incurred cost to cost basis 
revenues from research and development activities relating to cost plus fee contracts include costs incurred plus a portion of estimated fees or profits based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and an allocation of allowable indirect costs as defined by each contract  as periodically adjusted to reflect revised agreed upon rates 
these rates are subject to audit by the other party 
amounts can be billed on a bi monthly basis 
billing is based on subjective cost investment factors 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
these estimates and assumptions relate to recording net revenue  collectibility of accounts receivable  useful lives and impairment of tangible and intangible assets  accruals  income taxes  inventory realization and other factors 
management has exercised reasonable judgment in deriving these estimates 
consequently  a change in conditions could affect these estimates 
fair value of financial instruments emagin s cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at cost which appropriates fair value due to the short term nature of these instruments 
results of operations the following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  consolidated statements of operations data revenue cost of goods sold gross loss operating expenses research and development stock based compensation selling  general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased by thousand to a total of million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
this increase was due primarily to the broadening of our product offerings with the z product and incremental revenue generated by these sales 
our contract revenue decreased approximately thousand while our product revenue increased approximately thousand 
average price per unit for microdisplays was in and our current expectation is that revenue will continue to grow in if we successfully execute our business plan 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes direct and indirect costs associated with production and inventory losses 
in the year ended december  we recorded approximately million in cost of goods sold which resulted in a gross loss of million as compared to approximately million in costs of goods sold resulting in a gross loss of million in the year ended december  the production expenses for include labor costs related to operating two full eight hour shifts and a partial third shift as compared to a single shift in to accommodate longer operating hours and expected higher product output in we initiated modifications to our production process that resulted in less than of our expected capacity while underway 
stabilization of these modifications initially was expected to be completed early in  but took until the first quarter of to achieve 
as a result gross margins in declined as compared to due to the higher labor costs 
we expect that gross margins will improve in as a result of the higher output resulting from the production line modifications and an increase in volume 
research and development expenses gross research and development expenses increased by million to a total of million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in r d expenses for the year ended december  reflects efforts to develop two new microdisplays and three visor products 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the coming year as we move forward with the completion of the x dvisor  the eyebud personal viewer and the new svga shrink microdisplays 
selling  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million to a total of million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in staff and personnel costs 
we expect marketing  general and administrative expense to increase in future periods as we add to our staff  make additional investments in marketing activities 
other income expense other income  net  for was thousand and was comprised of net interest income of thousand  a gain on miscellaneous equipment sales of thousand  and a gain on foreign exchange of thousand 
other expense  net  for was million and was comprised of million of non cash charges related to the value of the warrants issued to induce the holders of the million in notes to agree to an early conversion of the notes into common stock  million in non cash charges related to the remaining unamortized debt discount and beneficial conversion feature associated with aforementioned notes  and thousand in non cash charges related to the write off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased by million to a total of million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
this increase was due primarily to several of our customers reaching commercial and pre commercial stages with their systems 
our contract revenue decreased approximately thousand while our product revenue increased approximately million 
average unit sales price for displays decreased to in as compared to in as we increase our larger order fulfillment 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes direct and indirect costs associated with production and inventory losses 
in the year ended december  we recorded approximately million in cost of goods sold which resulted in a gross loss of million as compared to approximately million in costs of goods sold resulting in a gross loss of million in the year ended december  although both revenue and costs of goods sold increased approximately million  our gross loss decreased to in from research and development expenses gross research and development expenses increased by thousand to a total of thousand for the year ended december  from thousand for the year ended december  the thousand increase in r d expenses for the year ended december  reflects initial new product development expenses related to new display and visor products  our renewed ability to invest in product improvement and new product lines 
non cash stock based compensation non cash stock based compensation for the year ended december  decreased million to a total of thousand as compared to million for the year ended december  the amount of compensation recorded in was related to the balance of options issued in and re priced during the merger 
non cash stock based compensation costs are the result of amortization of the intrinsic value ascribed for the issuance of stock options at the time of grant 
the amortization was done over the vesting period of such options 
selling  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by million to a total of million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in staff and personnel costs 
other income expense other expenses for were million for up from other income of million in the primary causes of the change were other income of million in related to a gain on debt settlement not repeated in and an increase in interest expense to million in up from million in the increase in interest expense for the nine months ended september  was attributable to three factors million of non cash charges related to the value of the warrants issued to induce the holders of the million in notes to agree to an early conversion of the notes into common stock  million in non cash charges related to the remaining unamortized debt discount and beneficial conversion feature associated with the aforementioned notes  and thousand in non cash charges related to the write off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal source of liquidity was cash of million 
our working capital was million compared to million at december  for the year ended december   net cash used by operating activities was million  primarily attributable to our net loss of million 
for the year ended december   net cash used by operating activities was million  primarily attributable to our net loss of million principally offset by non cash activities of a non cash interest related charge see note 
for the year ended december   net cash used by investing activities was million primarily related to purchases of equipment 
net cash used by investing activities for the year ended december  was million primarily related to equipment purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was million and was comprised primarily of million in proceeds from the sale of common stock and million from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
net cash provided by financing activities the year ended december  was million and was comprised primarily of million in proceeds from the sale of common stock and million from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
our consolidated financial statements as of december  have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the year ending december  our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report dated march  that included an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available 
our ability to continue as a going concern ultimately is dependent on our ability to generate a profit which is likely dependant upon our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing  attain further operating efficiencies and  ultimately  to achieve profitable operations 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
based on our current business plans we expect to take one of two courses of action in order to insure that we have sufficient cash to meet our requirements over the next months 
we currently expect that our business will experience significant revenue growth during which will result in higher accounts receivable levels and higher inventory levels 
to fund these requirements as well as other operating or investing cash requirements  we intend to use debt collateralized by our assets and to a lesser extent the sale of equity 
though we have a proven history of successfully raising capital there is no guarantee that we will be successful with our current efforts 
if we are not successful  we will reduce the size of our organization and will rely on our current cash and raw materials to support a reduced operating plan that should still support modest growth in our business  but may have a material impact in our ability to sustain growth and therefore achieve profitability 
based on these options  we believe that we will have to raise capital in order to have sufficient cash to meet our requirements over the next months 
contractual obligations the following chart describes the outstanding contractual obligations of the company as of december  payments due by period total year years years capital lease obligations a operating lease obligations purchase obligations b other long term liabilities c total a capital lease obligation includes interest not shown on the balance sheet 
b the majority of purchase orders outstanding contain no cancellation fees except for minor re stocking fees 
c this amount represents the obligation for royalty payments 
effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements in item for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchanges rates 
interest rate risk we hold our assets in cash and cash equivalents 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments or equity securities 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our revenue and expenses are denominated in us dollars 
we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date 
our international business is subject to risks typical of international activity  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  change in political climates  differing tax structures  and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  our future results could be impacted by changes in these or other factors
