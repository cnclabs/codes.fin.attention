item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties such as limited operating and sales history  the uncertainty of market acceptance of our product  dependence on obtaining and maintaining reimbursement  effectiveness and safety of our product over the long term  our ability to obtain and maintain the necessary governmental clearances or approvals to market our product  our ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of our technology  our ability to manage our expansion  our limited history of manufacturing our product  our dependence on single source supplies  third party manufacturers and co marketers  intense competition in the medical device industry  the inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims and product recalls and other factors referenced in this form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we develop  manufacture and market the essure permanent birth control system  an innovative and proprietary medical device for women that was approved for marketing in the united states in november by the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
the essure system uses a soft and flexible micro insert that is delivered into a woman s fallopian tubes to provide permanent birth control by causing a benign tissue in growth that blocks the fallopian tubes 
a successfully placed essure micro insert and the subsequent tissue growth prohibits the egg from traveling through the fallopian tubes and therefore prevents fertilization 
the essure procedure the essure procedure is typically performed as an outpatient procedure and is intended to be a less invasive and a less costly alternative to tubal ligation  the leading form of birth control in the united states and worldwide 
laparoscopic tubal ligation and tubal ligation by laparotomy typically involve abdominal incisions and or punctures  general or regional anesthesia  four to ten days of normal recovery time and the risks associated with an incisional procedure 
the essure procedure does not require cutting or penetrating the abdomen  which lowers the likelihood of post operative pain due to the incisions punctures  and it can be performed in an outpatient setting without general or regional anesthesia 
in the pivotal trial of the essure system  the total procedure time averaged minutes  with an average of minutes of hysteroscopic time to place the essure micro insert 
a patient is typically discharged approximately minutes after the essure procedure 
no overnight hospital stay is required 
furthermore  the essure system is effective without drugs or hormones 
there is a three month waiting period after the procedure during which the woman must use another form of birth control while tissue in growth occurs 
at days following the procedure  the patient completes a follow up examination called a hysterosalpingogram  or hsg  which can determine whether the device was placed successfully and whether the fallopian tubes are occluded 
we believe that the essure system is also an attractive alternative to tubal ligation for physicians  hospitals and payers 
the essure system is a less invasive permanent birth control option for physicians to offer to their patients  hospitals are able to utilize their facilities more cost effectively with the essure procedure compared with tubal ligation  and payers are able to experience cost reductions resulting from the elimination of overhead and procedural costs related to anesthesia and post operative hospital stays associated with tubal ligations 
we also believe the essure system is a viable alternative to other temporary methods of birth control being used when there is no intention of having children in the future 
in addition  payers may also benefit from the reduction of unplanned pregnancies associated with non permanent methods of birth control used by patients who have chosen to avoid the drawbacks of traditional permanent birth control methods but who may elect to use the essure system 
published reports estimate that  tubal ligation procedures are performed each year in the united states 
we intend to tap into this market and establish the essure procedure as the gold standard for permanent birth control 
the essure system is currently being marketed in multiple countries 
in november we received approval from the fda to market the essure system in the united states 
in  we were given approval to affix the ce mark to the essure system  indicating that the essure system is certified for sale throughout the european union  subject to compliance with local regulations such as registration with health ministries and or particular requirements regarding labeling or distribution 
in  the essure permanent birth control system was listed with australia s therapeutic goods administration  which allows us to market and sell the essure system in australia 
in december  we made the decision to terminate our direct subsidiary operations in australia and convert to an independent distributor 
this decision was largely a cost reduction measure in lieu of the small size of the australian market and our inability to manage a direct operation to a cash flow positive position 
we have entered into a distribution agreement and the transition was completed in january in canada  we received clearance from health canada to market the essure system in canada in november we now have distributors in australia  canada and france  which covers europe  middle east  africa  mexico  central america and south america 
effectiveness of the essure system in july  we received approval from the fda to extend effectiveness data on the essure product labeling 
the premarket approval  or pma  supplement filed in late january supports an extension of the effectiveness rate of the essure system to after four years and after five years of follow up  from the previously approved at three years 
the five year effectiveness was demonstrated in a small portion of the women undergoing clinical studies 
five year follow up of all patients in clinical trials is ongoing 
in september  we received approval from the fda to terminate the company s post approval study with physicians who were newly trained in performing the essure procedure due to the positive placement data obtained 
the purpose of the post approval study  required by the fda as a condition of the november approval of the essure system  was to determine the rate of successful bilateral placements of the essure micro inserts at first attempt with a large number of newly trained physicians who were not part of the previous clinical studies 
although treatment of the total number of patients required by fda had not been completed  the data obtained to date provided the company with the opportunity to request that the fda permit an early termination of the study 
because of the fda ruling  the pma supplement submitted in march has been re classified as a final report 
the results of the post approval study demonstrated an improvement in placement rates from those obtained in the pivotal study and the company will seek to obtain a new placement rate claim for the product using this new data 
this will require the company to submit a new pma supplement for the bilateral placement rate claims for which it is seeking fda approval in order to update the labeling for the essure system 
penetration we require physicians to be preceptored for between and cases by a certified trainer before being able to perform the procedure independently 
as of december   we have trained or are in the process of training  physicians in the united states on the essure procedure 
this represents an increase of  physicians over the number of physicians at december  and an increase of physicians over the number of physicians at september  the level of sales for the essure system  particularly in this early period of adoption  is highly dependent on the number of physicians trained to perform the procedure 
however  we understand that a strong base of trained physicians does not necessarily correlate to an increase in revenue proportionately 
furthermore  there are no revenues associated with the training activities 
we do not charge a fee for the activity and no commitment arises for the physician from the preceptorship 
physician training is provided upfront and we have no obligation subsequent to the initial training 
training costs have not been significant to date 
reimbursement of essure market acceptance of the essure system depends in part upon the availability of reimbursement within prevailing healthcare payment systems 
we believe that physician advocacy of our product will be required to continue to obtain reimbursement 
as of december   we have received positive reimbursement decisions for the essure procedure from most private insurers and of the medicaid programs in the country 
we intend to continue our effort to educate payers of the cost effectiveness of our product  and to establish further programs to help physicians to navigate reimbursement issues 
in july  the unitedhealthcare group  or uhc  approved the essure procedure for reimbursement 
in addition  in february  we received coverage from cigna corporation  or cigna 
as with all healthcare plans  coverage will vary and is dependent upon the individual s specific benefit plan 
effective january   the united states centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  released the final rule for the physician fee schedule 
for the cpt code applicable to the essure procedure  the cms has provided for a national physician payment of  for procedures performed in the office and for physician payment when the procedure is performed in the hospital 
this compares to a medicare national average payment for tubal ligation  the current standard of care for permanent female sterilization  of 
in addition  the cms released the final rule for the hospital outpatient prospective payment system  or opps  which assigns hospital outpatient reimbursement amounts 
this cpt code was assigned a payment level of 
we believe these values are very favorable for the essure procedure and will help in establishing increased utilization of the device amongst doctors 
we expect that the new code  once the process to establish it at all private payers that have given a favorable coverage decision is complete  will significantly ease the burden on a physician s office in obtaining reimbursement for the essure procedure and accelerate the coverage of the essure procedure by private insurance companies and medicaid 
this process is not automatic following receipt of the new cpt code  however  and we anticipate continuing to focus on reimbursement issues for sometime in the future  both to secure our code and payment schedule into the payers databases  as well as to help the physician negotiate a favorable contract for payment off that schedule 
in mid august  the australian department of health  medical services advisory committee msac division recommended against public funding for the essure procedure  citing insufficient evidence for safety  effectiveness and cost effectiveness 
the overall market for female sterilization in australia is very small and we believe that our market penetration will remain limited by the msac decision until such time as we are able to submit sufficient long term data to obtain public funding 
adoption of the essure system the essure system is a novel product in the contraception market  which is dominated by procedures that are well established among physicians and patients and are routinely taught to new physicians 
as a result  we believe that recommendations and endorsements by physicians will be essential for market acceptance of our product 
physicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products and treatment practices  partly because of perceived liability risks 
our biggest challenge is to speed up the adoption process to make the essure procedure the standard of care for permanent birth control 
the following discussion summarizes our program in the united states to increase adoption of the essure procedure 
first  we are focused on obtaining favorable coverage decisions from payers representing the private paying and state paying medicaid systems 
we are also focused on getting the cpt code and payment schedule implemented at all of the payers that have given a coverage decision 
until such time as the code is completely implemented and all major payers have provided a coverage decision  we have developed a field based tactical reimbursement group aimed at educating the physician and office staff regarding payer procedures following a declined claim  including appeals and petitioning procedures 
typically a newly covered product will go through a period where claims are either inadvertently declined or are paid at the incorrect amount 
in either instance  the physician is reluctant to perform additional procedures until payment has been secured for earlier cases  causing a decline in utilization 
our tactical reimbursement focus is intended to give the physician and his her staff the tools to ensure that claims will ultimately be paid and thereby encourages the physician to continue performing the essure procedure despite reimbursement issues 
this tactical reimbursement group is generally targeting specific accounts with the aim of eventually meeting with all of our accounts so as to provide them with the knowledge of how to file and follow up on claims on a payer by payer basis 
second  we are expanding our sales territories and channels of distribution so as to increase our call frequency on physicians 
since january   we added sales positions and are expecting to add more in also  we have included regional distributors of women s gynecology products to our marketing efforts 
among other responsibilities  our sales representatives are attempting to increase penetration and utilization of the essure procedure  as well as to facilitate the movement of the essure procedure to the in the office environment 
third  we have entered into certain strategic agreements in the past and we may explore such opportunities in the future 
we intend for these agreements to provide us with the ability to increase awareness  gain market presence and credibility  accelerate our ability to train doctors  as well as expand our market opportunity by driving adoption among a group of physicians not previously targeted by our marketing programs 
the success of these joint marketing campaigns will depend upon the effectiveness of our sales force training programs  market demand for essure procedures in conjunction with the products marketed by strategic partners and the efforts and commitment of strategic partners to the program 
we cannot be certain how successful these programs will be  if at all 
fourth  we are attempting to increase patient awareness  so as to increase the number of women that will ask for information about the essure procedure 
in late july we announced that we initiated an extensive direct to consumer advertising campaign in the chicago  illinois metropolitan area which commenced in august and ran for months 
the campaign involved radio  direct mail and print media magazine advertisements aimed at increasing consumer awareness 
we completed this campaign in august lastly  as appropriate we intend to make labeling improvements to our product as well as physical product enhancements to enhance the adoption of the essure procedure 
this may involve working with the various regulatory agencies around the world that regulate the sale and labeling of medical devices to provide updates to claims such as effectiveness and placement rates 
where appropriate  we will make physical improvements to the product for improved manufacturability or for the ease of use by the physician 
we have experienced significant operating losses since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our operating losses to continue until at least the end of calendar year as we continue to expend substantial resources in the selling and marketing of the essure system in the united states and abroad 
due to the unpredictable nature of these activities  we do not know whether we will achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we will continue to be in a net loss position until sufficient revenues can be generated to offset expenses 
in august  we completed a private placement of our common stock  which generated cash to help fund our operations 
in the future  depending upon a variety of factors  we may need to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
additional financing may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
critical accounting estimates and policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the primary estimates underlying the company s financial statements include reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  product warranty  impairment reserves for long lived assets  income taxes and contingent liabilities 
other accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies to our financial statements 
application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
we have international distributors in france  australia and canada 
our revenue recognition policy for distributors is consistent with our policy for direct customers 
we entered into written distribution contracts with our distributors with fixed terms and price and consider delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
we do not currently accept product returns from customers or distributors 
we may in the future decide to accept returns from customers or distributors  which will significantly change our revenue recognition policy and could materially impact our financial statements 
we may be required to defer all of our revenues until sufficient historical data is established to support an adequate return reserve 
we may receive non recurring payments from contractual arrangements which are deferred and recognized as revenue when earned based on an appropriate basis and time frame such as when services are performed or the term of the contract 
additionally  we require physicians to be preceptored for between and cases by a certified trainer before being able to perform the procedure independently 
there are no revenues associated with the training activities 
we do not charge a fee for the activity and no commitment arises for the physician from the preceptorship 
physician training is provided upfront and we have no obligation subsequent to the initial training 
training costs have not been significant to date 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
we have not experienced any significant write off of potentially excess and obsolete inventories in the past 
however  this could change as we increase inventory purchases to satisfy product demand 
if sales expectations and inventory purchases become mismatched and are not adjusted timely  we may experience material write offs in the future 
in addition  we evaluate our inventory on a quarterly basis to ensure that our inventory valuation does not exceed net realizable value 
although unlikely  if we experience a significant drop in our average selling price that is below our actual cost of goods  we may incur significant write downs of inventory 
accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
our exposure to credit losses may change as we increase our receivables 
changes in customer type and mix  as well as domestic and international economic climate  will also impact potential credit losses 
we may decide to change our bad debt reserve methodology in the future to better estimate credit losses 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established  we might not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
warranty accrual 
we offer warranties on our product and record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with warranty claims  which is based upon historical experiences and our estimate of the level of future costs 
warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as a cost of goods sold 
warranty expense will increase as and if we increase our net sales 
warranty reserve rates may change when we change manufacturing process or change our third party manufacturing contractor 
although our warranty expenses have historically been within our expectations and the accrual established  we may not continue to experience the same warranty expense rate that we have in the past 
impairment of long lived assets 
we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of our property and equipment and the essure license acquired from a patent litigation settlement in see note to consolidated financial statements  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
our net long lived assets as of december  and december  included property and equipment of million and million  respectively  and other identifiable intangible assets of million and million  respectively 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
any such valuation allowance would be based on our management estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets would be recoverable 
contingent liabilities 
we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency shall be accrued when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate 
nevertheless  the actual loss from a loss contingency might differ from our estimates 
results of operations this section should be read in conjunction with item  business  on part i of this form k 
years ended december  and net sales net sales were million in  of which were from united states  were from europe  and were from other regions 
net sales were million in  of which were from united states  were from europe and were from other regions 
the following table summarizes the above information related to net sales by geographic region in tabular format years ended december  net sales in thousands    united states of america europe other net sales are attributed to region based on the shipping location of the external customers 
the increase in net sales of million or is the result of continued commercialization of the essure system in the united states 
our worldwide average selling price for our product increased from in to in due to the increase in our sales price in january  as well as the increase in the level of domestic sales  which has a higher price than sales to our european distributor 
we expect sales to grow in between and due to the increase in the number of sales representatives  new programs aimed at increasing patient awareness of the essure procedure and new coverage decisions in the area of reimbursement 
in early  we targeted groups of gynecological practices with the goal of training  inclusive of preceptorship  approximately physicians by the end of and ended the year having trained physicians 
as of december   we have a total of  doctors that have either completed or are in the process of completing preceptorship 
our accomplishment in obtaining the number of physicians trained is very important because it not only provides us with a strong referral base within major metropolitan areas we have targeted  but it will also create the leverage to help us gain additional reimbursement coverage 
in addition  there are no revenues associated with the training activities 
we do not charge a fee for the activity and no commitment arises for the physician from the preceptorship 
physician training is provided upfront and we have no obligation subsequent to the initial training 
training costs have not been significant to date 
gross profit cost of goods sold increased by million to million in as compared to million in gross profit increased million to million from million in our gross profit percent was and for the years and  respectively 
our gross profit percent was in the fourth quarter of  as compared to in the fourth quarter of and it increased from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of the improvement in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of our domestic price increase and the transition of the manufacturing activities in to a third party manufacturer in mexico 
this outsourcing effort decreased our production costs and increased gross profit 
in april  we received fda approval for the process at the third party manufacturer 
operating expenses research and development expenses  which include clinical  regulatory and product development  increased by million to million in as compared to million in research and development expenditures fluctuate in relation to product development  clinical affairs and regulatory activities 
we intend to continue to focus our research and development efforts on the development of new or alternative product designs and enhancements along with management of the on going clinical trials 
it is r d s goal to launch product enhancements over the coming years  which are intended to result in a lower cost of goods  improved ease of use of the essure system and simplified packaging systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in the primary reason for the increase results from higher expenditures in million for the expansion of our us field sales force by approximately sales representatives during  which is meant to provide us with more selling time to focus on physician penetration 
additionally  increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were a result of million in headcount increase in departments other than sales  million for the accrual of bonuses for  million in the creation of a new department in sales  million in training programs  expenditures of million related to the move of our headquarters to new facilities located in mountain view  california  million in consulting fees for the development and enhancement of our internet website  million in legal expenditures  million in sales consulting and million in recruiting of new sales employees  offset by million in lower sales expenditures in australia  lower expenses of million in sales and training related to the termination of the agreement with gynecare  for the reduction of sarbanes oxley compliance and technology consulting fees and lower marketing expenses of million 
in addition  we had limited international expenditures in  since we completed the divestiture of our french subsidiary in january and the closure of our direct operations in australia in january from the latter  all severance costs were completely paid out at the end of january as of december   all fixed assets have been disposed of  although the dissolution of the legal entity remains 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in the future mainly due to the expansion of our sales force to support our revenue growth and expand market penetration 
other income and expenses interest and other income and expenses of million increased by million in compared to million in the increase is due to higher interest income in due to higher interest rates applied to the investments portfolio 
income taxes as a result of our net loss of million  we incurred no income tax expense in as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  these carryforwards will begin to expire starting in for federal purposes and for state purposes 
in addition  at december   we had federal and state research credit carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
if not utilized  the federal tax carryforward will begin to expire in  while the state carryforward does not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization and in the event we have had a change of ownership  utilization of the carryforwards could be restricted 
restricted stock we granted  shares and  shares of restricted stock to our employees and directors during and  respectively 
certain of the grants include acceleration of vesting based upon our achievement of performance goals 
from these grants   shares were repurchased by us in  which are recorded as treasury stock  and with the  shares repurchased in fiscal year  we hold as of december  a total of  shares of treasury stock 
the purchase price was per share and the company s repurchase right with respect to the shares lapses either in equal installments over three years or at the end of the three years  depending on the terms of the agreement 
we are amortizing the net total deferred restricted stock expense of million  calculated based on the fair value of the stock on the date of the grants  over the vesting term of three years on a straight line basis 
of the total deferred restricted stock expense of million  million will relate to research and development and million will relate to selling  general and administrative activities  assuming employees will not change departments 
years ended december  and net sales net sales were million in  of which were from the united states  were from europe and were from other regions 
net sales were million in  of which were from united states  were from europe and were from other regions 
the following table summarizes the above information related to net sales by geographic region in tabular format years ended december  net sales in thousands   united states of america europe other the increase in net sales of million or is the result of continued commercialization of the essure system in the united states 
our worldwide average selling price decreased from in to in as a direct result of terminating the company s direct operations in europe and subsequently selling through a distributor  which has a lower selling price 
as of december   we had a total of  doctors that had either completed or were in the process of completing preceptorship 
as of december  the same group was comprised of physicians 
gross profit cost of goods sold increased by million to million in as compared to million in in our gross profit increased million to million from million in our gross profit percent was and for the year and  respectively 
our gross profit percent was in the fourth quarter of as compared to in the fourth quarter of the improvement in gross profit percentage was primarily due to an increase in production volume and a decrease in production costs 
during  we transitioned our manufacturing activities to a third party manufacturer in mexico 
this outsourcing effort decreased our production costs and increased our gross profit 
operating expenses research and development expenses  which include clinical  regulatory and product development  decreased by million to million in as compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the completion of activities pertaining to the pma application process and completion of certain research and development projects 
a decrease in the headcount resulted in a reduction of million of payroll related expenses 
other factors that contributed to the decrease were a million decrease in travel expenses  a decrease of million in clinical expenses related to the completion of the pma application process and a million decrease in consulting expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in as compared to million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in international sales expense as a result of the sale of the subsidiary in france in early  a million decrease in legal fees as a result of the settlement of the ovion case in october  a million decrease in payroll related expenses for marketing and us physician training  a million decrease in expenses as a result of severance for former officers and recruitment of a new ceo in  a million decrease in expense for demonstration units due to the shift toward reusable demonstration units and a shift from large group to a smaller individual training program  a million decrease in advertising and a million decrease in travel expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in consulting and audit expenses for sarbanes oxley compliance 
in addition  we recorded expenses of approximately  in december related to the close down of our australia operations  which included  of severance costs and  for the impairment of fixed assets 
all severance costs were completely paid out at the end of january other income and expenses interest and other income and expenses of million in decreased by million compared to million in due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
r  share based payments revised 
the provisions of sfas no 
r will require us to measure all stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in the consolidated financial statements  including grants of employee stock options 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
r will require additional accounting related to the income tax effects and additional disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas no 
r is effective for all public companies for annual periods beginning after june  we will adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of and we have not yet determined whether this adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
we have not determined the method of transition or the reasonably likely effect in the financial statements as we are evaluating the requirements for sfas no 
r 
nevertheless  we expect the adoption to have a significant adverse impact on our statement of operations and net loss per share 
in march  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 which provides guidance for the implementation of sfas no 
r with respect to valuation techniques  expected volatility and expected term for valuing employee stock options among other matters 
the provisions of sab no

 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 

sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
apb opinion no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of the changing to the new accounting principle 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have evaluated the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
 and do not believe the impact will be significant to our overall results of operations or financial position 
in august  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin to clarify that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or the method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  december  for calendar year companies 
the adoption of the provisions of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in september  the emerging issues task force the task force issued eitf statement  determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination eitf 
the task force reached a consensus that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or that are placed in service significantly after  and not contemplated at or near the beginning of  the lease term should be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewal periods that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased 
eitf applies to leasehold improvements that are purchased or acquired in reporting periods beginning after june  the adoption of the provisions of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have experienced significant operating losses since inception 
as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through equity financings 
in february we completed a private placement of approximately million shares of common stock at per share 
our net proceeds from were approximately million  after deducting offering costs and commissions 
in addition  in august  we finalized a second private placement of approximately million shares of common stock at a price of and per share 
our net proceeds  which were approximately million after deducting offering costs  are being used to fund operations 
in the future  depending upon a variety of factors  we may need to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we have been exposed to interest rate risk through interest earned on holdings of available for sale marketable securities 
interest rates that may affect these items in the future will depend on market conditions and may differ from the rates we have experienced in the past 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since we reduce the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining an investment portfolio  which is primarily comprised of highly rated  marketable securities 
we do not hold or issue derivatives  commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk our expenses  except for those related to australia  were denominated in united states dollars 
our revenues in foreign currencies were  and in  and  respectively  which were nominal in relation to our overall financial position 
as a result  we have low exposure for currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if our assessment of our foreign currency exposure changes  we may consider hedging transactions for risk mitigation
