item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
item business general dade behring holdings  inc also referred to as we  us  our and dade behring is a leading manufacturer and distributor of diagnostic products and services to clinical laboratories 
we serve approximately billion of the billion annual worldwide market for clinical diagnostic products and sell primarily to the central lab  which are typically hospital based or stand alone reference laboratories and represent approximately billion of the total market 
we manufacture and market a broad offering of diagnostic products and services which include medical diagnostic instruments  reagents and consumables  and maintenance services 
as of december   we had a worldwide installed base of approximately  diagnostic instruments  an increase of approximately from within our served markets  we have a strong position in each of our core businesses  which are chemistry  hemostasis  microbiology and infectious disease diagnostics 
in december  bain capital  inc and the gs capital partners  lp and certain of their affiliates formed dade international  inc  and acquired certain assets of baxter diagnostics from baxter international  inc the assets acquired from baxter international  inc included established leadership positions in hemostasis and microbiology  strong routine chemistry immunoassay market positions and an extensive sales and service organization  especially in the united states us 
in may  we purchased dupont s diagnostic business  which had entered into the automated clinical chemistry market in with the introduction of the first random access automated chemistry analyzer in the world 
this acquisition provided us with a strong position in the routine chemistry market  and world class manufacturing and product development capabilities 
in october  we acquired behring diagnostics  the clinical diagnostic business of hoechst ag  and created dade behring inc behring diagnostics was established in by emil von behring  the recipient of the first nobel prize in medicine 
this acquisition provided us with complementary products for our hemostasis and routine immunochemistry product lines and significantly broadened the overall product line portfolio by adding leadership positions in plasma protein testing and drugs of abuse testing therapeutic drug monitoring 
it also expanded our capabilities in instrumentation development  specialty assay development and research  and extended the geographic scope of our business 
on august   dade behring holdings  inc and certain of its wholly owned direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of title of the united states bankruptcy code  as amended  with the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois 
the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan of reorganization on september  and the plan of reorganization became effective on october  diagnostic industry overview clinical diagnostic tests are used to analyze samples of patients bodily fluids such as whole blood  blood plasma  serum or urine in a clinical setting 
in a single test  a patient sample may be measured to determine the presence  concentration or absence of a particular substance or condition 
in some tests  the fluid sample is combined with a biochemical reagent  which is then observed or measured to detect physical or chemical changes that have a predetermined correlation to diagnostic information 
the test result enables physicians to diagnose  treat and monitor patients 
the most frequently ordered diagnostic tests are traditional routine clinical chemistry tests that measure substances  such as glucose  cholesterol or sodium  as part of routine blood checks 
other diagnostic tests measure other bodily functions such as blood clotting ability and cardiac function  or measure the presence of infections or drugs 
by providing accurate and timely patient diagnosis and treatment  the wide range and important nature of these tests have established diagnostic testing as an integral part of medical practice 
increasingly  diagnostic testing is recognized as making a significant contribution to improving patient care and lowering total patient costs 
while diagnostic tests are performed in a number of different settings  including hospitals  reference laboratories  physicians offices ambulatory care centers  criminal justice system specialty labs and homes  the vast majority occur in hospitals and reference laboratories 
diagnostic testing systems are composed of instruments  reagents  consumables  service and data management components 
instruments  which represent approximately of our revenue  serve to automate repetitive manual tasks  improve test accuracy and speed results reporting 
reagents are biochemical substances that react with the patient sample to produce measurable  objective results 
the consumable accessories vary across application segments  but are generally items such as vessels used in generating test results 
reagents and consumables that are exclusive to their related testing systems represent closed systems  which generally provide more predictable future revenue to the system supplier 
open systems accept reagents and consumables from more than a single manufacturer 
sample handling and preparation devices and data management systems are becoming increasingly important components of the clinical diagnostic system 
these additional system components permit laboratories to achieve cost efficiencies and higher test volumes 
the global clinical diagnostics market is comprised of approximately  hospital and reference laboratories 
improving productivity is a primary focus area for many of these labs given the ongoing cost pressures within the healthcare industry and the growing shortage of qualified individuals to work in clinical labs 
the global clinical diagnostics market is estimated at billion annually  with the united states  western europe and japan comprising approximately  and  respectively  of the global market 
we primarily serve the clinical laboratory market  which comprises billion of the billion global clinical diagnostics market 
we believe that the global clinical diagnostics market will continue to grow due to a number of key favorable industry trends  including demographic shifts resulting from the aging of the population and socioeconomic improvements that are expected to increase the overall level of demand for diagnostic testing  increased focus on lowering total healthcare expenditures that will likely increase demand for diagnostic testing as an effective tool to improve patient outcomes and reduce the costs of misdiagnosis through earlier and more accurate diagnosis and patient monitoring  emerging markets that will likely provide additional demand as economic growth in these countries lead to increased per capita healthcare expenditures  technology improvements in new tests  pathogens and markers that will likely result in the increased use of diagnostics to aid in the diagnosis of diseases  and increased automation of diagnostic instruments that is expected to lower the overall cost of diagnostic testing and thereby increase accessibility and demand 
dade behring served markets we derive substantially all of our revenues from manufacturing and marketing clinical diagnostics products and services 
we are organized functionally and are comprised of three reporting segments global customer management gcm americas  gcm international  and global operations 
gcm americas and gcm international are our sales  marketing  customer training  technical support and field service organizations 
global operations primarily includes all manufacturing  distribution and research and development activities  and accordingly does not recognize significant revenue 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for information related to risks from our operations outside the us and segment and geographic area financial information  respectively 
this and the following sections discuss our served markets whose results are reported in the gcm americas and gcm international segments 
chemistry 
our chemistry business consists of four product lines routine chemistry immunochemistry  cardiac  plasma proteins and drugs of abuse testing therapeutic drug monitoring 
these product lines comprised approximately billion or of our revenue during the clinical laboratory chemistry immunochemistry testing segment represents approximately billion of the total clinical diagnostics market 
routine chemistry immunochemistry 
routine chemistry tests measure substances found in large concentrations in patients blood  tissue  urine or other bodily fluids 
some of these substances include chemistry tests  such as for cholesterol  glucose  iron and sodium and their concentration levels  which provide information on a patient s basic bodily functions 
immunochemistry testing relies on the properties of antibodies and antigens in the immune system as its key detection mechanism to measure relatively low concentrations of these substances found in blood 
historically  analyzers have been developed separately for routine chemistry and immunochemistry testing 
today  high frequency tests from both categories are rapidly being consolidated on to a single system that significantly improves overall laboratory productivity and costs 
on average  hospital laboratories operate approximately three routine chemistry and or immunochemistry analyzers 
these instruments account for up to of the volume of all diagnostic tests performed in clinical laboratories and are characterized by their high throughput capabilities 
we develop  market and sell dimension analyzers  which are the only systems in the market that combine both routine chemistry and immunoassay testing into one analyzer 
we have consistently been a leader in chemistry immunochemistry instrument consolidation and automation  beginning with the introduction of the heterogeneous immunoassay testing module for our mid volume dimension rxl analyzer 
in we introduced the dimension xpand analyzer  which provides the same testing consolidation capability as the dimension rxl analyzer  for smaller labs 
the continued consolidation of routine chemistry and immunochemistry testing on to a single analyzer continues to represent a significant growth opportunity for us 
we believe that our dimension line of products offers customers a broad test menu and cost efficiencies for performing these two categories of tests since the analyzers have the potential to improve test turnaround times and significantly reduce labor requirements 
we are continually enhancing our existing menu of over tests  and are currently developing new ones to expand our capabilities in this largest segment of the clinical diagnostics market 
in  we introduced the dimension rxlmax analyzer  the most recent version of our mid volume chemistry immunochemistry analyzer  which included several significant system improvements 
similarly  at the end of  we introduced our latest low volume system  the dimension xpand plus analyzer  which included enhancements similar to our mid volume instrument 
in  we introduced the streamlab workcell  which has the capability to connect multiple dimension systems with onboard pre analytical capabilities of accessioning  centrifugation and aliquotting 
the streamlab workcell automates steps that are essential to laboratory processes for producing test results 
at the end of  we enhanced the streamlab workcell by providing connectivity for up to six dimension systems and to the immulite immunoassay system manufactured by diagnostics products corporation 
this workcell provides our customers in high volume laboratories with an integrated single platform solution 
in  we introduced a mid volume laboratory automation solution  the dimension lynx system 
our approach to workstation consolidation is unique 
we integrate the immunoassay detection capability into the chemistry analyzer itself rather than simply connecting separate chemistry and immunochemistry instruments with a common patient sample test tube handling system 
integration of testing into one analyzer provides greater asset productivity  lower labor costs and faster turnaround times 
our strong reputation for servicing our instruments and our commitment to improving operating efficiency are among the reasons why the dimension product line remains attractive to clinical laboratories 
staffing and budget concerns in clinical laboratories worldwide suggest that laboratory process integration and instrument consolidation will become even more compelling to our customers over time 
building on our success in workstation consolidation  we are currently developing a next generation system for high volume laboratories  the dimension vista system 
the initial version of the system will serve the high volume testing segment  which represents nearly half of the billion chemistry immunochemistry testing market  and the system architecture will provide the basic building blocks for new consolidated instruments designed to serve mid and low volume laboratories 
with the exception of streamlab  we currently do not have a product offering that specifically serves the high volume chemistry immunochemistry market 
in addition to targeting further labor efficiencies in the lab  the dimension vista system will also have the unique capability of consolidating a currently independent testing discipline  nephelometric plasma protein testing  by integrating a nephelometer into the system 
we anticipate commercialization of the dimension vista system in the second half of as with all new products we introduce  the rollout will be controlled 
thus  we expect little to no revenue impact in  with market penetration and revenue increasing over the course of see item a 
risk factors for a discussion of risk factors related to the release of new products 
cardiac 
cardiac tests are used for both risk assessment and diagnosis of cardiovascular disease cvd 
the cardiac market is one of the highest growth segments of the broader immunochemistry market  growing at approximately annually 
we have a leading share in the market for cardiac tests and were one of the first to introduce a widely adopted testing system for the cardiac proteins troponin i  ck mb and myoglobin 
in we introduced the nt probnp test  a rapidly growing cardiac marker used to assist physicians in the diagnosis of congestive heart failure chf 
the combination of rapid and accurate tests for these cvd markers has allowed for rapid diagnosis of cardiac disease and has enhanced the physician s ability for triage and diagnosis of chest pain in patients 
we offer a unique combination of platforms for performing cardiac tests 
in the central lab  the dimension analyzers  bn ii  and bn prospec analyzers offer tests for cardiac risk assessment such as cholesterol  hdl  ldl  apolipoprotein  and high sensitivity crp 
we have been the market leader in the development of high sensitivity crp testing for cardiac application 
in addition to cardiac risk assessment tests  the dimension analyzers menu also includes the four major cardiac disease tests troponin i  ck mb  myoglobin for cardiac necrosis  and nt probnp for helping in the diagnosis of chf 
in the acute care near patient setting  we offer cardiac testing on our stratus cs acute care diagnostic system 
being able to standardize cardiac testing between our laboratory and acute care platforms provides us with a unique position in the market  because it is important that physicians be confident that the results from the acute care platform will clinically match those that come from the laboratory 
plasma protein 
plasma protein systems test serum  plasma  urine or cerebral spinal fluid to help diagnose diseases  such as coronary heart diseases and rheumatic diseases  as well as to detect disorders  such as tumors  renal failure  inflammation  anemia  gammopathies and malnutrition 
in  we introduced outside the united states the first automated nephelometric test to diagnose chronic alcohol abuse 
plasma protein tests are conducted on two types of instrument platforms routine chemistry immunochemistry analyzers such as our dimension instrument line  and dedicated nephelometers such as our bn ii and bn prospec instruments 
while a higher proportion of protein tests are run on routine chemistry immunochemistry systems  the high sensitivity and broad test menu make nephelometers a practical option for customers who need this utility 
we are the market leader in the worldwide nephelometric plasma protein testing 
drugs of abuse testing dat therapeutic drug monitoring tdm 
drug tests are used to measure the level of therapeutic drugs or presence of drugs of abuse  usually in either blood or urine 
tdm tests assist physicians in ensuring that the level of therapeutic drugs patients receive reach appropriate levels to treat a condition  but do not exceed safe ranges in the bloodstream 
an example of a tdm application is testing performed on transplant patients to monitor the level of immunosuppressive drugs that they are given 
drugs of abuse tests screen for the presence of illicit substances such as cocaine and marijuana 
because of their range of application  drugs tests are used at a variety of sites  from clinical laboratories to employers offices 
we are a worldwide market leader in drug testing with a comprehensive menu of tests 
we offer drug tests on our dimension analyzers 
in  we also began marketing the mid to high volume v twin analyzer for the syva product line  and in we began marketing the mid volume viva e analyzer 
vital scientific nv manufactures these systems and we distribute them worldwide 
both are configured to run our emit branded drugs of abuse  therapeutic drugs and serum toxicology assays  as well as specimen validity tests 
vital scientific is currently developing the viva jr  an easy to use  compact benchtop analyzer dedicated to drug testing  which we expect to begin marketing in the first half of we also have ready to use liquid dat and tdm reagents for a broad range of other commercially available instrument platforms  which makes syva an attractive choice for dat assays among open system providers 
hemostasis 
hemostasis testing measures a patient s ability to form and dissolve blood clots  a critical factor in the stabilization of the cardiovascular system 
hemostasis testing can be segmented into routine screening and specialty tests 
routine hemostasis tests are typically performed before and during surgical procedures 
hemostasis testing is essential in post surgical monitoring of anticoagulant treatments that thin the blood to prevent clotting 
specialty tests are performed to further characterize patients with coagulation disorders such as hemophilia  or other congenital or acquired disease states 
we offer a broad range of instruments that perform both routine and specialty tests to meet the needs of customers from small hospitals to large reference labs 
with revenue of approximately million during  we continued to maintain a global leadership position in hemostasis testing through our commitment to the innovation of new and improved products and services 
the hemostasis product line continues to lead competitors in number of new systems placed and in overall reagent usage and market share 
we offer our bcs analyzer to high volume and specialty laboratories and distribute instruments manufactured by sysmex corporation to the high volume routine assay reference lab market and to mid and low volume laboratories  such as community hospitals 
the pfa analyzer is a fully automated system which determines platelet function by mimicking how platelets adhere  aggregate  and form a plug in the presence of an agonist  either collagen adp or collagen epinephrine 
the result is known as closure time  and has utility as an excellent screen for the bleeding disorder von willebrand s disease  as well as new cardiac utility in measuring the functional response of platelets to aspirin 
we believe this will be a high growth market as new anti platelet therapies are developed and introduced 
we expect market growth to come from continued growth in the aging population  the increasing number of surgeries performed  and from new hemostasis tests  that more accurately measure blood clotting and allow for improved patient treatment 
microbiology 
we serve the automated and manual identification antibiotic susceptibility testing id ast microbiology market with our microscan products 
microbiology laboratories use microscan products to identify infection causing bacteria such as streptococci and staphylococci  and to determine the minimum concentration of antibiotic  such as erythromycin and ampicillin  necessary to inhibit or kill the bacteria 
this information is critical to the optimum management of patient therapy 
microscan revenues were approximately million during  and were derived almost entirely from the automated portion of the id ast market 
the market for automated id ast testing is approximately million within an overall microbiology market of billion 
at the core of our product line is a patented dry reagent panel 
available as individual testing components  our combination panels provide both organism identification and the susceptibility information using a broad selection of antibiotics to meet formulary needs and streamlined workflow for operator efficiency 
our microscan walkaway si analyzer and walkaway si analyzer are fully automated systems that utilize a dual technology optic system to process colorimetric and fluorogenic panel types simultaneously 
the autoscan analyzer provides semi automated processing solutions for low volume testing needs of conventional laboratories 
all of our analyzers are supported by our microscan microbiology systems labpro information management system and our optional alert system 
designed by microbiologists  these informatics tools provide customizable functionality to enhance the management of test results 
we are a leader in the automated id ast microbiology market 
we have maintained this position by focusing on higher growth non us markets and developing improved capabilities for our instrumentation  software and panels to help laboratories reduce their overall costs 
in the united states  we continue to secure business by promoting our conventional technology  which utilizes direct susceptibility testing methods and results in optimal detection of emerging antimicrobial resistance 
microscan systems were the first automated systems to detect both vancomycin intermediate and vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus during routine testing  demonstrating our leadership in providing highly accurate susceptibility test results 
in  we introduced our synergies plus panels  which offer two hour organism identification and read when ready antibiotic susceptibility test results 
this new line of panels and software will provide more rapid test results on organisms that are slow to express resistance and will enhance patient outcomes without compromising our reputation for accuracy 
continued evolutions in the microbiology testing market have been driven primarily by advances in automation  new antibiotics  the complexity of various microbes  and the increasing resistance of microbes to antibiotics 
infectious disease diagnostics 
infectious disease diagnostic systems test for the presence of infectious microorganisms 
this market consists of bacteriology  parasitology and virology testing  including hiv and hepatitis testing 
these tests are used not only to diagnose disease  but also as screening tests in order to insure a safe blood supply 
we have a niche position in infectious disease diagnostics 
infectious disease testing is one of the largest segments of the diagnostics testing market  but accounted for approximately million or of our revenue during the microtitre plate mtp subsegment  manual  semi automated and fully automated  makes up approximately one third of the immunoassay testing in this segment 
mtp is a high throughput  low cost testing method that is ideal for blood banks  large hospitals and commercial laboratories 
in the european mtp segment  our bep systems are used by more laboratories than any other batch analyzer 
in addition  we possess a strong intellectual property position for hiv o  a variant of hiv 
due to the prevalence of hiv o  any future hiv testing platform will need to include hiv o to offer comprehensive hiv testing capability 
we continue to invest in expanded test menu capabilities for our existing instrument line to allow us to better serve the high volume blood bank market 
these instruments have met with positive acceptance by a number of european and asian blood banks 
sales and marketing we have a global customer management organization that includes elements beyond traditional sales representatives and marketing personnel  such as healthcare consultants  clinical quality initiatives managers  field service engineers  national accounts group purchasing organization management  integrated delivery networks management  inside sales  clinical application specialists  customer service representatives  technical assistance  customer operations  pricing analysts and field sales and service management 
our global customer management executives have long tenure in both the clinical diagnostics industry and with our company 
similarly  the experience profile of our customer contact personnel is generally one of long service in the industry and with our company 
we utilize a generalist sales force approach  but all countries with significant sales of specific products have specialists who are trained to service specific product lines 
because of the sales volume and market penetration of our chemistry immunochemistry  microbiology  hemostasis  cardiac risk assessment  protein and therapeutic drug products  most sales representatives  specialists and generalists are familiar with the features and benefits of these products 
we use a dedicated health systems sales team in the united states that focuses exclusively on serving the larger hospital networks and reference laboratories  which represent an increasingly important portion of our customer base as the healthcare industry continues to consolidate 
our products are presented to customers through most of the larger group purchasing arrangements serving hospital and reference laboratories 
our health systems sales organization provides overlay support for individual sales representatives 
our key focus is on providing solutions to the challenges our customers face within their laboratories  which are primarily cost pressures  skilled labor shortages and space constraints 
we have developed both healthcare solutions and clinical quality initiative organizations to identify and find ways to provide customized solutions for our customers 
among others  areas we focus on include workflow analysis  improved testing turnaround time  workstation consolidation  patient specimen filing and storage and ways to ensure integrity of patient information 
in addition  we provide educational opportunities for our customers through seminars  audio conferences  newsletters and websites 
our customer management organization has a long history and strong reputation for delivering the highest quality customer satisfaction in the clinical diagnostics industry 
research and development we conduct research and development in the united states and in germany 
research and development activities are grouped into two primary categories across all product segments instrument platform development and test menu development 
our instrument platform development efforts are focused on the design of new instrumentation and software that brings increased automation and functionality to clinical laboratories 
customers value broad test menus  quick turnaround of patient samples  integration of multiple laboratory functions  automation of non value added activities  minimal space utilization  ease of use and the opportunity to lower operating costs 
our test menu development efforts seek to improve the efficacy of existing products and to develop new tests that extend our existing product offerings 
our research and development teams are skilled in a number of engineering and scientific disciplines including focus areas of chemistry immunochemistry  microbiology  hemostasis  informatics  applying robotics to sample processing and systems engineering 
we develop our products internally using a multifunctional team approach which integrates our internal capabilities of engineering and assay development with regulatory and quality systems  marketing  technical support and manufacturing 
although we continue to develop or license all of our hemostasis reagents and controls  we have sourced new hemostasis instruments through an external instrumentation partner using a similar multifunction approach in recent years 
research and development expense was million in  as compared to million in and million in patents  trademarks and licenses we own or have licensed over  patents in the united states and other countries that relate to our products and business and have also developed brand names and trademarks for our products 
we own numerous united states and non us registered trademarks and service marks and have applications for the registration of trademarks and service marks pending around the world 
we also own several united states copyright registrations 
in addition  we own a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how 
further  we license certain intellectual property rights from third parties 
our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property 
in each of our business segments  these patents  patent applications  trademarks  copyrights and licenses are  in the aggregate  of significant importance to our business 
however  we believe that no single product related patent  trademark or copyright or related group of patents  trademarks or copyrights is material in relation to our business as a whole 
competition while the clinical diagnostics industry is highly competitive  there are substantial barriers to entry including the necessity for significant sales  service and distribution infrastructure  research and development infrastructure that requires engineering and informatics skills necessary to design and commercialize complex instruments as well as the life science skills necessary to develop the diagnostic tests  and the highly regulated environment for our products 
we encounter competition from u 
s and non us manufacturers who compete in some or all of the markets we serve 
some of our competitors are large  diversified healthcare companies with substantial resources 
our competitors include abbott laboratories  bayer ag  beckman coulter  becton dickinson  biomerieux  johnson johnson  roche and diagnostica stago 
we believe that in recent years  the key competitive factors for diagnostic testing products have been quality  service  price and ease of use 
for automated and consolidated instrument platforms  menu breadth is of increasing importance 
regulatory matters most aspects of our business are subject to some degree of government regulation in the countries in which we operate 
in addition to regulations intended to ensure product safety and effectiveness  our business is subject to environment and occupational health and safety regulations 
for some products  and in some countries  government regulation is significant and  in general  there is a trend towards more stringent regulation 
our policy is to comply fully with all regulatory requirements that apply to our products and operations 
failure to comply with government regulations can have significant consequences 
governmental regulatory actions can result in the recall or seizure of products  suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for production or sale and other civil  monetary and criminal sanctions 
in the united states  the medical device and clinical diagnostic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal  state and local agencies  primarily regarding product manufacturing  safety  efficacy and labeling 
government agencies in the united states as well as other countries have expressed concern about the costs of healthcare and in some cases have focused attention on the use of diagnostic tests 
regulations in these areas already exist in some countries and may be expanded significantly in the united states and other countries in the future 
we devote significant time  effort and expense to address regulatory requirements applicable to our business 
our quality and regulatory compliance training and well established manufacturing practices have consistently allowed us to successfully introduce and maintain the manufacturing and distribution of instrument and reagent products that satisfy regulatory standards as well as our customers requirements for quality 
although we are unable to predict the extent to which our business may be affected by future regulatory developments  we expect that our own business would not be disproportionately burdened by future regulation 
we believe that the integration we have achieved between our engineering and life sciences capabilities and our substantial experience addressing and accommodating regulatory requirements and restrictions on our operations throughout the world will allow us to continue to develop and introduce new and improved products and enable us to compete effectively within this environment 
raw materials we purchase raw materials  which include various biological and chemical products  from a variety of suppliers 
while some of our principal raw materials are available from multiple sources  we elect to purchase certain raw materials from sole suppliers for various reasons eg  quality assurance  cost effectiveness or regulatory approval requirements 
other raw materials that we use are not available from multiple sources 
in some cases where there are regulatory requirements relating to the qualification of suppliers  we may not be able to establish additional or replacement sources on a timely basis 
while we work closely with our suppliers to ensure continuity of supply  the termination  reduction or interruption in supply of these sole sourced raw materials could affect our ability to manufacture and sell certain of our products and to achieve anticipated production and sales levels 
employees as of january   we had approximately  full time and part time employees  of which approximately  were in the united states 
the remaining employees were serving at various locations around the world 
our us employees are not represented by collective bargaining groups 
we have had no significant difficulty attracting qualified professionals 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be very positive

risk factors 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
our failure to compete with other manufacturers in the highly competitive clinical diagnostics industry  some of which have greater financial resources than we do  could harm our ability to retain existing customers and obtain future business 
the clinical diagnostics industry is highly competitive and we encounter competition from several international manufacturers in both us and non us markets 
some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater resources  financial and other  than we do 
moreover  we encounter different competitors in each of our key product lines and we cannot assure you that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our profit margins and business approach may be adversely affected by potential healthcare reform 
substantially all of our sales are in the clinical diagnostics industry 
healthcare reform and the growth of managed care organizations have been considerable forces in the diagnostics industry 
these forces continue to place constraints on the levels of overall pricing and thus could have a material adverse effect on the profit margins of our products 
such continuing changes in the united states healthcare market could also force us to alter our approach to selling  marketing  distributing and servicing our customer base 
in and outside the united states  including germany and japan in particular  changes to government reimbursement policies could reduce the funding that healthcare service providers have to spend on diagnostic products  which could have a material adverse impact on our sales and or profit margin 
we make significant investments in research and development  but there is no guarantee that any of these investments will ultimately result in a commercial product that will generate revenues 
our products require the integration of many component systems and processes including electromechanical  information systems and biochemical reactions or assays 
each year we expend significant resources in the development of new products that incorporate these systems 
for the year ended december   we spent approximately million on research and development expenses 
notwithstanding these investments  we may be unable to successfully design or develop any or all of these components or to integrate them into viable commercial systems 
we might also encounter substantial delays in getting products to market in a timely fashion 
if our success in introducing such products is less than we anticipate  we may not be able to recover all of our capitalized new product development costs  and the write down of unrecoverable costs could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition 
changes in our business strategy or plans may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
if our business strategy or plans change  whether in response to changes in economic conditions or developments in the diagnostics industry  or otherwise  we may be required to expend significantly more resources than planned to develop and implement any new business strategy or plans 
the expense of any such change could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united states  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations 
approximately of our sales and a significant portion of our earnings are attributable to operations conducted outside of the united states 
the united states dollar value of sales and earnings of these operations varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal obligations on our united states dollar denominated debt 
our planned hedging of other currencies against the united states dollar may not adequately reduce exposure to currency exchange fluctuation 
our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we own or license over  united states and non us patents and have numerous patent applications pending around the world 
we own numerous united states and non us registered trademarks and service marks and have applications for the registration of trademarks and service marks pending around the world 
we also own several united states copyright registrations 
in addition  we own a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know how 
further  we license certain intellectual property rights from third parties 
our ability to compete depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property 
there can be no assurance as to the degree of protection offered by the various patents  the likelihood that patents will be issued on pending patent applications  or  with regard to the licensed intellectual property  that the licenses will not be terminated 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop around the patented aspects of any of our current or proposed products  independently develop technology or know how that is the same as or competitive with our technology and know how or otherwise obtain access to our intellectual property 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or proposed products  our revenues and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we are subject to regulation by various us federal  state and us agencies  which requires us to comply with regulations in the design  manufacture and distribution of most of our products and violation of such regulations could adversely affect us 
most of our products and operations are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and various other federal and state agencies  as well as by a number of non us governmental agencies 
fda regulations require that most of our new products have pre marketing approval by the fda  or prove substantial equivalence through a k notification and also require that most of our products be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practices 
some products and operations are also subject to regulation by the united states drug enforcement agency  or dea  and various other federal and state agencies  including the united states department of agriculture  or usda  as well as by a number of non us governmental agencies 
dea regulations require that we obtain dea registrations for the bulk manufacture and handling of controlled substances  and maintain effective controls against diversion 
the usda regulates the importation of animal sourced materials and the treatment and handling of animals utilized to derive biological materials used in research or production 
compliance with such regulations substantially increases the time  difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining the approval to manufacture and market newly developed and existing products 
in addition  government regulatory actions can result in the seizure or recall of products  denial  suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for their production and sale and other civil or criminal sanctions 
we are subject to various environmental and occupational health and safety laws and any violation of these laws could result in liability that could adversely affect us 
we are subject to worldwide federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations and are subject to liabilities and compliance costs associated with past and current handling  processing  storing and disposing of hazardous substances and wastes 
our operations are also subject to federal  state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations in and outside the united states 
this requires us to devote significant resources to maintain compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations and to manage environmental risks

additionally  on september   baxter healthcare corporation baxter filed objections to our plan of reorganization 
baxter objected to the adequacy of the disclosure statement filed with the bankruptcy court and to confirmation of the plan of reorganization on a number of bases 
on september   we agreed to settle all matters with baxter for million  such claim to be treated as a general unsecured claim under the plan of reorganization

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of sfas no 
on january   goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will no longer be subject to amortization  but rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
as of january   there was no material impact caused by the initial impairment assessment requirements of sfas no

adjustment adjusted net loss as reported sfas no 
adjustment adjusted the predecessor company s computation of earnings per share was based on the two class method described in sfas no 
 earnings per share 
in computing earnings per share  the current year yield on the class l common stock is separately allocated to class l shareholders except in years the company incurs a loss as class l shareholders are not entitled to a return in such years and  income available to common shareholders income less preferred stock dividends  less current year yield on class l common stock is allocated ratably between class l common stock  common stock  and class b common stock 
any unreturned original cost plus unpaid yield are not components of the earnings per share computations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
statements contained in this report on form k and in our future filings with the securities and exchange commission  in our press releases and in oral statements made by  or with the approval of  authorized personnel that relate to our future performance  including  without limitation  statements with respect to our anticipated financial position  results of operations and level of business for or any other future period  are forward looking statements 
such statements  which are based on current expectations only  are subject to certain risks uncertainties and assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  projected or estimated 
statements included at the beginning of part and in item a 
risk factors describe such risks and uncertainties 
we do not intend to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in the discussion below  we make comparisons on a constant currency basis  which is not a us generally accepted accounting principles gaap defined measure 
we believe this measure provides for a meaningful analysis of the underlying activity since it eliminates the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
when making comparisons on a constant currency basis  we have calculated the change by comparing the applicable reported current year amount to the corresponding amount from the prior year in local currency translated at the foreign currency exchange rates for the current year 
constant currency as defined or presented by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
results of operation we derive substantially all of our revenue from manufacturing and marketing clinical diagnostic products and services 
we are organized functionally and have three reporting segments global customer management gcm americas  gcm international and global operations 
gcm americas and gcm international are our sales and service organizations 
for reporting purposes  gcm americas includes north and south america 
gcm international includes sales and service results from all other continents 
the gross profit margin for the two gcm segments are not materially different 
global operations primarily includes all manufacturing and research and development activities  which occur in the united states and germany  and accordingly does not recognize significant revenues 
global operations functions as a cost center 
consequently  a discussion of gross profit for each individual operating segment would not be meaningful 
generally  global operations does not incur a material amount of our marketing and administrative expense but is responsible for virtually all of our research and development expense 
certain expenses  such as income taxes  general corporate expenses  and financing costs are not allocated to the operating segments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december   totaled  million as compared to  million in the corresponding prior year period 
sales for each segment were as follows in millions year ended december  change gcm americas gcm international global operations total adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes of million  sales increased million or for the year 
on a constant currency basis  sales increased million or in gcm americas and increased million or across gcm international locations 
on a geographic basis  constant currency sales growth was in the us and across all us locations 
the overall sales increase on a constant currency basis can be attributed in part to a million or increase in core chemistry sales primarily driven by strong dimension product sales globally 
the growth can also be attributed in part to a million or increase in hemostasis product sales and a million or increase in microbiology sales  with the strongest growth for both product lines in gcm americas locations 
partially offsetting this growth is an million or decrease in sales of mature products other across all segments 
we define mature products as those products and services that we do not consider to be part of our core strategy and  as a result  they are expected to have relatively flat or declining sales over time 
our worldwide installed base of instruments grew to  an increase of during the year ended december  growth in the instrument installed base of a product line contributes to the sales growth of the corresponding reagents  consumables and service 
growth in the installed base of dimension rxl max and dimension xpand plus instruments as well as the bn prospec plasma protein instrument continue to drive much of the reagents  consumables and service sales growth seen in our core chemistry products 
gains in the hemostasis installed base have been driven by strong momentum in placing our ca line of coagulation instruments and our platelet function analyzer pfa 
for microbiology  new installations of our microscan autoscan and walkaway series of instruments continue to provide growth 
beyond the installed base impact  we believe reagents and consumables sales growth has benefited from improved method penetration  which results from utilizing the existing instrument base for additional tests 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december   increased million to million as compared to million in the prior year 
on a constant currency basis  gross profit increased million 
gross profit margin for the year ended december   was as compared to in the corresponding prior year period 
the percentage point margin improvement is attributable to percentage points of favorable foreign currency changes and percentage points of favorable product mix and leveraging our manufacturing operations as volume continues to grow 
marketing and administrative expenses 
marketing and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased million to million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in the prior year 
of the total increase  million resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the remaining million increase was primarily due to investments in current resources and processes to support the higher revenues and costs to build our sales and marketing infrastructure for the dimension vistatm system 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december   totaled million of sales and were higher than the prior year 
the increase in research and development expenses of million over the corresponding prior year period is primarily a result of investments in new product development  such as the dimension vistatm system for the high volume testing segment  and new assays for all product lines 
we anticipate commercialization of the dimension vistatm system in the second half of as with all new products we introduce  the rollout will be controlled 
thus  we expect little to no revenue impact in  with market penetration and revenue increasing over the course of changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on research and development expenses 
income from operations 
income from operations for the year ended december   increased million to million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in income from operations is due primarily to the impacts of improved gross profit  partially offset by increased marketing and administrative expenses and research and development spending 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december   totaled million  a million reduction from the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to lower borrowing levels and lower costs of borrowing  partially offset by higher expense for the amortization of debt issuance costs in compared to during  we entered into a new million  five year revolving credit facility which replaced our previously existing term loan and revolving credit facility and reduced our borrowing costs 
we also redeemed our senior subordinated notes as discussed below  which reduced our interest expense in compared to in conjunction with the repayment of the amounts outstanding under the previous term loan and revolving credit facility  the balance of unamortized debt issuance costs were written off and recorded as interest expense 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded debt issuance cost amortization expenses of million and million  respectively  related to the former credit facility 
loss on redemption purchase of senior subordinated notes 
during the year ended december   we redeemed the million outstanding balance of our senior subordinated notes and paid a premium to bondholders of million  as required by certain provisions of the bond indenture 
the premium was recorded as a loss in the statement of operations 
during the year ended december   we incurred losses of million on the early redemption and purchases of a portion of our senior subordinated notes 
these losses represent the difference between the carrying value of the notes and either the redemption price par plus of the face value for notes purchased with stock option or employee stock purchase plan proceeds  or the market price for open market purchases 
see liquidity and capital resources section below for further discussion 
income taxes 
income tax expense of million  representing an effective rate of  was recorded in the year ended december   as compared to million  representing an effective tax rate of  in the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to an income tax benefit of million recorded in the third quarter of  which is mostly attributable to the reversal of valuation allowances related to pensions and net losses on derivative instruments 
these items were originally recognized as part of comprehensive income subsequent to the application of fresh start reporting in also  for certain non us jurisdictions  a change in judgment regarding permanently reinvested earnings and our ability to utilize foreign tax credits required us to reverse a deferred tax liability related to tax provided on cumulative translation adjustment on the undistributed earnings accumulation in these non us jurisdictions through a further income tax benefit was also recorded as we reversed a million post fresh start deferred tax liability related to taxes provided on undistributed earnings accumulated during in certain non us jurisdictions 
the initial impact of recording this deferred tax liability was recognized as part of income tax expense 
net income 
the net income for the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million or 
the increase in net income is primarily attributable to higher income from operations and lower interest expense  partially offset by losses on the redemption of our senior subordinated notes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for the year ended december   totaled  million as compared to  million in the corresponding prior year period 
sales for each segment were as follows in millions year ended december  change gcm americas gcm international global operations total adjusting for the favorable impact of foreign currency rate changes of million  sales increased million or for the year 
on a constant currency basis  sales increased million or in gcm americas and increased million or across gcm international locations 
on a geographic basis  constant currency sales growth was in the us and across all us locations 
the overall sales increase on a constant currency basis can be attributed in part to a million or increase in core chemistry sales primarily driven by strong dimension product sales globally 
the growth can also be attributed in part to a million or increase in hemostasis product sales  with the strongest growth in gcm americas locations  offset by a million or decrease in sales of mature products other across all segments 
our worldwide installed base of instruments  an important indicator of future growth potential  grew during the year ended december  growth in the installed base of dimension rxl max and dimension xpand instruments as well as the bn prospec plasma protein instrument continue to drive much of the reagents  consumables and service sales growth seen in our core chemistry products 
gains in the hemostasis installed base have been driven by successes in ca  ca  ca  bct  bcs and pfa instrument placements 
for microbiology  new installations of our autoscan and walkaway series of instruments continue to provide growth 
beyond the installed base impact  reagents and consumables sales growth has benefited from improved method penetration  which results from utilizing the existing instrument base for additional tests 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december   increased million to million as compared to million in the corresponding prior year period 
on a constant currency basis  gross profit increased million 
gross profit margin for the year ended december   was as compared to in the corresponding prior year period 
the percentage point margin improvement is attributable to percentage points of favorable foreign currency changes and percentage points of manufacturing cost efficiencies and favorable product mix 
marketing and administrative expenses 
marketing and administrative expenses for the year ended december   increased million to million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in the prior year 
of the total increase  million resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and million was due to incremental costs associated with our compliance efforts surrounding section of the sarbanes oxley act of these costs were partially offset by a reduction in stock based compensation expense of million from to the remaining million increase was due to costs to build our sales and marketing infrastructure for the dimension vista system and investments in current resources and processes to support the higher revenues 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december   totaled million of sales and were higher than the prior year 
on a constant currency basis  research and development expenses increased million or over the corresponding prior year period as we make investments in new product development  such as the high volume dimension vista system and new assays for all product lines 
income from operations 
income from operations for the year ended december   increased million to million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in income from operations is due primarily to the impacts of improved gross profit  partially offset by increased marketing and administrative expenses and research and development spending 
interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december   totaled million  a million reduction from the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to lower borrowing levels and lower costs of borrowing 
partially offsetting the decrease is an increase of in amortization of debt issuance costs 
early repayments on our bank borrowings resulted in million of the increase  with the remainder being primarily attributable to amortization of debt costs paid in the fourth quarter of loss on redemption purchase of senior subordinated notes 
during the year ended december   we incurred losses of million on the early redemption and purchases of our senior subordinated notes 
these losses represent the difference between the carrying value of the notes and either the redemption price par plus of the face value for notes purchased with stock option or employee stock purchase plan proceeds  or the market price for open market purchases 
income taxes 
income tax expense of million  representing an effective rate of  was recorded in the year ended december   as compared to million  representing an effective tax rate of  in the year ended december  the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the changes in certain valuation allowances and the mix in income by jurisdiction 
net income 
the net income for the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million or 
the increase in net income is primarily attributable to higher income from operations and lower interest expense  partially offset by higher income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared to million for the year ended december  an increase in net income was slightly offset by an increase in cash outflows from working capital changes in as compared to changes in accounts receivable negatively impacted cash flows by million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in certain countries where the collection process is lengthy  we utilize factoring facilities under which certain trade accounts receivable are sold on a non recourse basis to financial institutions at face value 
the larger decrease in cash flows from accounts receivable during compared to is primarily a result of less accounts receivable factoring 
on a constant currency basis  our utilization of factoring facilities decreased by million and increased by million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   the amount drawn on our factoring facilities was million 
during the year ended december   changes in inventories positively impacted cash flows by million 
however  as a result of building inventory to support the higher level of revenues  changes in inventories negatively impacted cash flows by million during the year ended december  changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities negatively impacted cash flows by million during as compared to million during this unfavorable change in cash flow from to is due to timing of cash disbursements 
when selling instruments to customers  we may enter into sales type lease transactions 
in  we began selling certain lease receivables to a financial institution  of which a majority of the sales occurred in the second half of the year 
during the years ended december  and  million and million of lease receivables were sold to a financial institution  respectively 
these sales resulted in losses of million and million  respectively 
the losses are included in other expense on the accompanying statement of operations 
at december   the short and long term portions of lease receivables which were not sold that are included in accounts receivable and other assets total million and million  respectively 
at december   the short and long term portions of lease receivables which were not sold that are included in accounts receivable and other assets total million and million  respectively 
we expect the amount of lease receivables we sell in to be lower than as changes in customer contract terms are causing a shift away from sales type leases to operating leases 
this shift to operating leases may result in both lower instrument revenue and decreased cash flow in the short term as revenue will be recognized and cash received over the term of the lease instead of at the inception of the lease 
we made pension plan funding payments in the us of million and million and outside the us of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we are currently estimating funding payments in the us and outside the us to be approximately million and million  respectively 
net cash flow used for investing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and was primarily for capital expenditures 
the increase in capital expenditures was due primarily to an increase in the placement of instruments at customers in exchange for contractual commitments for ongoing reagent revenues 
we expect this trend to continue in financing activities for the year ended december  used net cash of million  versus million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used is primarily due to lower debt repayments after giving consideration to the debt refinancing activities during for the years ended december  and  long term debt repayments net of new borrowings were million and million  respectively 
this decrease is partially offset by repurchases of common stock  dividend payments and fewer proceeds from the exercise of stock options in as compared to we used million of cash to purchase our common stock and paid million in dividends during the year ended december  credit facilities 
on april   we entered into a new five year multi currency revolving credit facility revolving credit facility in the amount of million  which expires on april  based upon current third party debt ratings  the interest rate on us dollar denominated borrowings under the revolving credit facility is libor plus basis points or a base rate as defined in the agreement 
however  million of our borrowings under this facility has been hedged by using interest rate swap agreements 
this has resulted in an effective interest rate of on the hedged portion of our borrowings as of december  we paid a commitment fee of basis points on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility during as of december   we had letters of credit outstanding of million  which reduced the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
this new facility replaced our previously existing term loan and revolving credit facility 
amounts outstanding at april  under the old facility of million were repaid with proceeds from the revolving credit facility 
the unamortized balance of deferred financing fees associated with the old facility was written off in april fees for the new facility of million were capitalized during the second quarter and are being amortized over its five year life 
additionally  proceeds from the revolving credit facility were used to redeem the million outstanding principal balance of the senior subordinated notes  pursuant to the make whole redemption provision of the bond indenture 
we incurred a pre tax expense of million in the second quarter of in connection with the redemption  which represented the premium paid to bondholders 
as of december   certain of our subsidiaries in germany had a revolving credit facility with dresdner bank ag that is renewable annually the dresdner facility 
as a result of dresdner bank s participation in the revolving credit facility effective april  the dresdner facility was amended 
the borrowing capacity was reduced from million to million  which can be utilized in the form of cash  guarantees  or as credit lines for derivatives trading and settlement risks 
additionally  the dresdner facility is no longer secured 
we are required to pay a commitment fee of on the unused portion of the credit line related to cash or guarantees 
borrowings under the dresdner facility are subject to a variable interest rate of the european overnight indexed average plus 
as of december   the interest rate was and million was outstanding 
an additional million was utilized for guarantee purposes  which reduced our available borrowing capacity under this facility 
in addition  some of our subsidiary companies operating outside the us have credit facilities available to meet their liquidity requirements 
as of december   the borrowing capacity under these facilities totaled million 
at december   million in borrowings and million of guarantees were outstanding under these credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements 
equity 
during the second quarter of  our board of directors approved a per common share quarterly cash dividend plan 
dividends of million  representing per share of common stock  were paid during the year ended december  the board of directors also approved a stock repurchase program of up to million shares 
we repurchased  shares of common stock under this program during the year ended december  on july   the board of directors approved a two for one split of our common stock 
on august   each shareholder of record at the close of business august   received an additional share of common stock for each outstanding share owned 
in february  the board of directors increased our quarterly dividend from to per common share and authorized us to purchase an incremental million shares of common stock under the stock repurchase program 
contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by year in millions total after revolving credit facility interest and fees on revolving credit facility non us borrowing arrangements operating leases capital lease obligations purchase obligations pension plan contributions total contractual cash obligations purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable supply agreements with vendors for the purchase of specified levels of goods or services over the respective contract periods 
estimated pension plan contributions for are based on our funding policy as discussed below in critical accounting policies 
we have not determined projected pension contributions for years beyond off balance sheet arrangements except as noted in the table above  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that  in management s view  are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our most critical accounting policies note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  reserves for doubtful accounts  adjustments for write down of inventories to net realizable value  impairment of long lived assets  pension plan assumptions  and tax valuation allowances 
we use a combination of historical results and anticipated future events to estimate and make assumptions relating to our critical accounting policies 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
see also note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we manufacture and market a broad offering of clinical diagnostic products and services which include medical diagnostic instruments  reagents and consumables  and maintenance services 
revenue related to the sale of instruments  reagents and consumables represents the vast majority of our sales 
we recognize revenue from the sale of instruments  reagents and consumables upon delivery 
revenue for maintenance services is recognized as the services are provided 
instruments are sold outright to customers or via sales type lease arrangements 
instruments are also leased to customers pursuant to operating leases 
under operating lease arrangements  the cost of the instruments is carried on our balance sheet and amortized to cost of sales over the useful life of the equipment 
we provide most of our products and services as part of bundled contract arrangements  which contain multiple deliverable elements 
revenues under these bundled arrangements are allocated among the contract s constituent elements principally instruments  reagents  consumables and service based upon the estimated fair value of each element as determined by reference to verifiable objective evidence 
our principal point of reference in making this determination is the amount of revenue realized when products and services are sold separately in stand alone transactions 
reserves for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and payment accommodations made to our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and financial health of specific customers 
adjustments for write down of inventories to net realizable value 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost based on the first in  first out method or market 
market for raw materials is based on replacement costs and  for other inventory classifications  on net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for deterioration  excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next months 
several factors may influence the realizability of our inventories  including technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we will be required to recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated change in demand or technological development could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for indicators of impairment 
management s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on operational performance and market conditions 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  including our tradename  are tested for impairment annually 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  market values and projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
pension plan assumptions 
we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all employees in the united states and a combination of contributory and noncontributory plans in certain non us locations 
benefits under the united states plans are based on a cash balance formula 
our funding policy is to make contributions to the trusts of the plans that meet or exceed the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act of  as amended 
in an attempt to anticipate future events  several statistical and other factors are used in calculating the expense  liability and resulting funding requirements related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions we make about  among other things  the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases and withdrawal and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense we have recorded or may record  and our cash funding requirements 
in determining pension expense for  our assumption for the discount rate for the us plans was 
in determining the december  liabilities and pension expense for the us plans  the discount rate was assumed to be 
the discount rates for the non usplans ranged from to  and are expected to be between and for we generally determine the discount rate assumption by constructing a hypothetical portfolio of investments with maturities that mirror the pension obligation 
for the year ended december   our assumptions for the expected long term rates of return on pension plan assets were for the us plans and for non us plans  respectively 
these rates are not expected to change for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is reviewed at least annually  taking into account our asset allocation  historical returns on the types of assets in the trust and the current economic environment 
based on these factors  we expect the plan assets will earn an average of per year for the us plans and per year for the us plans over the long term 
these and other assumptions impacting pension expense could change in the future based on various factors  including  but not limited to  market conditions  asset allocations  and workforce composition 
for  the net periodic benefit costs for our us and us plans were approximately million and million  respectively 
these amounts are approximately million higher than for the us plans and million lower than for the non us plans 
we expect that the costs will be approximately million and million higher than for the us plans and us plans  respectively 
however  changes in interest rates and market gains or losses could significantly impact post pension expense and funding requirements 
tax valuation allowances 
we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances if we believe more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset is not recoverable 
in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets  we consider all currently available data  our historical us gaap and taxable earnings and losses by jurisdiction  current financial condition  forecast of future us gaap and taxable earnings and losses by jurisdiction and other relevant factors 
the data considered in determining the realizability of the us valuation allowance includes the tax deductions that we have received or will receive related to the stock options granted under the management stock option plan and the incentive compensation plan 
see note  shareholders equity and redeemable preferred stock  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
under the us internal revenue code of  as amended  a company is allowed a deduction on the date of exercise equal to the difference between the fair market value on date of exercise and the exercise price 
due to the significant increase in our share price since the issuance of certain stock options  we have a significant tax deduction for stock options 
however  we expect future taxable income to be sufficient enough to offset the tax deduction on the exercise of certain stock options and to utilize net operating loss nol carryforwards subject to the limitation under internal revenue code section based on the above and other positive evidence  the company has reversed substantially all of its us valuation allowances 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in a jurisdiction  or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our remaining net deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results 
see tax credits and loss carryforwards below and note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussions 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle as well as changes required by accounting pronouncements that do not contain specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
will only impact our consolidated financial statements if we implement accounting changes in the future 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the revised statement requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
generally  the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the instruments issued 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
subsequent to the filing of our form k  the securities and exchange commission delayed the required adoption date of the revised statement until january  we will adopt the revised statement at that time using the modified prospective method of application 
after adoption of sfas r  we currently estimate that we will recognize approximately to million of total expense during from stock option grants made during and an estimate of grants expected to be made in  and other stock based compensation that will be provided 
we have also determined that we will have a sufficient additional paid in capital windfall pool to cover future expense 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify the accounting for abnormal inventory costs 
sfas no 
requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility costs  freight  handling costs and spoilage are to be recognized as current period expenses regardless of whether they meet the so abnormal criterion outlined in accounting research bulletin no 
in addition  the allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory is to be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overhead costs are to be recognized as expenses in the period incurred 
normal capacity is defined as the production expected to be achieved over a number of periods or seasons under normal circumstances  taking into account the loss of capacity resulting from planned maintenance 
sfas no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
tax credits and loss carryforwards realization of cancellation of indebtedness income 
subject to certain exceptions  a debtor generally recognizes an amount of cancellation of debt cod income upon satisfaction of its outstanding indebtedness equal to the excess of the adjusted issue price of the indebtedness satisfied over the sum of the issue price of any new indebtedness issued  the amount of cash paid and the fair market value of any other consideration  including stock of the debtor  given in satisfaction of the indebtedness 
as discussed below  there is a bankruptcy exception to the recognition of cod income which applies to us in connection with the plan of reorganization 
a debtor is not required to include cod income in gross income if the debt discharge occurs in a chapter title case under the united states bankruptcy code 
however  under the us internal revenue code of  as amended the tax code  the debtor must  as of the first day of the next taxable year  reduce its tax attributes in general  first its nol carryovers and then tax credits and capital loss carryovers and then the tax basis of its assets by the amount of cod income excluded from gross income by this exception 
as an exception to the order of tax attribute reduction described above  a taxpayer can elect to reduce its tax basis in its depreciable assets first  then its nol carryovers and then its tax credits and capital loss carryovers 
since the cod income was realized in a chapter title case  we are not required to include the cod income in taxable income  but are required to reduce our us nol carryovers by the amount of the cod income 
our us nol carryover as of december  was million after the amount of cod income realized as a result of the plan of reorganization 
section limitation on nol carryovers and other tax attributes 
as a result of the consummation of the plan of reorganization  we underwent an ownership change within the meaning of section of the tax code 
as a consequence  after the plan of reorganization  we are subject to limitation on the use of any us nol carryover incurred prior to the ownership change 
under special provisions of section of the tax code applicable to companies in bankruptcy  the limitation is equal to the product of the lesser of x the value of the equity of the reorganized debtors immediately after the ownership change and y the value of the consolidated gross assets immediately before such change  with certain adjustments and the long term tax exempt rate in effect for the month of the effective date of the plan of reorganization as published in the internal revenue bulletin of the united states treasury department 
we elected not to apply the general us nol limitation applicable to companies in bankruptcy since application of that rule would result in less favorable treatment than that described above 
if a corporation that undergoes an ownership change has a net unrealized built in loss  subject to certain limitations  any recognized built in loss during the five year period beginning with the date of the ownership change  referred to as the recognition period  is generally treated as a pre change loss and is subject to the section limitation described above 
if the corporation has a net unrealized built in gain  subject to certain limitations  the section limitation for any taxable year within the recognition period will be increased by the recognized built in gain for such taxable year 
a net unrealized built in gain or net unrealized built in loss exists to the extent the fair market value of the corporation s assets is more or less  respectively  than the aggregate adjusted tax basis of its assets immediately before the ownership change  provided the resulting net unrealized built in gain or net unrealized built in loss is greater than the lesser of of the fair market value of the corporation s assets and million 
under current us internal revenue service administrative policy  the amount of the cod income recognized upon an ownership change is treated as an item of income attributable to the pre change period under section h of the tax code and such cod income is added to the gross fair market value of the corporation s assets in determining whether the loss corporation has a net unrealized built in loss 
any unused section limitation in a given year may be carried forward  thereby increasing the section limitation in the subsequent taxable year 
however  if the corporation or consolidated group does not continue its historic business or use a significant portion of its assets in a new business for two years after the ownership change  the section limitation resulting from the ownership change will be zero 
alternative minimum tax 
a corporation must pay an alternative minimum tax amt equal to of its alternative minimum taxable income amti  reduced by certain credits allowable for amt purposes  to the extent that the amt exceeds the tax of the corporation calculated at the normal progressive income tax rates 
in calculating the amti  a corporation s income and losses are subject to various adjustments 
for example  in computing amti  a corporation s nols are adjusted for the adjustments and preferences under the amt sections of the tax code and such resulting nols can be utilized to offset only of the corporation s amti 
however  cod income that is excluded from taxable income under the rules discussed above under realization of cancellation of indebtedness income similarly is excluded from amti 
as a result of limitations on the use of our nols and the reduced annual amount of depreciation used in calculating amti  it is possible that we may be required to pay amt even though we may not otherwise be required to pay regular federal income tax 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  we manage exposures to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates primarily through the use of derivatives 
we do not use financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
the qualitative and quantitative information presented below summarizes our market risks associated with debt obligations and other significant financial instruments outstanding at december  fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices 
the information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes  and to our consolidated financial statements 
no material changes in our market risk have occurred since december  interest rate risk 
we use interest rate swap agreements to effectively limit exposure to interest rate movements within the parameters of our interest rate hedging policy 
these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 and as such  as long as the hedge is effective and the underlying transaction is probable  the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these contracts is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until earnings are affected by the cash flows being hedged 
the fair value of our interest rate derivative agreements is the estimated amount that we would pay or receive to terminate the agreements  assuming prevailing interest rates 
on april   we entered into a new million  multi currency five year revolving credit facility 
this new facility replaced our previously existing term loan and revolving credit facility 
amounts outstanding at april  under the old facility of million were repaid by drawing on the new facility 
additionally  we drew funds under the new facility to redeem the million outstanding of our senior subordinated notes  using the make whole provision under the bond indenture 
at december   million of our revolving credit facility was hedged using interest rate swap agreements  which resulted in an average effective borrowing rate of 
a sensitivity analysis to measure the potential impact that a change in interest rates would have on our net income indicates that a adverse change in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million based on december  debt positions 
the table below provides information as of december  about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including our interest rate swap agreements and long term debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for the interest rate swap agreements  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value long term debt variable rate average interest rate interest rate swaps variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate foreign currency risk 
we use foreign currency forward contracts primarily to hedge foreign currency transactional exposures 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregated notional amount of million 
at december   the fair value of outstanding forward foreign currency exchange contracts was an asset of million 
gains and losses on forward contracts resulting from revaluations are recorded to foreign exchange gain loss and substantially offset the gains and losses on the hedged items in current earnings 
to manage the foreign currency risk on our foreign currency sales outside the united states  in we purchased average rate put options for various currencies with characteristics similar to those of our underlying exposure to manage this foreign currency exposure 
the terminal value of the average rate put options is designated as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and as such  as long as the hedge is effective and the underlying transaction is probable  the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these contracts is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until earnings are affected by the cash flows being hedged 
at december   we held average rate put options with aggregated notional amounts of approximately million 
at december   the fair value of outstanding foreign currency option contracts aggregated a million asset 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative use of financial instruments 
derivative losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive losses are a result of qualifying hedging activity 
a sensitivity analysis to measure the potential impact that a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on the company s net income indicates that a adverse change in currency exchange rates would lead to gains losses of approximately million on foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at december  such gains losses would be substantially offset by losses gains from the revaluation or settlement of the underlying positions hedged
