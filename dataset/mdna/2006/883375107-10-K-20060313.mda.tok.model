theragenics and cp medical are also required to adhere to applicable fda regulations for quality system regulation previously known as good manufacturing practices  including extensive record keeping and periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities 
the company obtained fda k clearance in to market the theraseed device for  in general  the treatment of localized solid tumors 
cp medical has also obtained fda clearance for marketing its products 
new fda approvals would be required for any modifications in the company s products  including its theraseed and i seed devices and wound closure products  or its labeling that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the original product 
the company s manufacturing  distribution and security of radioactive materials are governed by the state of georgia in agreement with the nuclear regulatory commission nrc 
the users of the theraseed device are also required to possess licenses issued either by the states in which they reside or the nrc depending upon the state involved and the production process used 
the company is required under its radioactive materials license to maintain radiation control and radiation safety personnel  procedures  equipment and processes  and to monitor its facilities and its employees and contractors 
the company is also required to provide financial assurance that adequate funding will exist for end of life radiological decommissioning of its cyclotrons and other areas of its property where radioactive materials are handled 
the company s decommissioning obligations will increase if production capacity is expanded 
the company is also subject to federal  state and local environmental regulations ensuring the general protection of the environment 
during  the company became aware of the need for an industrial process waste water permit from the city of buford  georgia 
the company has taken all the required steps to obtain this permit and expects to obtain this permit  but has also requested a determination of non applicability 
the company has been authorized by the city to discharge industrial process waste water to the municipal sewage system while the city considers its final decision 
the company transfers low level radioactive waste to licensed commercial radioactive waste treatment or disposal facilities for incineration or land disposal 
the company provides training and monitoring of its personnel to facilitate the proper handling of all materials 
the us department of energy doe has granted theragenics access to unique doe technology  known as the psp  for use in production of isotopes 
the company is in the process of returning the psp equipment to the doe 
however  us government export control laws and regulations  and classification restrictions  which govern the export of certain products which can be produced in the psp and the disclosure and export of certain technology and capabilities associated with the psp  continue to apply as long as the equipment is in the company s possession 
employees as of december   the company and its subsidiary had full time employees including full time temporary employees and executive personnel

item a 
risk factors the company cautions the reader that the risk factors discussed below may not be exhaustive 
the company operates in a continually changing business environment and new risk factors may emerge from time to time 
the company can not predict such new risk factors  nor can it assess the impact  if any  of such new risk factors on the company s business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement 
risks related to our business there are risks associated with our acquisitions  potential acquisitions and joint ventures 
an important element of our strategy is to seek acquisition prospects and diversification opportunities that we believe will complement or diversify our existing product offerings  augment our market coverage and customer base  enhance our technological capabilities or offer revenue and profit growth opportunities 
we acquired cp medical in may further transactions of this nature could result in potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  use of cash and or the incurring of debt and the assumption of contingent liabilities 
acquisitions entail numerous costs  challenges and risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies  personnel and products and the retention of existing customers and strategic partners  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
other risks include the potential strain on the combined companies financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  greater than anticipated costs and expenses related to integration  and potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired entities 
no assurance can be given as to our ability to successfully integrate the businesses  products  technologies or personnel acquired in past acquisitions or those of other entities that may be acquired in the future or to successfully develop any products or technologies that might be contemplated by any future joint venture or similar arrangement 
a failure to integrate cp medical or to integrate future potential acquisitions could result in our failure to achieve our revenue growth or other objectives associated with acquisitions  or recover costs associated with these acquisitions  which could affect our profitability or cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
we may not realize the benefits of the cp medical acquisition 
the process of continued integration of cp medical may be complex  time consuming and expensive and may disrupt our businesses  and could affect our financial condition  results of operations or future prospects 
the combined company will need to overcome significant challenges in order to realize benefits or synergies from the acquisition 
these challenges include the timely  efficient and successful execution of a number of post acquisition events  including integrating the operations and technologies of the two companies  retaining and assimilating the key personnel of each company  retaining existing customers of both companies and attracting additional customers  retaining strategic partners of each company and attracting new strategic partners  and creating uniform standards  controls  procedures  policies and information systems 
the execution of these post acquisition events will involve considerable risks and may not be successful 
these risks include the potential disruption of the combined companies ongoing businesses and distraction of management  the potential strain on the combined companies financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures  and potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquisition and the combined operations 
the company may not succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the acquisition 
the inability to successfully integrate the operations  technology and personnel of the two companies  or any significant delay in achieving integration  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the cost of the cp medical acquisition could harm our financial results 
theragenics invested approximately million for the acquisition of cp medical 
if the benefits of the acquisition do not exceed the associated costs  including costs related to integrating the two companies and dilution to our stockholders resulting from the issuance of shares in connection with the acquisition  our financial results  including earnings per share  could be materially harmed 
we are dependent on key personnel 
we are highly dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  scientific and technical personnel 
therefore  our future success is dependent on our key employees 
while our former chief financial officer and treasurer and our former general counsel and corporate secretary resigned in  management believes that our business and financial results have not been adversely affected 
however  if the services of our chief executive or other key employees cease to be available  the loss could adversely affect our business and financial results 
we carry key employee insurance for ms 
jacobs in the amount of million 
in addition  we are a party to agreements with our executive officers to help ensure each officer s continual service in the event of a change in control 
our stock price has and may continue to be subject to large fluctuations 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general conditions in the medical device and wound closure industries  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
specific factors applicable to us or broad market fluctuations may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in our stock price and share trading volume in the past and may continue to do so 
we face production risks 
theragenics manufacturing process in the brachytherapy business requires  among other things  the use of cyclotrons  which are used to manufacture pd for our brachytherapy seed products 
cyclotron capacity and performance directly affect the company s ability to achieve and increase sales levels 
due to the intricate nature of cyclotrons and the company s exacting specifications for their performance  planned downtime for maintenance and repair is crucial and unexpected downtime may occur 
unexpected mechanical breakdowns or other production delays could materially adversely affect the company s production capacity and its business  financial condition and results of operations 
subsequent to the restructuring announced on august  see restructuring above  the company operates eight cyclotrons 
management has no plans to purchase additional cyclotrons 
cyclotron operation constitutes only one component of our brachytherapy device manufacturing process 
manufacturing or quality control problems may arise as the company increases production or as additional manufacturing capacity is required in the future 
these factors may have an adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
cp medical procures components from suppliers located locally in the united states  as well as in latin america  europe  and asia 
while we believe there is adequate access to alternative suppliers  any disruption in supply could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to stringent government regulation 
the manufacture and sale of the company s products are subject to stringent government regulation in the united states and other countries 
as of december   theraseed  i seed  and certain cp medical products have k clearance from the food and drug administration the fda for commercial distribution in the united states 
fda and other governmental approvals and clearances are subject to continual review  and later discovery of previously unknown problems could result in restrictions on a product s marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market 
the commercial distribution in the united states of new products developed by the company often will be dependent on obtaining the prior approval or clearance of the fda  which can take many years to obtain and entail significant costs 
no assurances can be made that any such approvals or clearances will be obtained on a timely basis or at all 
in countries in which the company s products are not approved as of december   the use or sale of the company s products will require approvals by government agencies comparable to the fda 
the process of obtaining such approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
there can be no assurance that the necessary approvals for the marketing of the company s products in other markets will be obtained on a timely basis or at all 
the company is also required to comply with applicable fda regulations for quality system regulation qsr  including extensive record keeping  reporting and periodic inspections of its manufacturing facilities 
similar requirements are imposed by governmental agencies in other countries 
a new k clearance is required for any modifications in the theraseed  i seed  or certain cp medical devices or their labeling that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the original products 
under the fda s regulatory scheme  the decision whether to seek k clearance for a modified device is left to the manufacturer in the first instance  and management has thus far determined that no such clearance has been required 
the fda has the right to review and revoke k clearance at any time 
the fda may determine that a pre market approval  whereby the fda conducts a scientific and regulatory review of a class iii medical device for safety and effectiveness  may be required for future products or for future modifications to the theraseed or i seed devices or certain cp medical products 
the theraseed and i seed devices and certain cp medical products have also been approved for marketing throughout the member countries of the european union by obtaining appropriate ce marks 
as a result of receiving ce marks  the company must also comply with the regulations of the competent authorities of the european union for any such devices sold in the member nations of the european union 
the company s manufacturing operations involve the manufacturing and possession of radioactive materials  which are subject to stringent regulation 
the users of the company s brachytherapy seed products are required to possess licenses issued by the states in which they reside or the us nuclear regulatory commission the nrc 
user licenses are also required by some of the foreign jurisdictions in which the company may seek to market its products 
there can be no assurance that current licenses held by the company for its manufacturing operations will remain in force or that additional licenses required for the company s operations will be issued 
there also can be no assurance that the company s customers will receive or retain the radioactive materials licenses required to possess and use theraseed or i seed or that delays in the granting of such licenses will not hinder the company s ability to market its products 
furthermore  regulation of the company s radioactive materials manufacturing processes involves the imposition of financial requirements related to public safety and decommissioning  and there are costs and regulatory uncertainties associated with the disposal of radioactive waste generated by the company s manufacturing operations 
there can be no assurance that the imposition of such requirements and the costs and regulatory restrictions associated with disposal of waste will not  in the future  adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is required under its radioactive materials license to maintain radiation control and radiation safety personnel  procedures  equipment and processes  and to monitor its facilities and its employees and contractors 
the company is also required to provide financial assurance that adequate funding will exist for end of life radiological decommissioning of its cyclotrons and other radioactive areas of its properties that contain radioactive materials 
the company has provided this financial assurance through the issuance of letters of credit 
the company has so far been successful in explaining to the georgia department of natural resources that it will not have to dispose of its cyclotrons  but instead will be able to sell them for re use or use for spare parts if it ceases to operate them 
thus  the company is only required to estimate and provide financial assurance for the end of life remediation and disposal costs associated with ancillary structures  such as plumbing  laboratory equipment and chemical processing facilities 
however  if the georgia department of natural resources was to require that the company include the cost of decommissioning its cyclotrons in its financial assurance demonstration  the amount of money required to be set aside by the company to cover decommissioning costs could dramatically increase 
failure to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals  licenses and permits could significantly delay the company s marketing efforts 
furthermore  changes in existing regulations  or interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new restrictive regulations could adversely affect the company in obtaining  or affect the timing of  future regulatory approvals 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in  among other things  significant fines  suspension of approvals  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions or criminal prosecution and materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face risk related to lack of diversification 
prior to the acquisition of cp medical  virtually all of the company s revenues were generated from the brachytherapy seed market  and the company may continue to be substantially dependent on the brachytherapy market 
as of december   the company is divided into two business segments the brachytherapy seed segment and the cp medical segment 
however  the majority of our revenues may continue to be generated from the brachytherapy seed market  and our lack of diversification should be considered a risk as the company is not able to offset losses from one product line with another 
we are dependent on new technological development 
the company competes in a market characterized by technological innovation  extensive research efforts and significant competition 
new developments in technology may have a material adverse effect on the development or sale of the company s products and may render such products noncompetitive or obsolete 
other companies  many of which have substantially greater capital resources  marketing experience  research and development staffs and facilities than the company  are currently engaged in the development of products and innovative methods for treating cancer that are similar to  or compete with  certain of the company s products and technologies 
significant developments by any of these companies or advances by medical researchers at universities  government research facilities or private research laboratories could eliminate the entire market for any or all of the company s products 
we face significant competition 
all of our products are subject to intense competition 
our brachytherapy seeds compete with prostate cancer treatment methods that are well established in the medical community  including radical prostatectomy see treatment options brachytherapy seed business  and competition brachytherapy seed business in item above 
although favorable clinical results for seeding have been released  more extensive outcome data is available for radical prostatectomy rp  and urologists continue to perform rp with considerable frequency 
our brachytherapy business is also subject to intense competition within the brachytherapy seed market 
cr bard  inc distributes palladium pd seeds manufactured by theragenics  and also manufactures and distributes its own iodine i seeds  nycomed amersham plc  a subsidiary of general electric through its control of oncura and mentor corporation manufacture and sell i brachytherapy seeds and distribute pd seeds produced by other manufacturers  and north american scientific  inc manufactures and sells i and pd brachytherapy seeds 
several additional companies currently manufacture and sell brachytherapy seeds as well 
mentor has announced that its urology division  which includes its brachytherapy business  is for sale  though no purchaser has been publicly identified as of the current date 
management believes that theragenics has competitive advantages over these companies including  but not limited to i its proprietary production processes that have been developed and patented  ii its year history of manufacturing radioactive medical devices and its record of reliability and safety in its manufacturing operations  iii vertical integration of production and related services  iv the time and resources required for competitors production capabilities to ramp up to commercial production on a scale comparable to theragenics  v outsourcing of the company s cancer information center to healthcare specialist  telerx  a subsidiary of merck pharmaceutical vi its direct sales force  and the non exclusive distribution agreement that the company currently has in place 
through cp medical  we also compete with other suppliers of sutures  cardiac pacing cables  brachytherapy needles  sleeves and spacers  and other related medical products 
many of these competitors  including ethicon  inc  a johnson johnson company  and us surgical  a division of tyco healthcare group lp  have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than cp medical 
accordingly  such competitors or future competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than us 
as a result  we may be at a disadvantage when competing with these larger companies 
if cp medical fails to compete effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we are highly dependent on our marketing and advertising specialists and our direct sales organization 
any failure to build and manage our direct sales organization could negatively affect our revenues 
beginning in  the company engaged marketing and advertising specialists with experience in healthcare and direct to consumer marketing  and expects direct to consumer activity to continue during the company also expects to continue other activities in an attempt to support its brand name and increase demand for the brachytherapy seed devices  including direct to consumer television and print advertising  clinical studies aimed at showing the advantages of the theraseed and i seed devices in the treatment of prostate cancer  technical field support to theraseed and i seed customers  and other customer service and patient information activities 
we are highly dependent on our direct sales organization comprised of brachytherapy specialists who promote and support our brachytherapy products 
there is intense competition for skilled sales and marketing employees  particularly for people who have experience in the radiation oncology market 
accordingly  we could find it difficult to hire or retain skilled individuals to sell our products 
any failure to build our direct sales force could adversely affect our growth and our ability to meet our revenue goals 
there can be no assurance that our direct sales and marketing efforts will be successful 
if we are not successful in our direct sales and marketing  our sales revenue and results of operations are likely to be materially adversely affected 
we depend partially on our relationships with distributors and other industry participants to market theraseed and i seed and certain of our cp medical products  and if these relationships are discontinued or if we are unable to develop new relationships  our revenues could decline 
we rely  and will continue to rely  upon collaborative relationships with agents and distributors and other industry participants to maintain theraseed  i seed and certain cp medical products market access to potential customers 
some of the entities with whom we have relationships to help market and distribute our products also produce or distribute products that directly compete with theraseed  i seed and certain cp medical products 
in particular  cr bard  one of our primary competitors in the brachytherapy seed business  is also a distributor of our theraseed product 
sales to bard represented of brachytherapy product revenue in the terms of our distribution agreement with bard provides for automatic one year extensions of the term  unless either party gives notice of its intent not to renew at least twelve months prior to the end of the current term 
the current term expires on december   and will be automatically extended for one additional year unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend by december  we cannot assure you that this distribution agreement will be extended and if it is not  how much unit volume being sold through bard will be able to be retained 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or develop these relationships with agents and distributors and other industry participants or that these relationships will continue to be successful 
if any of these relationships is terminated  not renewed or otherwise unsuccessful  or if we are unable to develop additional relationships  our product sales could decline  and our ability to grow our product lines could be adversely affected 
doctors and hospitals may not adopt our products and technologies at levels sufficient to sustain our business or to achieve our desired growth rate 
to date  we have attained only limited penetration of the total potential worldwide market for prostate cancer treatment  innovative sutures  cardiac pacing cables and brachytherapy needles sleeves spacers 
our future growth and success depends upon creating broad awareness and acceptance of our products by doctors  hospitals and freestanding clinics  as well as patients 
this will require substantial marketing and educational efforts  which will be costly and may not be successful 
the target customers for our products may not adopt these technologies or may adopt them at a rate that is slower than desired 
in addition  potential customers who decide to utilize any of our devices  may later choose to purchase competitors products 
important factors that will affect our ability to attain broad market acceptance of our products include doctor and patient awareness and acceptance of our products  the real or perceived effectiveness and safety of our products  the relationship between the cost of our products and the real or perceived medical benefits of our products  the relationship between the cost of our products and the financial benefits to our customers using our products  which will be greatly affected by the coverage of  and reimbursement for  our products by governmental and private third party payors  and market perception of our ability to continue to grow our business and develop enhanced products 
failure of our products to gain broad market acceptance could cause our revenues to decline and our business to suffer 
evolving regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and continuing uncertainty 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nyse rules are creating uncertainty for public companies 
we continually evaluate and monitor developments with respect to new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity  and as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies 
this could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we have invested resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business  financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected 
there are limitations on our ability to protect our intellectual property and we are dependent on trade secrets 
the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to obtain  assert and defend patent rights  protect trade secrets and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others 
the company holds rights to issued united states and foreign patents 
the company also holds a worldwide exclusive license for the use of technology required for producing the therasphere device 
theragenics holds the rights to all improvements developed on this technology 
the company  in turn  sublicenses exclusive worldwide rights to this technology and all improvements 
the company holds an exclusive license to patents for technology concerning methods for delivery of the therasphere device in several countries  and has an exclusive license to some additional patent applications on file in other countries 
there can be no assurance that rights under patents held by or licensed to the company will provide it with competitive advantages or that others will not independently develop similar products or design around or infringe the patents or other proprietary rights owned by or licensed to the company 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any patent obtained or licensed by the company will be held to be valid and enforceable if challenged by another party 
there can be no assurance that patents have not been issued or will not be issued in the future that conflict with the company s patent rights or prevent the company from marketing its products 
such conflicts could result in a rejection of the company s or its licensors patent applications or the invalidation of patents  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of such conflicts  or in the event the company believes that competitive products infringe patents to which the company holds rights  the company may pursue patent infringement litigation or interference proceedings against  or may be required to defend against litigation or proceedings involving  holders of such conflicting patents or competing products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in any such litigation or proceeding  and the results and cost of such litigation or proceeding may materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if patents that contain dominating or conflicting claims have been or are subsequently issued to others and such claims are ultimately determined to be valid  the company may be required to obtain licenses under patents or other proprietary rights of others 
no assurance can be given that any licenses required under any such patents or proprietary rights would be made available on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
if the company does not obtain such licenses  it could encounter delays or could find that the development  manufacture or sale of products requiring such licenses is foreclosed 
the company relies to a significant degree on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological advances that are either not patentable or that the company chooses not to patent 
the company seeks to protect non patented proprietary information  in part  by confidentiality agreements with suppliers  employees and consultants 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that the company would have adequate remedies for any breach  or that the company s trade secrets and proprietary know how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others 
the disclosure to third parties of proprietary non patented information could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on medicare reimbursement policies 
a substantial percentage of the patients treated for prostate cancer in the united states are covered by medicare  and consequently  the costs for prostate cancer treatment are subject to medicare s prescribed rates of reimbursement 
the utilization of theraseed  i seed and many of the cp medical products may be influenced by medicare s reimbursement levels  which can change periodically 
on december   the president signed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of mma into law that provides for improved reimbursement and coding policies in and beyond for brachytherapy seeds sources under medicare s hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps 
the brachytherapy provisions in the mma  which went into effect on january   require medicare to unbundle the cost of the brachytherapy seeds sources from the costs of the brachytherapy procedure  catheters and needles under the opps 
more specifically  the mma requires medicare to reimburse hospitals for each brachytherapy seed source furnished between january  to december  based on the hospital s costs for each patient calculated from the hospital s charges adjusted by the hospital s specific cost to charge ratio 
this means that hospital reimbursement is no longer limited to or dictated by the bundled reimbursement amounts assigned to the brachytherapy codes that the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms used in the mma also directs the us government accountability office gao  formerly the general accounting office to conduct a study examining future payment policies for brachytherapy seeds 
the gao study is still pending 
on november   cms published its final rule on the opps for calendar year there are no changes in the reimbursement policy for brachytherapy seeds sources for  although there are some reductions for hospital payments for procedures required to implant brachytherapy seeds 
additionally  the gao study referred to above may have an effect on the reimbursement level for seeds beginning january  any new reimbursement policies may have an adverse effect on utilization of the company s brachytherapy products 
the company believes its previous efforts in assisting policymakers in formulating and revising medicare policies to recognize the unique aspects of classification and reimbursement that apply to brachytherapy devices such as theraseed were pivotal to the enactment of the improved medicare legislation for brachytherapy seeds sources 
the company plans to continue working to assist policymakers regarding these important issues in the future 
due to the fact that the medicare rules governing coding of brachytherapy seeds sources and the procedures required to implant seeds have undergone significant change during the past few years  and are likely to continue to undergo additional changes  the company believes that medicare reimbursement may continue to create confusion for hospitals and doctors going forward 
medicare s opps reimbursement levels for the procedures performed during prostate brachytherapy could influence the utilization of brachytherapy seeds  including the company s brachytherapy products 
there can be no assurance that i current or future limitations or requirements for reimbursement by medicare or other third party payors for prostate cancer treatment will not materially adversely affect the market for theraseed  or any of our other products  ii that health administration authorities outside of the united states will provide reimbursement at acceptable levels  if at all or iii that any such reimbursement will be continued at rates that will enable the company to maintain prices at levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return 
we may be unable to maintain sufficient liability insurance 
the company s business is subject to product liability risks inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of medical devices 
the company maintains a product liability insurance policy and a general liability insurance policy  each with coverage of an annual aggregate maximum amount of million 
the company also maintains umbrella liability policies with limits of million per occurrence in the aggregate 
the company s product liability and general liability policies are provided on a claims made basis and are subject to annual renewal 
there can be no assurance that liability claims will not exceed the scope of coverage or limits of such policies or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if the company does not or cannot maintain sufficient liability insurance  its ability to market its products may be significantly impaired 
in addition  product liability claims  as well as negative publicity arising out of such claims  could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition and results of operations of the company 
if we do not comply with laws and regulations relating to our use of hazardous materials  we may incur substantial liabilities 
we use hazardous materials and chemicals in our manufacturing operations 
we are required to comply with increasingly rigorous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and workplace safety  including requirements governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances and the discharge of materials into the environment generally 
during  the company became aware of the need for an industrial process water permit from the city of buford  georgia 
the company has taken all the required steps to obtain this permit and expects to obtain this permit  but has also requested a determination of non applicability 
in addition  the company has been authorized by the city to discharge industrial process water to the municipal sewage system while the city considers its final decision 
although  we believe that we handle  store and dispose of these materials in a manner that complies with state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury exists 
in the event of an accident  we could be held liable for decontamination costs  other clean up costs and related damages or liabilities 
to help minimize these risks  we employ a full time environmental health and safety officer and  when appropriate  we utilize outside professional services organizations to help us evaluate environmental regulations and monitor our compliance with such regulations 
litigation may harm our business or otherwise distract our management 
substantial  complex or extended litigation could cause us to incur large expenditures and distract our management  and could result in significant monetary or equitable judgments against us 
for example  lawsuits by employees  patients  customers  licensors  licensees  suppliers  business partners  distributors  stockholders  or competitors could be very costly and could substantially disrupt our business 
disputes from time to time with such companies or individuals are not uncommon  and we cannot assure that we will always be able to resolve such disputes out of court or on terms favorable to us 
defects in  or misuse of  our products  or any detrimental side effects that result from the use of our products  could result in serious injury or death and could require costly recalls or subject us to costly and time consuming product liability claims 
this could harm future sales and require us to pay substantial damages 
because both theraseed and i seed deliver a highly concentrated and confined dose of radiation directly to the prostate  healthy surrounding tissues and organs are typically spared excessive radiation exposure 
this typically results in fewer and less severe side effects and complications than may be incurred with other conventional prostate cancer therapies 
it is an inherent risk of this industry that we might be sued in a situation where one of our products results in  or is alleged to result in  a personal injury 
although we believe that as of december  we have adequate insurance to address anticipated potential liabilities associated with product liability  any unforeseen product liability  exposure in excess of  or outside the scope of  such insurance coverage could adversely affect our operating results 
any such claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in significant damage to our business 
the fda s medical device reporting regulations and the european union viligence reporting regulations require us to report any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or in which our products malfunctioned in a way that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction occurred 
any required filing could result in an investigation of our products and possibly subsequent regulatory action against us if it is found that one of our products caused the death or serious injury of a patient 
because of the nature of our products  the tolerance for error in the design  manufacture or use of our products may be small or nonexistent 
if a product designed or manufactured by us is defective  whether due to design or manufacturing defects  or improper assembly  use or servicing of the product or other reasons  the product may need to be recalled  possibly at our expense 
furthermore  the adverse effect of a product recall might not be limited to the cost of the recall 
for example  a product recall could cause applicable regulatory authorities to investigate us as well as cause our customers to review and potentially terminate their relationships with us 
recalls  especially if accompanied by unfavorable publicity or termination of customer contracts  could cause us to suffer substantial costs  lost revenues and a loss of reputation  each of which could harm our business 
products as complex as our planning and dose calculation software systems may also contain undetected software errors or defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
our products may not be free from errors or defects even after they have been tested  which could result in the rejection of our products by our customers and damage to our reputation  as well as lost revenue  diverted development resources and increased support costs 
we may also be subject to claims for damages related to any errors in our products 
although a number of the cp medical products are class ii devices subject to certain special controls by the fda  many of the cp medical products are class i devices  meaning that the fda considers these products to present minimal potential for harm to the user 
nonetheless  if there is an error in the design  manufacture or use of any of these products  there remains a risk of recall  rejection of our product by our customers  damage to our reputation  lost revenue  diverted development of resources and increased support costs 
we may also be subject to claims for damages related to any error in such products 
as of december   we maintain product liability insurance  which has deductible amounts and per claim and aggregate limits 
however  we cannot assure you that this insurance will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us or in sufficient amounts if at all  or that it will provide adequate coverage in the event that any product liability is actually incurred 
we may require additional capital in the future and we may be unable to obtain capital on favorable terms or at all 
although we expect our existing capital resources and future operating cash flows to be sufficient for the foreseeable future  operating losses could significantly reduce our remaining cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
furthermore  we may require additional capital for the purchase of complementary businesses  technologies or products 
our capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the time and cost involved in expanding production capacity  the cost involved in protecting our proprietary rights and the time and expense involved in completing product development programs 
we have a credit agreement with a financial institution which expires october  and provides for revolving borrowings of up to million at any time outstanding  including a million sub limit for letters of credit 
the credit agreement is subject to early termination upon the occurrence of certain events of default 
in addition  the lender may decide to not extend this credit agreement at the expiration of the term 
finally  the credit agreement is unsecured and includes a springing lien on substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiary subject to certain limited exceptions in the event certain events of default occur under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains representations and warranties  as well as affirmative  reporting and negative covenants  customary for financings of this type 
in the event the credit agreement terminates early or is not extended  we will not have access to future borrowings in order to fund our capital requirements unless we can find new financing 
no assurances are made regarding whether such refinancing can be arranged 
if we are unable to develop new enhancements and new generations of brachytherapy products and innovative sutures  we may be unable to retain our existing customers or attract new customers 
rapid and significant technological change in products offered as well as enhancements to existing products and surgical techniques coupled with evolving industry standards and new product introductions characterize the market for our brachytherapy products and innovative sutures 
many of our brachytherapy products and sutures are technologically innovative and require significant planning  design  development and testing 
these activities require significant capital commitments and investment 
if we are unable to raise needed capital on favorable terms or at all  we may be unable to maintain our competitive advantage in the marketplace 
new product developments in the healthcare industry are inherently risky and unpredictable 
these risks include failure to prove feasibility  time required from proof of feasibility to routine production  timing and cost of regulatory approvals and clearances  competitors response to new product developments  manufacturing  installation  warranty and maintenance cost overruns  failure to obtain customer acceptance and payment  customer demands for retrofits of both old and new products  and excess inventory caused by phase in of new products and phase out of old products 
the high cost of technological innovation is coupled with rapid and significant change in the regulations governing the products that compete in both the brachytherapy and innovative suture markets  by industry standards that could change on short notice  and by the introduction of new products and technologies that could render existing products and technologies uncompetitive 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully develop new products or enhancements to our existing brachytherapy products and innovative sutures 
without new product introductions  our revenues will likely suffer 
even if customers accept new or enhanced products  the costs associated with making these products available to customers  as well as our ability to obtain capital to finance such costs  could reduce or prevent us from increasing our operating margins 
we may not be successful in implementing our restructuring initiatives 
in august  we began implementing certain restructuring initiatives in connection with our decision to begin focusing on our two main business sectors brachytherapy and the wound closure and other product lines for the surgical markets through our newly acquired subsidiary  cp medical 
the restructuring  including the closure of our psp facility in oak ridge  tennessee and the newton terrace facility in buford georgia  has resulted in i the elimination of positions within the company  ii the discontinuation of the company s radiochemical activities  and iii the discontinuation of research and development activities relating to our plasma separation process technology and the vascular  macular degeneration and breast cancer areas  among other things 
the expected benefits from these initiatives are subject to many estimates and assumptions 
if these assumptions are not realized  or if other unforeseen events occur  the initiatives may not be successful and our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
our restructuring of operations may not achieve the results we intend and may harm our business 
as a result of the restructuring  we have incurred significant restructuring charges and expenses and realized significant pre tax savings associated with the restructuring 
we anticipate that the expected net effect of both restructuring charges and savings on pre tax cash flow in will be a net increase in pre tax cash flow 
however  the implementation of our restructuring initiatives may place a strain on our managerial  operational  financial  employee and other resources 
if we experience difficulties in carrying out the restructuring initiatives we may not achieve the cost savings anticipated and may incur greater expenses than expected

the company also manufactures and distributes i seed  its iodine based prostate cancer treatment device 
theragenics is the world s largest producer of palladium  the radioactive isotope that supplies the therapeutic radiation for its theraseed device 
physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers  primarily located in the united states  utilize the theraseed device 
the theraseed device has also been approved for marketing throughout the member countries of the european union by obtaining its ce mark  though sales in europe have not been significant 
the majority of sales are channeled through one third party distributor 
the company also sells its theraseed devices directly to physicians 
on may   the company acquired cp medical corporation cp medical for approximately million  including million in cash and  shares of common stock valued at approximately million 
cp medical is a manufacturer and supplier of innovative wound closure and other medical products such as sutures  cardiac pacing cables  and brachytherapy needles  spacers and sleeves 
cp medical s products have applications in urology  veterinary  cardiology  plastic surgery  dental  orthopedics  and other fields 
historically  cp medical has generated the majority of its revenue in the wound closure market  an estimated billion annual market worldwide and an estimated billion annual market in the united states 
during  approximately of cp medical s revenue was generated in the veterinary wound closure market  an estimated million annual market in the united states 
the transaction established a new growth platform for the company within the field of medical devices and also serves to diversify the company s product offerings within its core brachytherapy business 
consolidated results of operations for the year ended december  include the results of cp medical since may   the first date after the closing of the acquisition 
during the third quarter of a plan to restructure the company was implemented 
this plan was announced on august  see restructuring below 
early in the company diversified its product line with the purchase of the us iodine prostate brachytherapy business of bebig isotopen und medizintechnik gmbh bebig 
the purchase gives theragenics exclusive us manufacturing and distribution rights to an fda cleared iodine based medical device i seed for the treatment of prostate cancer 
the company sells the i seed device directly to physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers 
the company believes that the ability to provide both theraseed and i seed devices enhances the company s ability to market to direct customers who seek a single source for both palladium and iodine brachytherapy seeds 
restructuring on august   the company announced a restructuring that resulted in the closure of the plasma separation process psp facility in oak ridge  tennessee  ended the research and development activities related to the vascular  macular degeneration and breast cancer areas  and eliminated production of radiochemical products 
curtailing these activities allowed the company to shrink its asset base by shutting down six cyclotrons and closing the newton terrace facility in buford  georgia  as well as closing its psp facility 
the objective of the restructuring is to sharpen the company s focus on its two main business segments  brachytherapy seeds and cp medical products  as well as provide a more focused platform for continued diversification and expansion through acquisitions or other channels 
as a result  restructuring charges of approximately million were recorded in these restructuring charges were comprised of one time  non cash impairment charges totaling million which were related to the impairment of the psp equipment and facility in oak ridge  tennessee  the newton terrace facility in buford  georgia  and six cyclotrons and related equipment and facilities  other one time  non cash charges of million  including the write off of inventory and other assets  and contract termination costs related to the oak ridge land lease  and million of severance  site exit and disposal  and other costs 
completion of the restructuring will take a period of months  and the company expects to incur additional pre tax restructuring expenses during of approximately million to million 
these future charges are expected to primarily relate to on going site exit and disposal costs 
during the restructuring generated pre tax operating expense savings of approximately million  including cash based savings of approximately million 
beginning in  the restructuring is expected to generate pre tax operating expense savings of approximately million to million annually  including pre tax cash savings of approximately million to million annually 
on a pre tax net cash flow basis  the restructuring is expected to produce a positive pre tax cash flow impact of approximately million to million in the company intends on disposing of the assets idled by the restructuring 
the company does not expect to be able to sell its leasehold interest in the psp equipment because of its highly specialized nature and the classification and export control regulations applicable to this technology 
however  the company is actively marketing its interest in its oak ridge real estate and the intellectual property generated by the curtailed r d programs 
assets held for sale of approximately million are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  consolidated revenue for the year ended december  was million  consisting of sales in the brachytherapy seed segment of million and sales at cp medical of million 
this represents an increase of million  or  over revenue in  and an increase in brachytherapy seed revenue of million  or over the average selling price of the theraseed device during was comparable to the average selling price during management believes that the increases in brachytherapy revenue are a result of the efforts of the company s direct sales force and its direct to consumer advertising programs 
currently  the company has a non exclusive distribution agreement in place with c 
r 
bard bard for the distribution of the theraseed device  which is effective through december  the bard agreement 
the terms of the bard agreement provide for automatic one year extensions of the term  unless either party gives notice of its intent not to renew at least twelve months prior to the end of the current term 
the current term expires on december   and will be automatically extended for one additional year unless either party gives notice of its intent not to extend by december  the company also had a non exclusive distribution agreement in place with medi physics  inc  formerly d b a nycomed amersham and now part of oncura  a company formed by a merger of the brachytherapy business of amersham plc and galil medical ltd 
the oncura agreement 
in december  oncura notified the company that it would not be renewing its distribution agreement effective december  and subsequently  the oncura agreement was terminated effective september  see below 
sales to oncura during the year ended december  declined by compared to the company and oncura had been arbitrating claims arising in connection with the oncura agreement and on april   the arbitration was settled by mutual consent of the parties 
as part of the settlement  each party has dropped the claims it had been arbitrating against the other and the parties agreed to advance the termination of oncura s distribution agreement for theraseed to september  the company s direct sales force and cr bard  its other distributor  have aggressively marketed theraseed to customers of oncura in an effort to retain the business 
subsequent to the termination of the oncura agreement on september   approximately of the theraseed unit volume from former oncura customers has been retained based on comparison to the average weekly volume for sales to such customers for the first ten months of 
while the company believes that a significant portion of the customers previously supplied through oncura will continue to order theraseed  some of these customers may not and accordingly transition issues may affect sales 
to the extent that the company is able to convert customers of oncura to direct customers  margins would be improved on these particular sales 
in addition  management believes that the brachytherapy industry continues to be adversely affected by competition from other therapies  changes and uncertainties regarding medicare reimbursement  declining prices for iodine and palladium seeds  competitors selling tactics and the effects of consolidation in the industry 
at any point in time  theragenics and or its non exclusive distributor may change their respective pricing policies for the theraseed or i seed in the case of theragenics device in order to take advantage of market opportunities or to respond to competitive situations 
responding to market opportunities and competitive situations could have an adverse effect on average selling prices and could have a favorable effect or prevent an unfavorable effect on market share and volumes 
conversely  the company and its non exclusive distributor could individually and independently decide to maintain per unit pricing under certain competitive situations that could adversely affect current or potential market share and volumes 
licensing fees revenue represents licensing payments for the company s therasphere technology 
such licensing fees are not expected to become material in the foreseeable future 
cost of sales was million during  resulting in a gross profit margin of  compared with cost of sales of million and a gross profit margin of during included in cost of sales for the year ended december  was million of cost of sales associated with cp medical 
the decreased gross margin during was due primarily to a decrease of million in the amount of palladium material produced and used to support research and development efforts during compared to the fixed costs associated with the million in palladium charged to r d in remained in cost of sales during additionally  million of production costs were capitalized during associated with the first production of palladium material using the psp technology at the company s oak ridge  tennessee facility 
as a result of the cessation of production of palladium during the fourth quarter of  no oak ridge production costs were capitalized during the gross margin in was positively impacted by approximately million of manufacturing related cost savings resulting from the restructuring  plus the increased revenue during going forward and based on current operations  the company believes that its gross margins will be impacted by unit volumes in the brachytherapy business  due to its high fixed cost component  as well as product mix at cp medical 
given these factors  the composition of cost of sales in the fourth quarter of is more representative of what is expected going forward in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million during  compared to million during  an increase of million 
this increase resulted from approximately million of sg a at cp medical  plus approximately million of severance related expenses not associated with the restructuring 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in advertising 
however  the company expects to continue to invest in its direct sales force and increase direct to consumer advertising activities in research and development r d expense decreased to million during  from million in the company was previously conducting clinical trials related to the use of palladium for the prevention of restenosis the therap trial  and clinical trials related to the use of palladium to treat exudative wet age related macular degeneration the therasight trial 
the decrease in r d expense during was primarily attributable to the completion of the therap trial during the second quarter of and curtailment of the therasight trial 
in connection with the recent restructuring  all activities related to the therap trial have been discontinued  and activities related to the therasight trial have been curtailed 
looking forward  the only activity expected for these programs is the follow up of all patients previously treated in the therasight trial  in accordance with the fda approved protocol for this trial 
the company expects to reach the study endpoint by late other income  comprising interest income and non operating expenses  was million during  compared to million in interest income in was impacted by higher interest rates and improved returns compared to  offset by less invested funds due to cash used in the acquisition of cp medical 
the company s investments consist primarily of short term cash investments and high credit quality corporate and municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
funds available for investment have and will continue to be utilized for the company s current and future expansion programs and strategic opportunities for growth and diversification 
as funds continue to be used for these programs and activities  and as interest rates continue to change  management expects other income to fluctuate accordingly 
the company s effective income tax rate was a benefit of during  compared to a benefit of during primarily as a result of the restructuring charges incurred during the third quarter of  the company has a net deferred tax asset of approximately million at december  the recent history of operating losses incurred by the company has resulted in a valuation allowance recorded for the full amount of the net deferred tax assets  reducing the income tax benefit recognized in the periods 
the company s income tax rate in each period also differed from statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of tax credits related to research activities and tax exempt interest income 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decline in revenue was primarily due to an decrease in unit sales of the theraseed device  partially offset by  of revenue recognized during for ancillary services to one distributor 
i seed unit sales represented approximately of total unit sales in both and the average selling price of the theraseed device was consistent during when compared to the average selling price during revenue from distributors  including the  of revenue generated from ancillary services  decreased approximately during compared to during december  the company was notified by one of its non exclusive distributors  oncura  that it would not be renewing its distribution agreements effective december  sales to oncura during declined by compared to the corresponding period of the company believes that sales through oncura were adversely affected by the distributor s efforts to market prostate cancer treatments other than the theraseed device or brachytherapy 
the company s licensing fees revenue represents licensing payments for the company s therasphere technology 
such licensing fees are not expected to become material in the foreseeable future 
cost of sales was million during compared to million in gross profit was approximately of revenue in  compared to in the increase in gross profit percentage in compared to was largely due to the capitalization of costs associated with the first production of palladium material using the psp technology at the company s oak ridge  tennessee facility 
total production costs capitalized were approximately million during the total cost of the inventory  including the material and production costs capitalized  is million and is included in work in process inventory in the accompanying december  balance sheet 
the company completed psp production of palladium at oak ridge during the fourth quarter of the company sold the excess palladium metal remaining after the production of palladium for approximately  in november  which reduced the carrying value of inventory by this amount 
the gross margin in was also favorably impacted by  of revenue from ancillary services to one distributor during the twelve months ended december  gross margin during was negatively impacted by the considerable fixed cost component of theragenics operations in combination with lower revenue during the twelve months ended december  compared to the corresponding period of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in  compared to  was due primarily to costs incurred to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  an increase in professional fees for assistance in various key strategic initiatives  an increase in marketing and advertising costs and an increase in compensation and related expenses due primarily to the expansion of the direct sales force 
r d expenses increased to million  or of revenue in  from million  or of revenue in the increase in research and development expense during was primarily attributable to an increase in costs to support the company s peripheral vascular and macular degeneration programs and include the cost of palladium produced for use in r d initiatives 
other income  primarily comprising interest income  was million in compared to  in the increase during is primarily the result of better returns on the company s investments as a result of higher interest rates in the company s investments consist primarily of short term cash investments and high credit quality corporate and municipal obligations  in accordance with the company s investment policies 
the company s effective income tax rate was a benefit of during the twelve months ended december  compared to a benefit of during the twelve months ended december  the company s income tax rate in each period differed from statutory rates primarily due to the recognition of tax credits generated by the company s investments in its expansion projects  research activities and tax exempt interest income 
critical accounting policies the financial statements of theragenics corporation are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
the company s estimates can result in differences from the actual useful lives of certain assets 
as of december   the company owned and operated eight cyclotrons  the first of which entered service in each of the company s cyclotrons is depreciated using an estimated year life 
management s estimate of the useful life of these cyclotrons is based on the company s experience to date with these cyclotrons 
based on experience gained relative to the operation  refurbishment  and maintenance of the cyclotrons  management believes there is a substantive basis for the current depreciable lives of the cyclotrons 
management will continue to periodically examine the reasonableness of its estimates used for depreciation 
if the company should determine that the useful life of property  plant or equipment should be shortened or lengthened  depreciation expense would be adjusted accordingly for the remaining useful life lives of the identified asset s 
management assesses the impairment of its depreciable assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
in the event the expected undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the estimation of fair value  whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale  also involves judgment 
during the third quarter of the company recorded impairment charges of approximately million related to the psp facility  the newton terrace facility  six cyclotrons and other related long lived assets 
this impairment charge reflects the excess of these assets carrying value over their fair value as a result of the restructuring actions taken during the third quarter of see restructuring above 
it is possible that management s estimates concerning the realizability of the company s depreciable assets could change in the future 
goodwill 
on may   the company completed the acquisition of cp medical 
a total of approximately million was paid in connection with the acquisition see overview above and the payments were allocated between the fair value of tangible assets acquired  identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed 
the excess of cost over the fair value of acquired net assets in the amount of million is recorded as goodwill 
early in the company entered into an agreement to purchase the brachytherapy business of bebig isotopen und medizintechnik gmbh  a subsidiary company of eckert ziegler ag 
a total of approximately million was paid in connection with the acquisition and the payments were allocated between the fair value of the assets in the amount of million and million to goodwill 
the equipment supports the company s i seed product and became operational during the first quarter of the company has determined that the production line will be amortized over a fifteen year life 
the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized to expense and must be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
if fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not impaired 
if book value exceeds market value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for this step the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment assessment associated with the cp medical acquisition and i seed equipment during the fourth quarter of  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
intangible assets with definite lives are being amortized and this amortization is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with establishing an allowance for the possibility that portions of our accounts receivable balances may become uncollectable 
accounts receivable are reduced by this allowance 
specifically  management analyzes accounts receivable in relation to current economic trends and changes in our customer payment history in establishing this allowance 
the accounts receivable balance  net of the provision for trade accounts receivables allowance of  was approximately million as of december  stock based compensation 
in february the company granted performance restricted stock rights under which the number of shares issuable upon vesting will vary based on certain performance criteria over the vesting period 
each quarter the company will determine the expected number of shares issuable upon vesting  based on the performance metrics as compared to the criteria to date 
to the extent that the performance metric varies significantly from period to period  the company may record additional compensation expense or adjust previously recorded compensation expense to reflect current estimates 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
a full valuation reserve related to a million net deferred tax asset has been provided as of december  in the future  if sufficient evidence of the company s ability to generate adequate future taxable income becomes apparent  the valuation allowance may be required to be reduced  resulting in income tax benefits in the consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for the valuation allowance each reporting period

medicare developments on december   the president signed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of mma into law that provides for improved reimbursement and coding policies in and beyond for brachytherapy seeds sources under medicare s hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps 
the brachytherapy provisions in the mma  which went into effect on january   require medicare to unbundle the cost of the brachytherapy seeds sources from the costs of the brachytherapy procedure  catheters and needles under the opps 
more specifically  the mma requires medicare to reimburse hospitals for each brachytherapy seed source furnished between january  to december  based on the hospital s costs for each patient calculated from the hospital s charges adjusted by the hospital s specific cost to charge ratio 
this means that hospital reimbursement is no longer limited to or dictated by the bundled reimbursement amounts assigned to the brachytherapy codes that the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms used in the mma also directs the us government accountability office gao  formerly the general accounting office to conduct a study examining future payment policies for brachytherapy seeds 
the gao study is still pending 
on november   cms published its final rule on the opps for calendar year there are no changes in the reimbursement policy for brachytherapy seeds sources for  although there are some reductions for hospital payments for procedures required to implant brachytherapy seeds 
additionally  the gao study referred to above may have an effect on the reimbursement level for seeds beginning january  any new reimbursement policies may have an adverse effect on utilization of the company s brachytherapy products 
the company believes its efforts in assisting policymakers in formulating and revising medicare policies to recognize the unique aspects of classification and reimbursement that apply to brachytherapy devices such as theraseed were pivotal to the enactment of the improved medicare legislation for brachytherapy seeds sources 
the company plans to continue working to assist policymakers regarding these important issues in the future 
due to the fact that the medicare rules governing coding of brachytherapy seeds sources and the procedures required to implant seeds have undergone significant change during the past few years  and are likely to continue to undergo additional changes  the company believes that medicare reimbursement may continue to create confusion for hospitals and doctors going forward 
in that regard  management continues to closely monitor any effects of the reimbursement structure on the brachytherapy market as it continues to evaluate pricing  marketing and distribution strategies 
the company continues to engage a consulting firm specializing in reimbursement practices to help communicate brachytherapy reimbursement guidelines to customers 
medicare s opps reimbursement levels for the procedures performed during prostate brachytherapy could influence the utilization of brachytherapy seeds  including the company s brachytherapy products
