item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered  application critical equipment and systems for the energy  industrial  chemical and pharmaceutical markets worldwide 
we attribute our success to our close and continuing interaction with customers  our manufacturing  sourcing and application engineering expertise and our ability to serve customers globally 
our business consists of three market focused segments fluid management  process solutions and romaco 
beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  we reported realigned segments 
the new segment structure is a result of a significant reorganization of management  operations and reporting that occurred during the first quarter of fiscal the fluid management segment is comprised of the r m energy systems  moyno and tarby product lines 
the process solutions segment is comprised of the pfaudler  tycon technoglass  chemineer and edlon product lines 
the romaco segment includes the hapa and laetus prior to their sale and frymakoruma  noack  siebler  macofar  promatic  unipac  ipm  zanchetta and bosspak product lines 
as a result of the segment realignment  the goodwill recorded as of august  was allocated to the aforementioned product lines based on their relative fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the aggregate goodwill for each new segment is the sum of the reallocated goodwill for the product lines comprising the segment 
in addition  during the first quarter and subsequent to the end of the first quarter  discussions about the sale of romaco progressed and provided additional information regarding the fair value of romaco 
after considering the fair value of the romaco segment  management determined there was an indicator of goodwill impairment under the rules of sfas management estimated the fair value of the romaco segment using current prices that the company may receive in the potential disposition of all or parts of romaco 
based on these estimates  management estimated that goodwill in the romaco segment should be written down by million 
this charge was included in our first quarter results 
a formal appraisal was completed in the third quarter to determine the final goodwill write down 
the results of the appraisal determined that goodwill should be written down by an additional million 
this charge was included in our third quarter fiscal results 
unless otherwise noted  the costs mentioned below in this note were included on the other expense line of our consolidated statement of operations in the period indicated 
during fiscal and  we incurred costs related to a restructuring program of our process solutions and romaco segments 
the restructuring plan was initiated to improve the profitability of these segments and included the following plant closures one of two process solutions facilities in italy  a process solutions facility in mexico and a romaco facility in italy 
headcount reductions within the process solutions and romaco segments 
reorganization of romaco s distribution network 
disposition of two romaco hapa and laetus and one process solutions edlon lined pipe and fittings product lines 
sales of excess facilities 
in fiscal  we sold the aforementioned closed italian facilities  sold the inventory and equipment related to our edlon lined pipe and fittings product line  and reduced total headcount by approximately employees 
we recorded restructuring costs in fiscal totaling million in the process solutions segment and million in the romaco segment 
the costs in fiscal included million to write down inventory and million to write off intangibles related to discontinued product lines 
the inventory charge is included in cost of sales 
cash proceeds from the sale of facilities and product lines were million 
the loss recognized in as a result of these asset sales was million 
in fiscal  we sold the hapa and laetus product lines 
in addition  we reorganized romaco s sales distribution network  sold and or exited five romaco and process solutions facilities  that reduced headcount by employees 
we 
table of contents recorded restructuring costs in fiscal totaling million in the process solutions segment and million in the romaco segment 
the costs in fiscal included million to write down inventory related to discontinued product lines 
this charge is included in cost of sales 
offsetting the restructuring costs was a gain on the disposition of the hapa and laetus product lines of romaco of million 
also during the year  we sold the edlon lined pipe and fittings product line facility for million 
the loss on the disposition and other related costs were million 
in the second quarter of fiscal we reached an agreement to sell certain chinese land and buildings  resulting in a million gain before minority interest 
the cash proceeds of million from the sale are expected to be received in fiscal we have moved our production operations to a newly constructed facility 
we have reached an agreement to sell the aforementioned closed mexico facility 
we expect to close this sale  receive million cash proceeds  and record a million pre tax gain in fiscal we expect to incur additional personnel termination and facility closure costs of approximately million to million in fiscal related to the romaco distribution network restructuring 
results of operations the following tables present components of our consolidated statement of operations and segment information

table of contents fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  net sales sales for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
the impact of exchange rates was minimal for the year 
we disposed of several product lines impacting the comparability of our sales 
as of august  the edlon lined pipe and fitting product line of the process solutions segment was sold and as of march  the hapa and laetus product lines of the romaco segment were sold 
these dispositions reduced sales million in fiscal as compared to fiscal continuing business sales increased million or 
the fluid management segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase was driven primarily by strong demand for drilling and exploration equipment  likely resulting from high oil and natural gas prices 
the segment also enjoyed increases in sales for general industrial and chemical processing applications as a result of healthy end market conditions 
the process solutions segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal continuing business sales increased million  or 
chemical processing and pharmaceutical market conditions remained flat for much of the year  however  the company experienced a significant increase in orders during the second half of the year 
the romaco segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal continuing business sales increased million  or 
sales in this segment have stabilized at or near historically low levels 
consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry as well as the introduction of fewer new drug compounds has led to a decline in the investment in new packaging capacity in this sector  which has negatively impacted our sales 
earnings before interest and income taxes ebit the company s operating performance is evaluated using several measures including ebit 
ebit is income before interest and income taxes and is reconciled to net income on our consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate performance of our business segments and allocate resources based on ebit 
ebit is not  however  a measure of performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of our operating results 
ebit is not a measure of cash available for use by management 
consolidated ebit for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  a decline of million 
the decline in ebit was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of million  ebit associated with disposed product lines during the year estimated at approximately million and higher costs related to variable pay  sarbanes oxley compliance and the expensing of stock options under sfas r 
offsetting these ebit declines were lower other costs related to restructuring and facility dispositions of million  the estimated incremental profit from the sales increase of continuing businesses estimated at approximately million and estimated cost savings from restructuring activities of approximately million 
the fluid management segment ebit for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the increase of million resulted from the sales increase of million 
the process solutions segment ebit was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million 
other costs related to restructuring and facility dispositions  discussed above  were million lower in fiscal the remaining improvement in profitability was primarily due to estimated cost savings realized from our restructuring programs and the impact of product mix 
the romaco segment ebit was negative million for fiscal compared to negative million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decline in ebit was primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of million in fiscal and the ebit associated with disposed product lines during the year estimated at approximately million 
offsetting these ebit declines were lower other costs related to restructuring and facility dispositions in fiscal of million 
the remaining improvement is primarily from estimated cost savings from restructuring programs 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash generated from operations  asset product line sales and the conversion of million of our convertible notes into common stock late in the fiscal year all contributed to lower debt levels in fiscal income taxes we had million of income tax expense in spite of a million pretax loss because of two significant transactions with minimal tax impact  the goodwill impairment charge of million and the gain on the sale of hapa and laetus of million 
after considering the impact of these transactions  our effective tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal these high effective tax rates are the result of our inability to record tax benefits on losses incurred in certain non us tax jurisdictions  primarily germany and italy  due to uncertainty over our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions to utilize these benefits 
if our operations in these countries become profitable  our effective tax rate will decrease as we recognize the benefits of loss carryforwards 
the fiscal adjusted rate of is lower than the fiscal rate because of lower losses in germany and italy in fiscal net loss our net loss in fiscal was million compared with a net loss in fiscal of million 
the overall reduction in net income is a result of the higher goodwill impairment and other expenses of million  as discussed above  and higher tax expense 

table of contents fiscal year ended august  compared with fiscal year ended august  net sales sales for the fiscal year ended august  were million compared to million in fiscal the impact of exchange rates  the translation of sales from non us operations into non us dollars  caused an increase in sales of million  resulting in a sales increase of million on a constant dollar basis 
the fluid management segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the impact of exchange rates increased sales by million resulting in an increase of million  or  on a constant dollar basis 
the increase in sales in this segment was driven by the energy market where high prices for oil and natural gas have caused increased investment demand for drilling and exploration equipment 
the process solutions segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the impact of exchange rates increased sales by million resulting in an increase of million on a constant dollar basis 
sales are relatively flat at low historical levels 
the chemical processing market has shown some signs of improvement as capacity utilization in that market is improving  however  consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry and weak economic conditions in europe have caused excess production capacity and limited new capital investment by our customers 
the purchase of capital equipment by these pharmaceutical companies has declined and new projects are being delayed  which has negatively impacted sales of our products 
the romaco segment had sales of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the impact of exchange rates increased sales by million resulting in a decrease of million  or on a constant dollar basis 
consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry as well as the introduction of fewer new drug compounds has led to a decline in the investment in new packaging capacity in this sector  which has negatively impacted our sales in this segment 
earnings before interest and income taxes ebit consolidated ebit for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal included in the fiscal ebit are costs in the process solutions segment for restructuring of million and asset dispositions of million  as well as restructuring costs of million in the romaco segment 
ebit was further impacted by additional costs of approximately million related to the initial documentation and testing requirements of sarbanes oxley section compliance 
these costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the fluid management segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
ebit increased approximately million due to the sales volume increase mentioned above 
offsetting this improvement was higher pension and medical costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal the process solutions segment had ebit of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  a decline of million on consistent constant currency sales 
ebit decreased in this segment in due to restructuring and business disposition costs of million in fiscal that were not in fiscal and costs from underutilization of our production facilities of million 
offsetting these declines were realized cost savings from restructuring programs of million 
the romaco segment had negative ebit of in fiscal compared to positive ebit of million in fiscal  a decline of million 
ebit declined by million due to restructuring costs incurred in fiscal  million from the aforementioned constant dollar decline in sales volume and million from lower selling prices for our products 
offsetting these declines were the realized cost savings from our restructuring programs of million 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal and fiscal we had lower average debt levels in fiscal  but this was offset by slightly higher interest rates during fiscal 
table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate in fiscal was compared with in fiscal the substantial increase in our effective tax rate is a result of our inability to record tax benefits on losses incurred in certain non us tax jurisdictions  primarily germany and italy  due to uncertainty about whether or not we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions to utilize these benefits 
if our operations in these countries become profitable  our effective tax rate will decrease as we recognize the benefits of loss carryforwards 
net loss our net loss in fiscal was million compared with net income in fiscal of million 
the overall reduction in net income is a result of the million of restructuring and other charges related to asset dispositions  reduction in selling prices within our romaco segment  and the higher effective tax rate caused by our inability to record tax benefits on losses incurred in certain non us tax jurisdictions 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities in fiscal  our cash flow from operating activities was million compared with million in fiscal  an increase of million 
this increase resulted primarily from better operating asset efficiency of million and cash generated from other operating activities 
we expect our fiscal operating cash flow to be adequate to fund fiscal year operating needs  scheduled debt service  shareholder dividend requirements and planned capital expenditures 
our planned capital expenditures are related to additional production capacity  new products and services  cost reductions and replacement items 
investing activities our capital expenditures were million in fiscal  down from million in fiscal the capital expenditures increased our capacity and supported new product development activities of our fluid management segment  and replaced equipment at our other business units 
during  we sold the hapa and laetus product lines and two facilities to generate million of cash 
in fiscal we sold three facilities and we sold inventory and equipment related to our edlon lined pipe and fittings product line  which generated total cash proceeds of million 
financing activities we paid million to amend and extend our credit agreement in fiscal dividends paid during fiscal were million 
proceeds from the sale of common stock were million in fiscal and related mostly to the exercise of stock options by current and former employees 
credit agreement our bank credit agreement agreement provides that we may borrow on a revolving credit basis up to a maximum of million 
all outstanding amounts under the agreement are due and payable on november  interest is variable based upon formulas tied to libor or prime  at our option  and is payable at least quarterly 
at august   there were no amounts borrowed under the agreement 
indebtedness under the agreement is secured by accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and fixtures of our us subsidiaries  the pledge of the stock of our us subsidiaries and the pledge of the stock of certain non us subsidiaries 
under this agreement and other lines of credit  we had million of unused borrowing capacity 
however  due to our financial covenants and outstanding standby letters of credit  we could only incur additional indebtedness of million at august  we had million of standby letters of credit outstanding at august  these standby letters of credit are used as security for advance payments received from customers and future payments to our vendors 
the agreement expires on november  and we are actively negotiating an amendment or replacement of the current facility to expand capacity  reduce costs and increase strategic flexibility 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis is based on our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the more critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time of title passage to our customer 
in instances where we have equipment installation obligations  the revenue related to the installation service is deferred until installation is complete 
we recognize revenue for certain longer term contracts based on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method requires estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost applicable to various stages of the contract 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that gave rise to the revision become known 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
significant estimates made by us include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  warranty accruals  litigation  product liability  environmental accruals  goodwill valuation and retirement benefit obligations 
our estimate for uncollectible accounts receivable is based upon an analysis of our prior collection experience  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends within the industries we serve 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us eg  bankruptcy filings or substantial downgrading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
inventory valuation reserves are determined based on our assessment of the market conditions for our products and the on hand quantities of inventory in relation to historical usage 
as of august  we have inventory valuation reserves of million 
the inventory upon which this reserve relates is still on hand and will be sold or disposed of in the future 
the expected selling price of this inventory approximates its net book value  therefore there is no significant impact on gross margin when it is sold 
we have recorded valuation allowances to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized based upon our analysis of estimated future taxable income and establishment of tax strategies 
future taxable income  reversals of temporary differences  available carryback periods  the results of tax strategies and changes in tax laws could impact these estimates 
warranty obligations are contingent upon product failure rates  material required for the repairs and service delivery costs 
we estimate the warranty accrual based on specific product failures that are known to us plus an additional amount based on the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales 
we record litigation  product liability and environmental reserves based upon a case by case analysis of the facts  circumstances and estimated costs 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are subject to change as conditions within and beyond our control change  including but not limited to economic conditions  the availability of additional information and actual experience rates different from those used in our estimates 
accordingly  actual results may differ from these estimates 
goodwill goodwill is tested on an annual basis  or more frequently as impairment indicators arise 
impairment tests  which involve the use of estimates related to the fair market values of the business operations with which goodwill is associated  were performed during fiscal to determine goodwill impairment and at year end our annual impairment test date 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of the businesses for the 
table of contents purposes of our annual or periodic analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of these businesses 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives 
losses  if any  resulting from impairment tests are reflected in operating income in our consolidated statement of operations 
foreign currency accounting gains and losses resulting from the settlement of a transaction in a currency different from that used to record the transaction are charged or credited to net income or loss when incurred 
adjustments resulting from the translation of non us financial statements into non us dollars are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss for all non us units 
we use permanently invested intercompany loans as a source of capital to reduce the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in our foreign subsidiaries 
these loans are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
therefore  we record foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
pensions we maintain defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that provide retirement benefits to substantially all us employees and certain non us employees 
pension expense for fiscal and beyond is dependent on a number of factors including returns on plan assets and changes in the plan s discount rate and therefore  cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
the following paragraphs discuss the significant factors that affect the amount of recorded pension expense 
a significant factor in determining the amount of expense recorded for a funded pension plan is the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we develop the long term rate of return assumption based on the current mix of equity and debt securities included in the plan s assets and on the historical returns on those types of investments  judgmentally adjusted to reflect current expectations of future returns 
in addition to the expected rate of return on plan assets  recorded pension expense includes the effects of service cost the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period and interest on the plan s liabilities to participants 
these amounts are determined actuarially based on current discount rates and assumptions regarding matters such as future salary increases and mortality 
differences in actual experience in relation to these assumptions are generally not recognized immediately but rather are deferred together with asset related gains or losses 
when cumulative asset related and liability related gains or losses exceed the greater of of total liabilities or the calculated value of plan assets  the excess is amortized and included in pension income or expense 
at august   the discount rate used to value the liabilities of the principal us plan was 
we determine our discount rate based on an actuarial yield curve applied to the payments we expect to make out of our retirement plans 
additional changes in the key assumptions discussed above would affect the amount of pension expense currently expected to be recorded for years subsequent to specifically  a one half percent decrease in the rate of return on assets assumption would have the effect of increasing pension expense by approximately million 
a comparable increase in this assumption would have the opposite effect 
in addition  a one half percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase expense by approximately million 
new accounting pronouncement in july the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
fin is effective as of the beginning of fiscal years that start after december  we have not yet determined the effect on the company s financial position or results of operations of complying with the provisions of fin 
table of contents in september the financial accounting standards board issued fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas no 

sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
an employer is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures of sfas no 
as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  we have not yet determined the effect on the company s financial position from complying with the provisions of sfas no 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain operations in the us and foreign countries 
we have market risk exposure to foreign exchange rates in the normal course of our business operations 
our significant non us operations have their local currencies as their functional currency and primarily buy and sell using that same currency 
we manage our exposure to net assets and cash flows in currencies other than us dollars by minimizing our us dollar net asset positions 
we also enter into hedging transactions  primarily currency swaps  under established policies and guidelines that enable us to mitigate the potential adverse impact of foreign exchange rate risk 
we do not engage in trading or other speculative activities with these transactions as established policies require that these hedging transactions relate to specific currency exposures 
our main foreign exchange rate exposures relate to assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in british pounds  euros  swiss francs and canadian dollars and the general economic exposure that fluctuations in these currencies could have on the us dollar value of future us cash flows 
to illustrate the potential impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on us for fiscal  the net unhedged exposures in each currency were remeasured assuming a decrease in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar 
using this method  our ebit for fiscal would have increased by million and our cash flow from operations for fiscal would have decreased by million 
this calculation assumed that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes may also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not include any effects of potential changes in sales levels or local currency prices 
we also have market risk exposure to interest rates 
at august   we had million in interest bearing debt obligations subject to market risk exposure due to changes in interest rates 
to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates  we attempt to maintain a balance between fixed and variable rate debt 
we expect this balance in the debt profile to moderate our financing cost over time 
we are limited in our ability to refinance our fixed rate debt 
however  we have the ability to change the characteristics of our fixed rate debt to variable rate debt through interest rate swaps to achieve our objective of balance 
we have an interest rate swap agreement that effectively modifies a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
this agreement involves the receipt of fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of underlying principal amounts 
the mark to market values of both the fair value hedging instrument and the underlying debt obligation were equal and recorded as offsetting gains and losses in current period earnings 
the fair value hedge qualifies for treatment under the short cut method of measuring effectiveness 
as a result  there was no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness 
the interest rate swap agreement totals million  expires in and allows us to receive an effective interest rate of and pay an interest rate based on libor 
at august   million of our outstanding debt was at fixed rates with a weighted average interest rate of and million was at variable rates with a weighted average interest rate of 
the estimated fair value of our debt at august  was approximately million
