risk factors beginning on page of this report 
executive overview schlumberger consists of two business segments oilfield services and westerngeco 
oilfield services experienced strong growth in with a sharp rise in operating margins due to increasing activity  strong pricing momentum and accelerated technology introduction 
oil prices ended the year higher than at the beginning of the year  while natural gas prices surged over the same period 
in the united states  the absence of a meaningful increase in natural gas production supported strong natural gas prices in  which averaged more than per mmbtu in additionally  the devastating hurricane season resulted in a severe disruption of the already stretched united states oil industry 
eastern hemisphere activity grew significantly but is still at a fairly early stage with the supply response only now translating into increased exploration  development and production maintenance operations in key international areas such as russia and the middle east 
internationally  projects ramped up throughout the year  supporting a steady growth in growing levels of activity and increasing preparations for new projects in the eastern hemisphere indicate a trend that is expected to continue in westerngeco delivered excellent results 
demand for seismic acquisition  principally marine  as well as multiclient data indicate a strong renewed interest in exploration 
the continued acceptance of q technology resulted in impressive growth  which is expected to continue in in russia  the cooperation and confidence established during the initial period of our minority holding of petroalliance services company limited  russia s largest independent oilfield services company  has confirmed our belief that the company will play a major role in our continued expansion 
schlumberger acquired an additional equity stake in petroalliance in  bringing schlumberger s total ownership to 
schlumberger initially acquired in the second quarter of the acquisition of the remaining of the company is expected to be completed in  subject to performance requirements  regulatory approval  and other customary provisions 
recent seismic  logging and well testing contracts show a renewed interest in exploration in both new and existing areas 
this shift  together with increasing customer spending  tightening service industry resources  and faster deployment of new technologies creates an environment in which schlumberger is well positioned 
ongoing supply constraints and resilient demand growth support high energy prices with opec giving the market strong signals that it considers the to range per barrel for wti west texas intermediate to be appropriate 
limited spare production capacity combined with geopolitical tensions that threaten supply availability provide upside potential for oil prices 
supply problems may prove even more severe for natural gas as accelerated production decline rates  and limited ability to increase drilling activity  continue to challenge united states and canadian gas producers 
iea international energy agency projections show oil demand growth continuing at an annual rate of about million barrels per day to million barrels per day through to to reach a total of approximately million barrels per day 
this represents an increase of nearly million barrels per day over demand in the iea also show supply capacity growth just matching demand growth in  and  with capacity growth managing to increase slightly faster than demand in and in short  based on the iea numbers  the degree of spare upstream capacity is not expected to increase significantly before the end of the decade 

table of contents part ii  item several trends will define activity in first  rig count increases will be largely limited to onshore work as the global offshore rig market will remain constrained until new builds are mobilized beyond second  shortages of people and equipment across the industry are likely to result in cost inflation and project delays  placing a high premium on reliable suppliers of both technology and skilled personnel 
third  the technology that can improve the productivity of the limited base of skilled personnel will be in high demand 
this is clearly demonstrated both by the success of schlumberger petrel seismic to simulation software tools  and by growing acceptance of the remote monitoring of job execution to achieve superior performance from technology 
fourth  exploration activity  where schlumberger has an unmatched portfolio of services  is expected to show a large increase in and to continue for a number of years 
the industry has already recognized the need for an unprecedented effort to increase secure hydrocarbon supply 
plans are being put in place to achieve this  but it will take several years of sustained activity to develop the new production that can reliably replace today s supply  much of which was developed during the up cycle of the s and s 
in addition  this new supply will generally come from smaller reservoirs and more hostile environments where schlumberger is uniquely placed to meet the challenge 
the following discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements 
stated in millions change change oilfield services operating revenue pretax segment income westerngeco operating revenue pretax segment income pretax segment income represents the business segments income before taxes and minority interest 
pretax segment income excludes corporate expenses  interest income  interest expense  amortization of certain intangibles  interest on post retirement benefits  stock based compensation costs and the charges and credits described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  as these items are not allocated to the segments 
oilfield services results revenue of billion increased in versus both latin america and europe cis africa increased  middle east asia increased and north america increased 
the strong activity levels around the world reflected the growing response to the current narrow margin of excess production capacity 
pretax operating income of billion in was higher than in demonstrating high demand for oilfield services and accelerating technology delivery 
both higher activity and stronger pricing contributed to the sharp increase in pretax operating margins that strengthened across all oilfield services geographical areas 
pricing showed strong improvement in north america and continued to make excellent progress internationally 
customer concern over the availability of certain services and products coupled with recognition of elements of cost inflation has led to inclusion of price escalation clauses in longer term contracts 
activity increased universally  with the largest growth recorded in the geomarkets in canada  us land  peru colombia ecuador  russia  nigeria  australasia  saudi arabia  and the arabian gulf 
both organic growth and acquisitions contributed to the more than revenue growth in russia in versus 
table of contents part ii  item demand for all technologies increased sharply  but particularly for well services and well completions productivity services 
technology introduction accelerated during the year 
the scope family of drilling measurements services for improved drilling performance and enhanced formation evaluation  met growing acceptance as customers realized step changes in well placement accuracy in several geographical areas 
during the year schlumberger also launched the scanner family of wireline logging services  a revolutionary suite of downhole rock and fluid characterization measurements 
north america revenue of billion increased over mainly driven by canada and us land  which benefited from strong well services and drilling measurements activity coupled with strong pricing improvements 
the canada geomarket experienced strong equipment and personnel utilization  higher pricing and increased demand for high tier services 
the robust growth in us land resulted from the combination of positive trends in activity and favorable pricing 
during the third quarter  activity was severely disrupted in the gulf of mexico with more than days of operating time lost due to the disastrous hurricane season 
damage sustained by production platforms and mobile offshore drilling units led to reduced activity throughout the third quarter with some lingering effect in the fourth quarter 
pretax operating income of million was higher than in led by us land and canada 
the steep growth was primarily due to double digit price increases  particularly for well services  wireline and drilling measurements technologies 
new technology introduction and continuing activity growth also contributed to these results 
the severe hurricane season in the gulf of mexico had an estimated impact of approximately million in lost revenue  and million in lost pretax operating income 
latin america revenue of billion in increased over with the highest growth recorded in the peru colombia ecuador and latin america south geomarkets 
mexico recorded significant revenue growth  mainly due to a high number of wells being completed on the burgos project  coupled with an overall rise in third party managed services revenue 
activity in venezuela increased primarily from ipm and well services operations 
during the year  continued progress was highlighted with the signing of a short term renewable agreement with pdvsa in early for operations on the prisa project 
discussions regarding the settlement of certain outstanding receivables were still on going at year end 
the peru colombia ecuador geomarket contributed significantly to the revenue growth due to the start of several new drilling measurements contracts for the expanding customer base 
the growth in the latin america south geomarket was primarily driven by increased ipm activity  although brazil experienced strong activity from the deployment of drilling measurements and wireline technologies 
pretax operating income of million in increased versus this strong increase in operating income resulted mainly from an improved drilling environment in venezuela coupled with stronger operating efficiencies in well services and drilling measurements services and across all geomarkets  particularly in the peru colombia ecuador geomarket 
europe cis africa revenue of billion in increased over with the highest growth recorded in the russia and nigeria geomarkets 

table of contents part ii  item strong revenue increases were recorded offshore nigeria and in deepwater west africa geomarket operations mainly benefiting well completions productivity  wireline  and drilling measurements with the rapid market acceptance of scope technology 
the cis reached a new revenue record at billion  an increase of over the significant increase in revenue in russia was due to a combination of organic growth  and the impact of the acquisitions of petroalliance and the siberian geophysical company 
organic growth in russia was driven by a recovery in activity for yuganskneftegaz during the first quarter  increased demand for stimulation and cementing services  strengthening of ipm operations  and robust uptake of new technology 
pretax operating income of million in increased compared to nigeria and west africa contributed significantly due to increased activity  pricing improvements  and accelerated technology deployment 
operating income in the north africa geomarket also increased markedly due to the growing presence of international oil companies in the region 
the north sea geomarket was a strong contributor to operating income through increased drilling activity and strong demand for production technologies from well services and wireline 
middle east asia revenue of billion in increased over with the highest growth recorded in the australasia  brunei malaysia philippines  saudi arabia and gulf geomarkets 
the importance of the middle east in responding to the current lack of spare production capacity is reflected in the strong activity plans that were implemented in the region in the marked revenue growth seen in the saudi arabia geomarket was principally due to the increase in rig count as saudi aramco continued to increase activity in line with their announced spending plans 
east africa east mediterranean geomarket growth was mainly due to the expanded market for drilling measurements and the start of a new wireline campaign 
in the gulf geomarket  the start up of wireline services for petroleum development oman pdo and burgeoning gas activity in qatar also contributed to the revenue growth 
the arabian  the gulf and east africa east mediterranean geomarkets recorded revenue increases of more than and operating income growth of more than 
the solid contribution from the brunei malaysia philippines geomarket was mainly due to higher customer expenditures  improved pricing  and a move by several operators into increased deepwater exploration uniquely benefiting schlumberger technologies 
activity in china strengthened throughout the year as a result of accelerated adoption of advanced drilling measurements and wireline technologies 
australasia experienced a robust revenue growth rate mainly due to rising development activity in offshore australia combined with growing land based activity in new zealand 
pretax operating income of million in increased compared to the steady increase in operating income and operating margins throughout the year was due to activity improvement across all geomarkets and significant price increases principally in drilling measurements  well completions productivity  and wireline technologies coupled with the start up of new projects throughout the area 
improved results of the bokor integrated project in the brunei malaysia philippines geomarket also contributed to the operating income growth 
results revenue of billion increased in versus north america increased  middle east asia increased  and latin america increased 
europe cis africa was up by 
pretax operating income of billion in was higher than in 
table of contents part ii  item activity increased in almost all regions with the largest growth recorded in the geomarkets in india  mexico  russia  east africa and the eastern mediterranean  and the caspian 
russia continued to make impressive progress with growth exceeding our expectations despite the absence of any activity for yuganskneftegaz at the end of the year 
demand for all technologies increased  particularly for drilling measurements technologies including the powerdrive and newly introduced powerv rotary steerable systems as well as wireline abc analysis behind casing and pressurexpress services 
increased demand for well services production technologies also contributed significantly to the growth 
these technologies included the successful launch of the powerclean system  an integrated solution for optimizing production through wellbore fill removal using coiled tubing 
well completions productivity technologies also showed strong growth for production based technology services  while ipm activity continued its expansion 
the rate of new technology introductions is expected to accelerate over the coming two year period 
offshore and deepwater activity in india utilizing wireline  drilling measurements and well completions productivity technologies continued to drive significant year on year growth 
growth in india was supported by the award of a completion sales tender for subsurface safety valves and a three year contract for wireline logging on onshore fields for ongc valued at more than million 
during the year schlumberger opened a technology hub on the campus of the gubkin russian state university of oil and gas  russia s leading oil and gas educational establishment 
the hub complements other schlumberger research and engineering activities in russia 
shell international exploration and production bv and schlumberger information solutions formed an alliance for the research and development of next generation smart fields hydrocarbon development solutions 
north america revenue of billion increased over led principally by canada and us land  which benefited from the strong performance of most technologies  coupled with pricing improvements particularly for well services 
growth in canada was due to increased activity and substantially higher pricing 
us land delivered robust revenue growth primarily due to continued favorable oil and gas industry dynamics  the expansion of the unconventional gas market  an improved pricing environment as a result of tighter resource availability  and strong overall market demand combined with increasing demand for abc technologies  and drilling measurements powerdrive rotary steerable systems 
these technology advances are demonstrating value and are helping drive activity while enabling price increases and efficiency gains 
pretax operating income of million was higher than in due mainly to increased operating leverage in us land  with double digit price improvements in well services and wireline technologies over averages 
in canada  increased activity coupled with sustained pricing improvements  and the favorable exchange rate effect led to a notable improvement in operating income 
at the end of the year  the technology component of turnkey service revenue in the gulf of mexico was evaluated against our objectives but proved insufficient to outweigh the risk associated with the turnkey drilling business model 
as a result  the decision was made to exit the activity 
latin america revenue of billion grew over as all the geomarkets  except venezuela  posted revenue increases 
record revenue in mexico was mainly due to pemex drilling activity coupled with higher levels of ipm activity 

table of contents part ii  item increasing demand for ipm services in argentina  an increase in wireline activity associated with the peruvian jungle operations  and growing demand for rotary steerable systems in brazil also contributed to the revenue growth 
in venezuela  revenue decreased slightly on lower activity with pdvsa due to ongoing contract negotiation on certain integrated projects 
pretax operating income of million was flat over the substantial revenue growth did not materialize into higher operating income mainly because of a larger contribution of schlumberger managed third party services on ipm projects in mexico as well as an unfavorable revenue mix in mexico 
additionally  throughout the year  certain barges in west venezuela were partially idled while contractual negotiations continued with pdvsa 
europe cis africa revenue of billion increased over mainly due to russia  the caspian and west africa with gains recorded in all technologies led by drilling measurements and well services 
cis revenue reached million  a increase over activity was particularly sustained in russia mainly due to the continued expansion of the customer base and the deployment of new production related technologies 
the revenue growth was tempered by the halt of activities for yuganskneftegaz in russia in the fourth quarter 
however  successful redeployment of the equipment previously working for yuganskneftegaz was completed by the end of the year 
west africa continued to deliver robust performance achieving record activity levels mainly due to the development of deepwater projects combined with price increases through the introduction of new services and increasing demand for well services and well completions productivity technologies 
pretax operating income of million declined over mainly due to persistent union strikes in norway  redeployment costs and associated decreased operating efficiency in russia  weak results in north africa  and the appreciation of local currencies against the us dollar 
these were partially offset by the continued strengthening of activity in continental europe and the caspian 
middle east asia revenue in reached billion  increasing over the geomarkets in the middle east  malaysia and india primarily drove the growth 
activity in saudi arabia was focused on increasing production capacity  which resulted in higher levels of drilling activity throughout the year 
this trend is expected to continue in india reached record revenue with the ramp up in deepwater activity for ongc and deepwater exploration activity for reliance industries ltd 
activity in qatar continued to increase due to ongoing gas development projects in the north field 
also contributing to the record revenue level was the start of a new fracturing campaign in oman 
demand for well completions productivity technologies was particularly strong  mainly in the gulf from projects with rasgas  in saudi arabia from the commissioning of the abu safah project  and in malaysia from higher testing activities and artificial lift sales 
pretax operating income of million increased over primarily driven by india  due to a substantial increase in deepwater activity combined with strong technology deployment  the ramp up of favorable projects in the gulf  improved pricing on contract renewals  and new technology introductions 
key technology solutions that were deployed included the chdt cased hole dynamic tester tool  part of the suite of abc technology services  was used to identify a high pressured zone in a depleted reservoir in china  to acquire pressures and fluid samples in saudi arabia and abu dhabi  and to acquire samples and pressure readings in malaysia 

table of contents part ii  item in the gulf  demonstrated service quality and the introduction of new technology services led to the award of major contracts in qatar and oman 
these included a million  multi year wireline and tubing conveyed perforating contract by pdo for their north and south operations 
westerngeco results operating revenue for was billion versus billion in this strong performance was mainly attributable to the continued market acceptance of q technology  a higher level of multiclient sales and improved operating leverage in marine acquisition 
backlog reached an all time high of million at the end of compared to million at the end of last year  reflecting increasing exploration and production budgets for q technology revenues reached million in  representing of total revenue in  more than doubling the million achieved in utilization of the five q equipped vessels reached in the fourth quarter of q technology revenue is expected to grow by another in multiclient sales increased  to million  mainly in north america due to an especially strong central gulf of mexico lease sale  higher sales in asia  the caspian  south america and west africa reflecting an improved exploration spending environment 
approximately of the multiclient surveys sold in had no net book value due to prior amortization of capitalized costs  compared to approximately in and only of the revenue related to surveys that were impaired in and marine activity grew mainly from strong activity in the north sea  asia  india and the gulf of mexico  combined with higher vessel utilization  steady price increases and more favorable contractual terms regarding risk sharing with customers for downtime 
land activity increased mainly in the middle east reflecting higher activity in saudi arabia  algeria and kuwait 
the land seismic crew count increased from at the end of to at the end of data processing increased reflecting higher acquisition volumes  higher levels of q processing  and higher activity in south america and russia 
pretax operating income reached million in compared to million in due to accelerating demand for q marine coupled with improved pricing and increased vessel utilization  together with strong multiclient sales 
driven by q marine demand  westerngeco announced plans to convert two more vessels to q technology standards 
the first  the western regent  was completed and began operations in june of  while the second  western monarch  is expected to enter service in the second quarter of results the revenue increase of to billion in from billion in was mainly attributable to the successful expansion of q technology together with strong multiclient sales 
q revenues grew from million in to million in multiclient sales increased  to million  mainly in the gulf of mexico driven by the renewed interest in the library resulting from a higher oil price environment and an increasing number of blocks in the gulf of mexico coming up for renewal 
approximately of the multiclient surveys sold in had no net book value due to prior amortization of capitalized costs and only of the revenue related to surveys that were impaired in and land activity decreased reflecting the completion of some projects in malaysia and the middle east  and the shutdown of several crews active in the previous year in alaska  mexico and west africa 

table of contents part ii  item marine activity declined mainly as a result of the decision to reduce the number of vessels in the westerngeco fleet  coupled with adverse weather in latin america  lower activity in the caspian and a high number of vessel transits at the end of the year 
marine activity in the first half of is expected to recover with higher vessel utilization and improved pricing 
data processing increased reflecting higher acquisition volumes  higher levels of q processing  and robust third party work  coupled with improved operational efficiencies 
pretax operating income reached million in compared to a loss of million in due to lower amortization cost following the impairments of the multiclient library in and coupled with savings related to restructuring measures taken in  accelerating demand for reservoir focused q marine activity together with strong multiclient sales 
data processing also contributed to this improvement due to better operating efficiency 
the westerngeco backlog at the end of the year reached million  increasing over  of which is committed over the next year

table of contents part ii  item summary of major contractual commitments stated in millions payment period contractual commitments total after debt operating leases refer to note of the consolidated financial statement for details regarding potential commitments associated with schlumberger s prior business acquisitions 
schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit guarantees which relate to business performance bonds  custom excise tax commitments  facility lease rental obligations  etc 
these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a summary of all of schlumberger s significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
multiclient seismic data the westerngeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data 
such costs are charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data 
however  under no circumstance will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a year straight lined amortized value 
the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues  which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger  would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys 
significant adverse changes in schlumberger s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period 
for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library  future cash flows are analyzed based on two pools of surveys united states and non united states 
the united states and non united states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 
schlumberger recorded an impairment charge relating to the multiclient library of million in the carrying value of the library at december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
following the impairment charge  schlumberger will not generally commence a multiclient project unless the project is significantly pre funded by one or more customers 
the reduction in the carrying value of the library over recent years is primarily attributable to a cautious approach to new investment combined with the significant pre funding requirement 

table of contents part ii  item allowance for doubtful accounts schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve 
allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices  customer satisfaction claims and pricing discrepancies 
depending on how such potential issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of schlumberger s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowance may be required 
inventory reserves schlumberger writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas  schlumberger s reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment in addition to the westerngeco segment 
schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and or applying various market multiples 
from time to time a third party valuation expert may be utilized to assist in the determination of fair value 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
schlumberger s estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units was significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for  and long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in reviewing for impairment  the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset s recorded value  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to its estimated fair value 
the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management 
in order to estimate the fair value of a long lived asset  schlumberger may engage a third party to assist with the valuation

table of contents part ii  item investments schlumberger and smith international inc operate a drilling fluids joint venture of which schlumberger owns a interest and records income using the equity method of accounting 
schlumberger s investment at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the carrying value of this joint venture is evaluated for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates that a decline in the fair value of this investment that is other than temporary has occurred 
fair value is generally estimated by comparing the significance of this joint venture to smith international inc  a publicly traded company  and then referencing the market capitalization of smith international inc to date  schlumberger has not recorded any impairment charges relating to this investment as this analysis has indicated that the fair value of this investment is significantly in excess of its carrying value 
income taxes schlumberger s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the jurisdictions in which it conducts business 
these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or  potentially  through the courts 
tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits 
estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances 
however  due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates 
in such an event  schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the year in which such resolution occurs

due to a number of uncertainties  including uncertainty of timing  the scope of remediation  future technology  regulatory changes  natural resource or property damage claims and other factors  it is possible that the ultimate remediation costs may exceed the amounts estimated 
however  in the opinion of management  any such additional costs are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity  financial position or future results of operations 
the consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for estimated future expenditures  relating to potential contractual obligations  associated with business divestitures which have been completed 
it is possible that the ultimate expenditures may differ from the amounts recorded 
in the opinion of management  such differences are not expected to be material relative to consolidated liquidity  financial position or future results of operations

table of contents part ii  item pension and postretirement benefits schlumberger s pension benefit and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates 
these assumptions are important elements of expense and or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each fiscal year  or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events 
the discount rate we use reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations

a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases expense 
the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation  are expected to be paid 
the expected rate of return for schlumberger s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio  with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class 
the expected rate of return on plan assets was in both and a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 
schlumberger s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends
