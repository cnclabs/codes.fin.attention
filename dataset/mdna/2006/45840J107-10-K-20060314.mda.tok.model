business and market trends in  we experienced market conditions that were consistent with those we experienced during throughout this period  modest increases in spending by institutional customers for financial market data services were partially offset by the continuing impact of our customers ongoing cost containment initiatives 
we expect that  although institutional spending on financial market data and related services in may again increase modestly over levels  customers will continue to remain focused on controlling spending on such services 
institutional services within the institutional services segment  overall annual renewal rates for customer contracts remained at approximately in consistent with our experience in and we believe that much of the data we supply is mission critical to our customers operations regardless of market conditions  however  we are affected  at least in part  by the continuing cost containment focus within our institutional customer base 
if the data we provide were not mission critical  we believe declining market conditions would affect us more adversely 
there has been and continues to be a trend in north america for major financial institutions to outsource their back office operations to service bureaus and custodian banks 
we have established relationships with  and are a major data supplier to  many service bureaus and custodian banks  and have benefited and expect to continue to benefit from their growth and the outsourcing trend 
another trend occurring over the past decade is the consolidation of financial institutions both within and across the financial services industry 
when financial institutions merge  they frequently look to gain synergies by combining their operations  including the elimination of redundant data sources 
if our services are eliminated as a result of consolidation  there is generally a lag between the completion of the customer s consolidation activity and its impact on our service revenue 
additional consolidation activity has the potential to adversely impact our service revenue in the future 
ft interactive data s growth continues to be driven by new sales to existing customers  and  to a lesser extent  new sales to new customers 
in the us market  ft interactive data s growth in has been driven by increased demand for evaluated pricing and descriptive data services  coupled with strong retention rates and higher usage rates 
despite continuing challenging market conditions in europe  ft interactive data s business in the european market has continued to improve due to lower levels of contract cancellations and renegotiated contracts in as compared with the prior year 
growth in the ft interactive data business is dependent  in large part  on ft interactive data s ability to continue the expansion of its data content offerings to meet the current and evolving needs of its customers 
ft interactive data continues to enhance existing services and develop new offerings and establish business alliances 
table of contents to address changes in the financial markets  including recent and emerging regulatory requirements and increasing competitive pressures 
ft interactive data plans to broaden its coverage of complex derivative instruments 
in addition  ft interactive data will continue to seek to expand its market share in europe  although we expect continuing challenging market conditions to constrain our efforts in this region 
comstock s new sales in were largely offset by contract cancellations resulting from the final migration of the hyperfeed customers  which we acquired in november  onto the comstock platform in mid comstock will continue to enhance its offerings and focus on opportunities to expand its business with institutional customers 
the comstock business continued to experience price pressures  with customers remaining focused on cost containment 
in december  we supplemented the comstock business by acquiring is 
teledata ag and its subsidiaries for  offset by cash acquired of  as a result of subsequent acquisitions of is 
teledata shares from minority shareholders for an aggregate purchase price of  we owned approximately of this business  as of march  through is 
teledata  comstock now markets a suite of managed market data solutions that aggregate and customize the display of financial content that can be sourced from both the customer and from a number of information providers including comstock 
the cms bondedge business grew slightly in  due to increased business with existing customers as well as new customer installations 
cancellations arising from cms bondedge s customers cost cutting initiatives and consolidations continue to constrain growth 
contract cancellations were slightly higher in compared with cancellations experienced during the cms bondedge business is dependent on activity levels primarily in the us financial markets and the financial performance of major us financial institutions 
cms bondedge continues to invest in product and business development activities designed to expand business with existing and prospective customers in the united states and in europe and australia 
active trader services in the active trader services segment  the esignal business continued to strengthen its position as a leading financial data provider for active traders  individual investors and investment community professionals 
expansion of the esignal business is primarily dependent on the growth in online trading accounts managed by active traders 
in addition  stock market volatility is another important trend that can influence active trader subscriptions 
when the major stock markets are less volatile  active traders tend to trade less frequently and cancellations of esignal s services by active traders typically increase and new subscriptions slow 
subscriptions for esignal s array of services grew on a year over year basis through both direct and indirect sales distribution channels 
the esignal business was supplemented by the acquisition of the assets of futuresource  a privately held global provider of real time futures and commodities data 
in march  we supplemented the esignal business by acquiring the assets of quote 
com and certain other related assets from lycos  inc these assets include subscription based active trader services  qcharts and livecharts  and financial websites  quote

esignal continues to invest in adding new features to existing esignal  futuresource and quote 
com services  establishing relationships that can further expand its business with active traders worldwide  developing new offerings and building traffic to and advertising on its financial websites  marketcenter

we believe that esignal s future growth will result from a combination of expanding its direct subscriber base for real time financial market information and decision support tools and attracting increased online advertising on esignal s financial websites

table of contents the american jobs creation act of  or the act  became law on october  the act covers a wide range of business and tax issues and contains a number of changes to the internal revenue code

related party transactions we are a party to a management services agreement with pearson that became effective as of february  pearson  through a subsidiary  owns approximately of our issued and outstanding common stock 
this agreement governs the provision of services by either company and each company s subsidiaries to the other and renews annually 
pursuant to the agreement  pearson provides certain services to us and we provide certain services to pearson 
the services provided by pearson afford us administrative convenience and we believe the terms of such services are more favorable to us than if we had negotiated similar arrangements with non affiliated third parties 
the services provided by pearson include administering k  travel  employee benefit plans and insurance plans in the us and uk  use of a back up disaster recovery site  and billing  accounts payable  accounts receivable  computer and accounting system support  financial accounting  tax and payroll services related to certain of our subsidiaries  primarily in the uk

a majority of the charges for services to and from pearson and its affiliates are at cost 
prior to entering into any service arrangement with pearson  we assess whether it would be more advantageous to obtain such services from a third party 
the independent committee of our board of directors  which currently consists of four directors  none of whom are employees of pearson  approved the management services agreement on our behalf 
there was no material effect on our financial condition or results of operations as a result of entering into the agreement 
if pearson s services were to be terminated  we would be required to seek equivalent services in the open market at potentially increased costs 
the management services agreement is amended from time to time by mutual agreement to address changes in the terms or services provided to or on our behalf 
the independent committee approves any such modifications 
from time to time  we assess the ongoing relationships between us and pearson  and if we determine that it would be more advantageous to secure any such services outside of pearson  we pursue doing so 
in addition  in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in transactions with certain businesses that are owned by or affiliated with pearson 
certain of our businesses license financial market data and related services at commercial rates to certain businesses owned by or affiliated with pearson and also acquire a range of services related to specific financial market indices from certain businesses owned by or affiliated with pearson 
we believe that the terms and conditions of these transactions are fair and reasonable

table of contents in the third quarter of  we recorded a capital contribution from pearson of  for an adjustment to a liability attributed to a former affiliate of pearson that was sold in  prior to the merger of data broadcasting corporation and interactive data corporation 
this adjustment had no impact on our net income or on pearson s ownership percentage of our issued and outstanding common stock 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a capital contribution from pearson of  which represented the final settlement of certain employee benefit matters for which ultimate payment was not required 
on january   a member of our board of directors sold  shares of our common stock to pearson  bringing the total held by pearson to  or approximately of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of january  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue recognition is governed by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
the application of the appropriate accounting principle to our revenue is dependent upon the specific transaction 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sale price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized over contractual periods as services are performed 
we account for subscription revenue received in advance of service being performed by deferring such amounts until the related services are performed 
from time to time  we are required to adjust revenue associated with incorrect billings and data accessed inadvertently by customers 
we maintain a reserve for these adjustments based upon historical experience and believe that the reserve established as of december  is adequate 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is recorded in connection with business acquisitions and represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets at the acquisition date 
we perform impairment tests of goodwill assigned to our reporting units on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist 
each impairment test is based upon a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit  determined using a discounted cash flow model  to the net book value of the reporting unit 
projections used in these analyses are consistent with those used to manage our business and make capital allocation decisions 
if impairment is indicated due to the book value being in excess of the fair value  the goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
intangible assets include securities databases  computer software  covenants not to compete  and customer lists arising principally from acquisitions 
such intangible assets are recorded based on estimated fair value on the acquisition dates based on a combination of replacement cost and comparable purchase methodologies by a third party appraiser and are amortized over periods ranging from two to twenty five years 
the carrying amount of these 
table of contents balances is evaluated periodically by us in relation to the operating performance and fair value of the underlying assets 
adjustments are recorded if we determine that the fair value is less than book value 
income taxes we determine our income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the income tax expense includes an estimate of the current tax expense as well as a deferred tax expense which results from the determination of temporary differences arising from the different treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
we recognize future tax benefits or expenses attributable to our taxable temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards 
we recognize our deferred tax assets to the extent that the recoverability of these assets satisfy the more likely than not recognition criteria in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
based upon projections of future book and taxable income  we believe that the recorded tax assets will be realized 
we currently provide us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted 
us taxes have not been provided on approximately  of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings  which are expected to remain invested indefinitely 
commitments and contingencies we have no outstanding debt 
we meet our existing working capital and capital expenditure needs from our existing operating cash flow 
we have obligations under non cancelable operating leases for real estate  equipment  distribution agreements for satellite and cable space and fm radio channels and purchase obligations for data content 
certain of the leases include renewal options and escalation clauses 
real estate leases are for our corporate headquarters  sales offices  major operating units and data centers 
future contractual obligations  as of december   are summarized in the chart below 
payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations distribution agreements purchase obligations total we expect to satisfy our lease and other contractual obligations from our existing cash flow 
our key operating locations operate in facilities under long term leases  the earliest of which will expire in we believe we will be able to successfully negotiate key operating leases and or find alternative locations for our facilities without significant interruption to the business 
inflation although management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the results of operations during the past three years  there can be no assurance that results of operations will not be affected by inflation in the future 
seasonality and market activity historically  we have not experienced any material seasonal fluctuations in our business and we do not expect to experience seasonal fluctuations in the future 
however  financial information market demand is largely dependent upon activity levels in the securities markets 
in the event that the us or international financial markets were to suffer a prolonged downturn that results in a significant decline in investor activity in trading securities  our sales and service revenue could be adversely affected 
the degree of such consequences is uncertain 
our exposures in the us in this area could be mitigated in part by our service offerings in non us markets

consequently  changes in currency exchange rates may impact the translation of foreign statements of operations into us dollars  which may in turn affect our consolidated statements of operations
