item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an independent energy company focused on generating and developing natural gas prospects in appalachia and other regional basins with similar geologic characteristics 
historically  we have conducted most of our drilling initiatives through sponsored drilling programs  maintaining interests as both general partner and investor that range from to in development programs and up to in exploratory and other specialized programs 
through our operating subsidiaries  we also construct and maintain gas gathering systems for our wells and operate natural gas distribution facilities for two communities in kentucky 
all of our direct and indirect subsidiaries are wholly owned  and we account for our interests in drilling programs using the proportionate consolidation method  combining our share of program assets  liabilities  income and expenses with those of our separate operations 
results of operations and revenues 
total revenues for were  an increase of from  in our revenue mix for was contract drilling  oil and gas production and natural gas transmission and compression 
for  our total revenues were derived from contract drilling  from oil and gas production and from natural gas transmission and compression activities 
contract drilling revenues were  for  up from  in this reflects both the size and the timing of drilling program financings  from which we derive most of our contract drilling revenues 
upon the closing of drilling program financings  we receive the proceeds as customers drilling deposits under turnkey drilling contracts with the programs 
we recognize revenues from drilling operations on the completed contract method as the wells are drilled  rather than when funds are received 
during  we participated in gross net natural gas wells 
most of the wells were drilled under our turnkey contracts 
all of the wells have been completed as producers or successfully tested in at least one primary pay zone 
production revenues for were  an increase of from  in this reflects an increase of in our production volumes to  mmcfe in from mmcfe in part of our growth in production volumes resulted from our acquisitions of producing properties  primarily from sme in october and dart energy in the fourth quarter of it also reflects added production from new wells brought on line in  including wells connected in our leatherwood field during the year 
in addition to higher volumes  the growth in production revenues reflects a increase in our average sales price of natural gas before certain transportation charges to per mcf in from per mcf in principal purchasers of our natural gas production are gas marketers and customers with transmission facilities near our producing properties 
during  approximately of our natural gas production was sold under fixed price contracts and the balance primarily at prices determined monthly under formulas based on prevailing market indices 
gas transmission and compression revenues increased to  in  compared to  in this reflects continued reliance by sponsored drilling programs on our gathering systems 
during  we extended our natural gas gathering systems for new wells by over miles 
our gas transmission and compression revenues for also reflect a contribution of  from gas utility sales  compared to  in the prior period 
expenses 
total direct expenses increased by to  for in  compared to  in our direct expense mix for was contract drilling  oil and gas production and natural gas transmission and compression 
for  our total direct expenses were incurred in contract drilling  in oil and gas production and in natural gas transmission and compression 
contract drilling expenses in were  or of contract drilling revenues  compared to  or of contract drilling revenues in this primarily reflects the substantial level and complexity of recent drilling activities under our turnkey drilling contracts with sponsored drilling programs 
it also reflects substantial costs for downhole problems on several wells during and costs incurred to add lifting equipment and surface facilities for handling oil produced from a number of recently completed wells  primarily in our straight creek field 
production expenses were  in  compared to  in  reflecting our substantial growth in production volumes 
in addition to lifting costs  production expenses include field operating and maintenance costs  related overhead  third party transportation fees and lease operating expenses 
as a percentage of oil and gas production revenues  production expenses decreased to in from in gas transmission and compression expenses in were  compared to  in gas transmission and compression expenses do not reflect capitalized costs of  in for extensions of our gas gathering systems and additions to dehydration and compression capacity required to bring new wells on line 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were  in  an increase of from  in the increase in sg a expenses primarily reflects the timing and extent of our selling and promotional costs for sponsored drilling programs 
the higher sg a expenses for also reflect costs for supporting expanded operations as a whole  including additions to our staff and technology infrastructure as well as increased compensation and other employee related expenses 
as a percentage of total revenues  sg a expenses decreased to in compared to in the prior year 
beginning in  we adopted the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options 
under this method  employee stock options are valued at the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  and the compensation cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period 
in addition to accruals for deferred compensation costs of  in and  in  we recognized non cash charges of  in from fair value accounting for employee stock options  compared to  recognized in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased to  in  compared to  in the increase in dd a reflects substantial additions to our oil and gas properties and gas gathering systems during  as well as our sme acquisition in october interest expense for was  up from  in this reflects increased overall debt to support ongoing drilling and gas gathering initiatives 
we also had higher variable rates for our bank debt in see liquidity and capital resources below 
net income before income tax expense was  in  compared to  in we recognized income tax expense of  in  most of which was recorded as a future tax liability  reflecting application of a allocation of intangible drilling costs idc from our development drilling programs at the us operating company level 
net income and eps 
we realized net income of  in  compared to  in  reflecting the foregoing factors 
basic earnings per share eps was based on  weighted average common shares outstanding in  compared to based on  weighted average common shares outstanding in on a fully diluted basis  eps was on  weighted average common shares outstanding in  compared to on  weighted average common shares outstanding in and revenues

our gas transmission and compression revenues for also reflect a contribution of  from gas utility sales  up from  in expenses 
total direct expenses increased by to  in compared to  in our direct expense mix for was contract drilling  oil and gas production and natural gas transmission and compression 
for  our total direct expenses were incurred in contract drilling  in oil and gas production and in natural gas transmission and compression 
contract drilling expenses were  in  an increase of from  in this primarily reflects the substantial level of drilling activities on behalf of our sponsored drilling programs  as well as an increase of approximately feet in the average depth of our new wells 
the greater depth of these wells adds incrementally to the variable costs paid to outside contractors and to well completion complexities and expenditures 
the greater depth also adds to steel casing requirements  prices for which increased by over in production expenses increased to  in  compared to  in  reflecting our substantial growth in production volumes 
as a percentage of oil and gas production revenues  production expenses increased to in from in gas transmission and compression expenses in were  an increase from  in as a percentage of gas transmission and compression revenues  these expenses increased to in the from in gas transmission and compression expenses do not reflect capitalized costs of  in for extensions of our gas gathering systems and compression capacity required to bring new wells on line 
sg a expenses were  in  an increase of from  in the increase in sg a expenses was mainly from the extent and timing of selling and promotional costs we incurred for the drilling program financings completed at the end of and in the higher sg a expenses for also reflect costs for supporting expanded operations as a whole  including additions to our staff and technology infrastructure 
with the expansion of our operations  we also achieved various economies of scale  reflected by a decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenues to in compared to in in  we recognized  from fair value accounting for employee stock options  together with an accrual of  for deferred compensation costs 
we also restated our results for to record compensation cost of  which included a previously reported compensation charge of  from the exercise of employee stock options with a stock for stock or cashless exercise feature and from the issuance of common stock purchase warrants for corporate consulting services 
dd a increased to  in from  in the increase in dd a reflects additions to oil and gas properties  gas gathering systems and related equipment  as well as increased depletion from wells added in property acquisitions during interest expense for was  up from  in this reflects higher total debt to support our sme acquisition in october  when we added million of bank debt and million of convertible debt 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
in november  we received million from the sale of of the royalty interests included in a property acquisition completed earlier in the year 
in connection with the property acquisition  the parties had allocated  of the purchase price for the properties to the total royalty interests 
as a result  we realized a pre tax gain of million in the fourth quarter of on the sale of the partial royalty interests 
we recognized income tax expense of  in  of which  was recorded as a future tax liability 
our current income tax expense for was reduced to  primarily from our proportionate share of idc from an exploratory drilling program for the leatherwood field and a allocation of idc from our development drilling programs 
the functional allocation of idc from development drilling programs was initiated in to compensate for our full utilization of all loss carryforwards at the dpi level in net income and eps 
we realized net income of  in  compared to  in  reflecting the foregoing factors 
basic eps was based on  weighted average common shares outstanding in  compared to per share based on  weighted average common shares outstanding in on a fully diluted basis  eps was on  weighted average common shares outstanding in  compared to on  weighted average common shares outstanding in liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
net cash provided by our operating activities in was  our cash position during the year was decreased by the use of  in investing activities  reflecting net additions of  to our oil and gas properties 
these investments were funded in part with net cash of  from financing activities  comprised primarily of proceeds from convertible note financings of  in the first quarter and  in the fourth quarter of  as well as the exercise of outstanding warrants and options throughout the year 
financing activities also reflect the repayment of our credit facility during the fourth quarter of see capital resources below 
as a result of these activities  net cash increased to  at december  from  at december  net cash provided by our operating activities in was  our cash position during was decreased by the use of  in investing activities  reflecting net additions of  to our oil and gas properties 
these investments were funded in part with proceeds from institutional private placements of our common stock and convertible notes and from bank borrowings 
see capital resources below 
as a result of these activities  net cash decreased from  at december  to  at december  as of december   we had a working capital deficit of  this reflects wide fluctuations in our current assets and liabilities from the timing of customers deposits and expenditures under turnkey drilling contracts with our drilling programs 
since these fluctuations are normalized over relatively short time periods  we generally do not consider working capital to be a reliable measure of liquidity 
the working capital deficit at the end of is not expected to have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in future periods 
capital resources 
our business involves significant capital requirements 
the rate of production from oil and gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted 
without successful development activities  our proved reserves would decline as oil and gas is produced from our proved developed reserves 
our long term performance and profitability is dependent not only on developing existing oil and gas reserves  but also on our ability to find or acquire additional reserves on terms that are economically and operationally advantageous 
to fund our ongoing reserve development and acquisition activities  we have relied on a combination of cash flows from operations  bank borrowings and private placements of our convertible notes and equity securities  as well as participation by outside investors in our sponsored drilling programs 
we issued several series of convertible notes in private placements to finance a substantial part of our drilling and acquisition activities  including convertible notes in the aggregate principal amounts of  in the first quarter of and  in the notes were convertible at the option of the holders into our common stock at per share 
during  all the unconverted notes and prior series of notes were converted by their holders  either voluntarily or in response to our redemption calls  resulting in the issuance of  common shares 
in december  we completed an institutional private placement of our convertible notes due december  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holders at a conversion price of per share 
as part of private placement  we also issued warrants entitling the holders to purchase up to  shares of our common stock prior to august  at an exercise price of per share 
at december   the notes were recorded at  reflecting an allocation of  based on equity components of their conversion features and the related warrants 
the conversion price of the notes and exercise price of the warrants are subject to adjustments for certain dilutive issuances of common stock 
the purchase agreement for the notes also provides the holders with certain participation rights in future financing transactions and provides for us to use our best efforts to obtain shareholder approval at the next annual meeting for the issuance of the notes  warrants and underlying common shares 
under the terms of our convertible notes  if a holder elects to convert a note before the second anniversary of the issuance date  unless the prevailing market price of the common stock exceeds of the conversion price  the holder will be entitled to a payment equal to the difference between two years interest on the converted note and the interest already paid on the note  payable at our option in cash or in common shares 
after that date  if the prevailing market price of the common stock exceeds of the conversion price  we may redeem any unconverted notes at a redemption price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
any notes that are neither redeemed nor converted prior to maturity will be repayable in cash or in common shares 
any common shares issued for interest payments on converted notes or upon redemption at their maturity will generally be valued for that purpose at of their prevailing market price 
we maintain a credit facility with keybank na with a scheduled maturity date of july  the facility is secured by liens on all corporate assets  including a first mortgage on oil and gas interests and pipelines  as well as an assignment of major production and transportation contracts 
the interest rate under the facility fluctuates at above the bank s prime rate  amounting to at december  the maximum credit and borrowing base for the facility are determined periodically by the bank 
at december   the maximum credit and borrowing base for the facility were million and million  respectively 
borrowings of million outstanding at december  were repaid in the fourth quarter of the credit facility was amended in the first quarter of to increase the maximum credit and borrowing base to million and million  respectively 
the amendment also provides for a reduction of the interest rate for borrowings under the facility to above the bank s prime rate 
our ability to repay our bank debt and convertible notes will be subject to our future performance and prospects as well as market and general economic conditions 
we may be dependent on additional financings to repay our outstanding long term debt at maturity 
our future revenues  profitability and rate of growth will continue to be substantially dependent on the demand and market price for natural gas 
future market prices for natural gas will also have a significant impact on our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity  to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms and to continue attracting investment capital to drilling programs 
the market price for natural gas is subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control 
we expect our cash reserves and cash flow from operations to provide adequate working capital to meet our capital expenditure objectives through the middle of  including our pending gathering system acquisition and anticipated contributions to drilling programs 
see business recent initiatives gathering system acquisition and drilling programs 
to fully realize our financial goals for growth in revenues and reserves  we will continue to be dependent on the capital markets or other financing alternatives as well as continued participation by investors in future drilling programs 
forward looking statements some statements made by us in this report are prospective and constitute forward looking statements with in the meaning of section e of the exchange act 
other than statements of historical fact  all statements that address future activities  outcomes and other matters we plan  expect  budget  intend or estimate and other similar expressions are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
among other things  these include uncertainty about estimates of future natural gas production  increases in the cost of drilling  completion and gas collection or other costs of developing our reserves  unavailability of drilling rigs and services  uncertainty of production costs and estimates of required capital expenditures  drilling  operational and environmental risks  commodity price fluctuations  regulatory changes and litigation risks  and uncertainties in estimating proved oil and gas reserves  projecting future rates of production and timing of development and remedial expenditures 
if the assumptions we use in making forward looking statements prove incorrect or the risks described in this report occur  our actual results could differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
financial market risk interest rate risk 
our secured credit facility was amended in the first quarter of to increase the available borrowing base to million and reduce the interest rate on borrowing under the facility to above the bank s prime rate 
accordingly  interest expense on future borrowings under the facility will be sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states 
any substantial borrowings under the facility would expose us to this interest rate risk 
foreign market risk 
we sell our products and services exclusively in the united states and receive payment solely in united states dollars 
as a result  our financial results are unlikely to be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are parties to leases for office facilities and various types of equipment 
we are also obligated to make payments at specified times and amounts under instruments governing our long term debt and other commercial commitments 
the following table lists our minimum annual commitments as of december  under these instruments

related party transactions because we operate through subsidiaries and affiliated drilling programs  our holding company structure causes various agreements and transactions in the normal course of business to be treated as related party transactions 
it is our policy to structure any transactions with related parties only on terms that are no less favorable to the company than could be obtained on an arm s length basis from unrelated parties 
significant related party transactions are summarized in notes and of the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements and related disclosure included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including evaluations of any allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of long lived assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these evaluations form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  management believes that its estimates are reasonable and that actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts when deemed appropriate to reflect losses that could result from failures by customers or other parties to make payments on our trade receivables 
the estimates of this allowance  when maintained  are based on a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the trade accounts receivable  specific information obtained on the financial condition of customers and specific agreements or negotiated amounts with customers 
impairment of long lived assets 
our long lived assets include property and equipment and goodwill 
long lived assets with an indefinite life are reviewed at least annually for impairment  while other long lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values of these assets are not recoverable
