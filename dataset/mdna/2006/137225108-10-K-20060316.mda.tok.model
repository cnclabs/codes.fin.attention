item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
qualifying statement with respect to forward looking information and risks the following information contains forward looking information 
see caurtionary statement regarding forward looking statements above and forward looking statements below 
our activities and investments in our common stock involve a high degree of risk 
each of the risks in item a risk factors may have a significant impact on our future financial condition and results of operations 
the following should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included herein 
general we are an independent energy company engaged in operations located primarily in countries comprising the former soviet union involving the acquisition  exploration  development  production and marketing of crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas 
our principal means of growth has been through the acquisition and subsequent development and exploitation of producing oil and gas properties by means of entering into production sharing arrangements and licence arrangements with governmental or local oil companies 
as a result of our historical exploration and acquisition activities  we believe that we have a substantial inventory of exploitation and development opportunities  the successful completion of which is critical to the maintenance and growth of our current production levels 
we have incurred net losses in the last five years  and there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the following factors which most significantly affect our results of operations the sales prices of crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas  the level of total sales volumes of crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas  the availability of  and our ability to raise additional  capital resources and provide liquidity to meet cash flow needs  and the level and success of exploration and development activity 
reserves and production volumes year end gross total proved oil reserves at the ninotsminda field were mmbbl down from s mmbbl 
over the same period  gross total proved natural gas reserves 
table of contents increased from billion cubic feet to billion cubic feet  primarily with the addition of the kyzyloi field in kazakhstan 
because our proved reserves will decline as crude oil and natural gas and natural gas liquids are produced unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities  our reserves and production will decrease 
our ability to acquire or find additional reserves in the near future will be dependent  in part  upon the amount of available funds for acquisition  exploitation and development projects 
exploitation and development activity ninotsminda in june  we signed a contract with weus holding inc  a subsidiary of weatherford international ltd weatherford  for the supply of under balanced coiled tubing drilling ubctd services to our projects in georgia 
under the terms of the contract  weatherford were to supply and operate a ubctd unit to be used on a program of up to horizontal wellbores on our ninotsminda and samgori fields 
elsewhere in the oil industry  the use of under balanced drilling techniques has been shown to result in significantly less formation damage  resulting in higher sustained production rates and ultimate recovery 
at the same time  utilisation of coiled tubing drilling gives greater flexibility in the drilling process and in the control of the horizontal section 
it was considered that these combined drilling technologies would provide the best way to develop and produce both the ninotsminda and samgori fields 
we planned to drill at least five under balanced horizontal sidetracks on the ninotsminda field including nh nh a second horizontal well  nh east horizontal  from the n well bore which achieved good rates of production when drilled horizontally with conventional techniques and which was later the subject of a blow out in september  nh nh  and a new well n designed so as to have more than one horizontal wells drilled from it 
the n well was planned for the eastern part of the field  an area that is currently largely undeveloped 
ubctd operations started on the first well in the program  the nh well  in december the well is located in the east part of the ninotsminda field where the reservoir is tighter but it is believed to be relatively un drained 
we prepared the well with our own crew which involved sidetracking from the existing well bore at  feet  meters down to  feet  meters and setting a inch liner 
weatherford commenced operations in december  however technical problems with the weatherford equipment caused a number of delays which resulted in the under balanced drilling not being completed until late february  with a much shorter than planned section being drilled  and the well not achieving its objective  despite flowing gas at reported high rates through the gas cap section 
subsequent operations by weatherford on both nh and nh wells also proved unsuccessful  with weatherford failing to drill any horizontal section in these wells 
progress was hampered by multiple failures of the downhole motors  other equipment malfunctions and the loss of bottom hole assemblies in the wells 
following the failure of weatherford to successfully complete any horizontal sidetrack development wells on the ninotsminda field using ubctd technology  weatherford demobilized its equipment and left georgia in july despite this lack of success  which we attribute mainly to multiple equipment failures  we still believe that under balanced technology is an appropriate technology for the development of this type of reservoir 
in this respect  we continue to investigate the potential of bringing an alternative supplier of such equipment and services to georgia 
in the meantime  we have continued with our jointed pipe drilling operations using our own rigs and equipment and the directional drilling services of baker hughes international to drill horizontal sidetrack wells on the ninotsminda field 
on october  we reached total depth td on the first sidetrack  the nh well 
the well was completed in the middle eocene reservoir at approximately  feet  meters tvd true vertical depth having drilled a horizontal section of  feet meters 
a pre perforated liner was run over a  foot meters interval in the horizontal section and was tested at a rate of up to million cubic feet 
table of contents  cubic meters of gas per day plus barrels of condensate per day a total of  barrels oil equivalent on a inch mm choke with a flowing tubing head pressure fthp of atmospheres  psig 
the horizontal section is located in the uppermost part of the oil zone  close to the gas oil contact  and a permeable interval was encountered in the build up section within the lower part of the gas cap 
it is expected that the proportion of liquid hydrocarbon production will rise over time 
the well is currently choked back as we await completion of repairs by the state oil company  georgian oil  to the mile km pipeline which it is planned will deliver the gas from ninotsminda to the local state run thermal electricity generating station at gardabani 
terms have been agreed with the government for a gas supply agreement from the ninotsminda field and it is expected that an agreement will be signed in the near future 
in november  we announced that operations had commenced on the next horizontal sidetrack well on the ninotsminda field  nh 
this sidetrack was more complicated than the nh well as it is located on the northern flank of the field and it was be necessary to first sidetrack the well from a much shallower level towards the crest of the field before the horizontal section could be drilled through the reservoir in a westerly direction along the crest of the structure 
the well was drilled by us using our own rig and equipment while utilising directional equipment and services provided by baker hughes 
in february we announced that drilling been completed with a  feet meter horizontal section having been drilled through the middle eocene reservoir and a  feet meter slotted production liner run 
the wall is currently being tested 
in  on completion of the nh sidetrack  we plan to drill two further horizontal sidetrack wells from the n and n wells 
we have budgeted approximately million for such development work on the ninotsminda field in kyzyloi on the kyzyloi gas field a development program is underway 
bnm is involved in an extensive workover and testing program of wells on the field  with the last well in the program  kyz now in the process of being tested 
the six wells tested to date for the initial development have flowed at a cumulative rate of over million cubic feet  cubic meters of gas per day 
a mile km pipeline will be constructed to connect the kyzyloi development to the bukhara urals gas trunkline  with the initial planned production rate being million cubic feet  cubic meters per day and with first gas planned for late summer bnm believes that there is significant additional potential both in the kyzyloi field and in its surrounding akkulka exploration contract area 
as such the pipeline and associated facilities are being designed such that they could be upgraded to throughput up to million cubic feet million cubic meters per day of gas production 
production from the kyzyloi field will be delivered under a natural gas supply contract concluded between bnm and gaz impex in january the contract  which has a term until june  is based on a take or pay principle and covers all gas produced from the kyzyloi field production contract area 
the delivery point under the contract will be the planned tie in point to the bukhara urals gas trunkline 
the price of gas at the delivery point averages per mcf per mcm over the life of the contract  with gaz impex providing bank guarantees against payment 
bnm plans to invest million in the kyzyloi development in if crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas prices return to depressed levels or if our production from our development program does not deliver a significant production increase  our revenues  cash flow from operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected

table of contents exploration and appraisal manavi attempts to recover the damaged tubing from the m original oil discovery well on the manavi structure were unsuccessful and in late we commenced a sidetrack to this well 
despite an upgrade to our drilling equipment which included more powerful mud pumps and bicentrical drilling bits we continued to encounter drilling problems due to the extremely over pressured swelling clays above the reservoir intervals 
after extensive technical analysis and discussions with the international drilling contractor saipem spa saipem  and baker hughes international  a major drilling mud company  it was decided that the optimum way to sidetrack this well to the top of the reservoir as planned was to use an oil based mud system to control the swelling clays on the sapiem ideco e az drilling rig which is equipped with a top drive drilling system and can use an oil based mud system unlike our current ural mash rig 
service contracts were subsequently concluded with saipem to provide a rig and drilling services to the company and with baker hughes for the provision of an oil based mud system 
on august  we announced that the manavi mz well had reached a total depth td of  feet  meters measured depth md in the cretaceous 
the well was completed in the cretaceous using slim hole drilling technology due to the small size of the casing from which the well was sidetracked 
the primary cretaceous limestone target was encountered at  feet  meters md some feet meters md higher than in the original m well while the secondary middle eocene target zone was penetrated at  feet  meters md again significantly higher than in the m well 
drilling data and slim hole wireline logs indicate the presence of hydrocarbons in both the cretaceous and middle eocene target zones 
on october  we announced that we had commenced testing operations on mz 
a pre perforated inch mm liner was run in the slim hole  and the saipem drilling rig removed from the site while canargo rig was mobilized to the location for testing operations 
during initial testing operations it emerged that the section of the liner adjacent to the cretaceous limestone interval had become differentially stuck probably due to a build up of filter cake on and in the formation during drilling which is in itself indicative of a permeable zone 
although small amounts of oil and gas have been recovered from the well  no significant flow was achieved during the initial testing 
despite efforts to wash the mixture of drilling fluid and carbonate from the well bore using coiled tubing  it was not possible to clean out the formation and it appears that the cretaceous limestone formation has been blocked and is not in communication with the wellbore at this time 
schlumberger well completions experts were consulted who advised that the best techniques with which to re establish communication with the formation in the well by removing near wellbore damage is through the application of acid using coiled tubing  and if necessary perforate 
currently it is planned to carry out an acid stimulation and complete the well test using a schlumberger supplied coiled tubing unit  pumping equipment and completion fluids 
the delay in testing this well has been due to the difficulty in sourcing a coil tubing unit to georgia 
it is expected that testing will re commence in the mz well during april we have identified further appraisal locations on the manavi structure 
drilling operations at the first appraisal site  m using the saipem rig commenced on february  inch mm casing has now been set and the well is currently operating in inch mm hole section 
the well is located approximately miles km to the west of the m discovery well 
canargo rig was used to spud the well and drill the surface casing section to a depth  feet meters whilst saipem completed operations on the mk well 
m has a planned total depth of  feet  meters  and is expected to be completed in the summer of given significant production is tested from either the mz or the m wells  these wells would be placed on long term test production which would involve putting in place an early production facility 
norio on may  we announced that our subsidiary cnl had signed final documentation with georgian oil for cnl to secure of the contractor share in the norio psa 
on may  we paid georgian oil  to terminate their farm in agreement to the psa and secured a working interest in the norio psa and so 
table of contents enabled us to move forward with the completion of the mk exploration well 
operations had been suspended in when georgian oil were not able to finance the drilling of the well under their september farm in obligations 
in late june  we recommenced drilling operations on the suspended mk well and on august we announced that the saipem ideco e az drilling rig and baker hughes oil based mud system was being mobilized to the mk norio exploration well 
our ural mash rig had difficulty drilling through a highly over pressured section of swelling clays above the prognosed target zone and as the saipem rig with its oil based mud system had successfully drilled through a similar section in the mz well  it was considered that this afforded the best option to completing the well 
mk was sidetracked and successfully drilled through the over pressured section encountering the top of the middle eocene primary target zone at  feet  meters 
a inch millimetre liner was run to  feet  meters before drilling ahead through the reservoir using slim hole technology 
on december  we announced that the mk well reached a depth of  meters  feet in the middle eocene reservoir having encountered very good oil and gas shows 
gas levels up to were recorded at surface  as well as light oil in the mud and hydrocarbon fluorescence in the cuttings samples 
inflow was observed and it appeared that the small diameter hole collapsed around the bit 
although it may have been possible to mill down the bha and to sidetrack the hole  the small hole diameter and unstable hole conditions meant that there was a high risk that such an operation would not be successful and could take an indeterminate time 
as such it was decided to plug back the lower part of the hole and to concentrate on testing the oil bearing oligocene sands which were the secondary target for the well 
from the data obtained from the middle eocene the primary target for the well we believe that an oil discovery has been made at this level  and that the reservoir has exhibited both permeability and the presence of movable light oil 
as such  even though the middle eocene has not been fully evaluated  the mk well has encountered the middle eocene reservoir on prognosis  and with hydrocarbons thus achieving many of the objectives of this wildcat exploration well 
the lower section of the well has now been plugged back and the saipem rig has been moved to the m appraisal location while the canargo rig has been mobilised to the mk well location in preparation for the testing of the oligocene sand interval 
high penetration tubing conveyed and through tubing perforating guns have been imported from the united states for the test program 
ten separate zones of interest between  feet  meters md and  feet  meters md have been selected for testing 
the lowermost zone  a feet meter interval below the primary test zones has now been perforated  primarily to give formation pressure data for the main tests which are expected to commence shortly 
given significant production is tested  the well would be placed on long term test production 
in  we have budgeted approximately million for our exploration and appraisal work in georgia  primarily for the appraisal of the manavi discovery 
akkulka a five well exploration program targeting shallow gas anomalies which may be similar to the kyzyloi field is underway within the akkulka licence area with two new discoveries having already been made 
the akk exploration well  located some miles km east of the kyzyloi field  flowed gas at a stabilized flow rate of million cubic feet  cubic meters of gas per day  and akk now named north east kyzyloi  located miles km north east of the kyzyloi field  flowed gas at a rate of million cubic feet  cubic meters per day 
it is planned to apply for an extension to the kyzyloi field production contract to include the akk discovery  and to tie the akk discovery into the kyzyloi development  initially by way of a long term extended well test  but then by the application for a separate production contract  once the akk discovery has been fully evaluated 
in the other two exploration wells which have been drilled to date  akk and akk  gas indications have been observed during drilling and in thin sands on wireline logs 
these wells lie to the south east of the kyzyloi field  and may have encountered another gas deposit 
it is planned to test these wells as part of an integrated testing program in the near future but 
table of contents operations have been hampered by weather conditions 
the next exploration well  akk should commence once a rig is available from the kyzyloi development program 
initial work is now completed on a geophysical remapping of the akkulka exploration block 
this work has confirmed the presence of several potential shallow gas prospects some of which are being drilled in the current drilling program  and also some potentially large prospects at jurassic triassic levels 
regional geological studies suggest that these deeper prospects could have potential for gas condensate or oil deposits 
we have budgeted million for exploration work in kazakhstan in  primarily for exploration drilling on shallow gas targets in the later part of the year 
while a considerable amount of infrastructure for the ninotsminda field has already been put in place  and although tested gas wells exist on the kyzyloi field we cannot provide assurance that funding of the development plan for the fields will be timely  that the development plan will be successfully completed or will increase production  or that operating revenues from the fields after completion of the development plan will exceed operating costs 
to pursue existing projects beyond our immediate development plan and to pursue new opportunities  we will require additional capital 
while expected to be substantial  without further exploration work and evaluation the exact amount of funds needed to fully develop all of our oil and gas properties cannot at present  be quantified 
potential sources of funds include additional sales of equity securities  project financing  debt financing and the participation of other oil and gas entities in our projects 
based on our past history of raising capital and continuing discussions  management believes that such required funds may be available 
however  there is no assurance that such funds will be available  and if available  will be offered on attractive or acceptable terms 
should such funding not be forthcoming and we are unable to sell some or all of our non core assets  or  if sold  such sales realize insufficient proceeds  we may have to delay or abandon such projects 
development of the oil and gas properties and ventures in which we have interests involves multi year efforts and substantial cash expenditures 
full development of our oil and gas properties and ventures will require the availability of substantial additional financing from external sources 
we may also  where opportunities exist  seek to transfer portions of our interests in oil and gas properties and ventures to entities in exchange for such financing 
we generally have the principal responsibility for arranging financing for the oil and gas properties and ventures in which we have an interest 
there can be no assurance  however  that we or the entities that are developing the oil and gas properties and ventures will be able to arrange the financing necessary to develop the projects being undertaken or to support our corporate and other activities 
there can also be no assurance that such financing as is available will be on terms that are attractive or acceptable to or are deemed to be in the best interest of canargo  such entities and their respective stockholders or participants 
ultimate realization of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures will require production of oil and gas in sufficient quantities and marketing such oil and gas at sufficient prices to provide positive cash flow to us 
establishment of successful oil and gas operations is dependent upon  among other factors  the following mobilization of equipment and personnel to implement effectively drilling  completion and production activities  raising of additional capital  achieving significant production at costs that provide acceptable margins  reasonable levels of taxation  or economic arrangements in lieu of taxation in host countries  and the ability to market the oil and gas produced at or near world prices 
subject to our ability to raise additional capital  we have plans to mobilize resources and achieve levels of production and profits sufficient to recover the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures 
however  
table of contents if one or more of the above factors  or other factors  are different than anticipated  these plans may not be realized  and we may not recover the carrying value of our oil and gas properties and ventures 
availability of capital as described more fully under liquidity and capital resources below  our sources of capital are primarily cash on hand  cash from operating activities  project financing  debt financing  the participation of other oil and gas entities in our projects  and the proceeds from the sale of certain assets 
we may also attempt to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt or equity securities although no assurances can be made that we will be successful in any such efforts 
as of march   the company had an aggregate of  shares of common stock issued and outstanding and  authorized shares of common stock 
during  we issued  shares of which  shares were in connection with the standby equity distribution agreement with cornell capital   shares were in connection with the tethys acquisition   shares were in connection with exercise of stock options and  were in connection with a consultancy agreement related to investor relations services 
during  we have issued  shares of our common stock in connection with the conversion of a convertible loan 
as of march   an aggregate of  shares are reserved for issuance under various stock option plans  warrants and other contractual commitments  including the senior secured notes and the subordinated notes 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general the crude oil and natural gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business 
our current capital requirements are driven principally by our obligations to fund the following costs the development of existing properties  including drilling and completion costs of wells  and acquisition of interests in crude oil and natural gas properties 
the amount of capital available to us will affect our ability to continue to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties and  possibly  our ability to service any future debt obligations  if any 
our sources of capital are primarily cash on hand  cash from operating activities  project financing  debt financing  the participation of other oil and gas entities in our projects  and the sale of certain assets 
our overall liquidity depends heavily on the prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas and our production volumes of crude oil and natural gas 
we do not hedge our crude oil production 
accordingly  future crude oil and  to a lesser extent  natural gas price declines would have a material adverse effect on our overall results  and therefore  our liquidity 
low crude oil and natural gas prices could also negatively affect our ability to raise capital on terms favorable to us and could also reduce our ability to borrow in the future 
if the volume of crude oil we produce decreases  our cash flow from operations will decrease 
our production volumes will decline as reserves are produced 
we sold properties in and which reduced potential future reserves and in the future  we may sell additional properties and other assets  which could further reduce our production volumes and income from oil well drilling and servicing 
to offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties  we must conduct successful exploration  exploitation and development activities  acquire additional producing properties as we did with our acquisition of a interest in the samgori field in or identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
should our current exploration  exploitation and development wells in georgia prove unsuccessful and we were unable to raise additional debt or equity finance  we might have to cut back on our capital spending plans and or modify our operating plans to conserve cash 
as of december   we had working capital of  compared to working capital of  as of december  the  decrease in working capital from december  to december  is principally due to expenditures in the period to fund the cost of preparing wells for our horizontal development program at the ninotsminda field  the appraisal of our manavi oil discovery in georgia  further drilling of the norio exploration well  activities in kazakhstan and net cash used by operating activities partially offset by cash received pursuant to the takedowns under the seda and the senior secured notes 
in may  noc entered into a crude oil sales agreement with primrose financial group pfg to sell its monthly share of oil produced under the ninotsminda production sharing contract with a total contractual commitment of  metric tonnes  bbls sales agreement 
as security for payment and having the right to lift up to  metric tonnes approximately  bbls of oil per month  the buyer caused to be paid to noc  security deposit to be repaid at the end of the contract period either in money or through the delivery of additional crude oil equal to the value of the security 
the security deposit replaces the previous security payments totalling  which had been originally made available under previous oil sales agreements 
on february   noc and pfg agreed to the terminate the sales agreement and enter into a new agreement new agreement whereby pfg would receive an immediate repayment of its security deposit and obtain an extended term over which it can purchase crude oil produced from the ninotsminda field while noc receives better commercial terms for the sale of its production 
the new agreement has a minimum term of months and contains the following principal terms

noc s obligations are subject to customary force majeure provisions  title and risk of loss pass to buyer at the delivery point  noc agrees to assist the buyer to sell the oil locally or export oil in accordance with applicable law and the agreement is governed by english law 
certain asset sales in  we signed a sales agreement disposing of a megawatt duel fuel power generator for  and have received a non refundable deposit of approximately  the unit was shipped to the united states where it underwent tests in late on completion of these tests to the satisfaction of the buyer  we were to transfer title for this equipment and receive the final payment of  although the unit was successfully tested  the buyer failed to meet the sale contract terms resulting in the loss of its deposit in the third quarter  we are currently remarketing the generator 
on may   we announced that pursuant to a signed agreement between canargo acquisition corporation  our wholly owned subsidiary  and stanhope solutions ltd  we had completed a transaction to sell our interest in the bugruvativske field in ukraine through the disposal of our wholly owned subsidiary  lateral vector resources  for  we received  as an initial payment and will receive the remaining  based upon certain production targets being achieved on the project

we have no material long term capital commitments and are consequently able to adjust the level of our expenditures as circumstances dictate 
additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on the results of our development and appraisal programs  market conditions and other related economic factors 
should the prices of crude oil and natural gas decline from current levels  our cash flows will decrease which may result in a reduction of the capital expenditures budget 
if we decrease our capital expenditures budget  we may not be able to offset crude oil and natural gas production volume decreases caused by natural field declines and sales of producing properties

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial terms our principal business and assets are derived from production sharing contracts in georgia 
the legislative and procedural regimes governing production sharing contracts and mineral use licenses in georgia have undergone a series of changes in recent years resulting in certain legal uncertainties 
our production sharing contracts and mineral use licenses  entered into prior to the introduction in of a new petroleum law governing such agreements have not  as yet  been amended to reflect or ensure compliance with current legislation 
as a result  despite references in the current legislation grandfathering the terms and conditions of our production sharing contracts  conflicts between the interpretation of our production sharing contracts and mineral use licenses and current legislation could arise 
such conflicts  if they arose  could cause an adverse effect on our rights under the production sharing contracts 
however  the norio psa  the tbilisi psc and the samgori psc were concluded after enactment of the petroleum law  and under the terms and conditions of this legislation 
to confirm that the ninotsminda production sharing contract and the mineral usage license issued prior to the introduction in of the petroleum law were validly issued  in connection with its preparation of the convertible loan agreement with us  the international finance corporation  an affiliate of the world bank received in november confirmation from the state of georgia  that among other things the state of georgia recognizes and confirms the validity and enforceability of the production sharing contract and the license and all undertakings the state has covenanted with noc thereunder  the license was duly authorized and executed by the state at the time of its issuance and remained in full force and effect throughout its term  and the license constitutes a valid and duly authorized grant by the state  being and remaining in full force and effect as of the signing of this confirmation and the benefits of the license fully extend to noc by virtue of its interest in the license holder and the contractual rights under the production sharing contract 
despite this confirmation and the grandfathering of the terms of existing production sharing contracts in the petroleum law  subsequent legislative or other governmental changes could conflict with  challenge our rights or otherwise change current operations under the production sharing contract 
no challenge has been made to date 
in  the participation agreement for the three well exploration program on the ninotsminda manavi area with aes was terminated without aes earning any rights to any of the ninotsminda manavi area reservoirs 
the company therefore has no present obligations in respect of aes 
however  under a separate letter of agreement  if gas from the sub middle eocene is discovered and produced from the exploration area covered by the participation agreement  aes with be entitled to recover at the rate of of future gas sales from the sub middle eocene  net of operating costs  approximately  representing their prior funding under the participation agreement

this interest was acquired from gosl  a company wholly owned by georgian oil  by one of our subsidiaries  csl 
under the terms of the agreement dated january   we are required to participate in the drilling of up to horizontal wells on the samgori field as required under an earlier agreement between gosl and national petroleum limited npl the previous contractor party in the psc agreed work programme 
completion of well s  which was funded by us satisfied our commitment to gosl under the acquisition agreement  the remainder of the drilling program was to be funded jointly by csl and gosl  the contractor parties  pro rata their interest in the samgori psc 
the total cost to us of participating in the whole program  which was due to b e completed within months of the work commencement date wcd was anticipated to be up to  
table of contents furthermore  under the assignment agreement npl had agreed outstanding costs and expenses of  in relation to the samgori psc which were recoverable by npl receiving of annual net profit from the field until such costs had been fully repaid 
after npl s costs are repaid from either field production or other production in the psc in the event that new fields are developed in areas identified using seismic surveys originally performed by npl  npl would continue to receive of annual net profit 
under the samgori psc  up to of petroleum produced under the contract is allocated to the contractor parties for the recovery of the cumulative allowable capital  operating and other project costs associated with the samgori field and exploration in block xi b cost recovery oil 
the cost recovery pool includes the  costs previously incurred by npl 
the balance of production profit oil is allocated on a basis between the state and the contractor parties respectively until capital costs are recovered after which they would receive of profit oil 
under the samgori psc  georgian oil as the state representative in the contract is entitled to receive up to  tons approximately million barrels of oil base level oil from a maximum of per calendar quarter of production when the value of the cumulative cost recovery petroleum  cumulative profit oil and cumulative profit natural gas delivered to the contractor parties exceeds the cumulative allowable capital  operating and other project costs including finance costs associated with the samgori field and exploration in block xi b and the npl costs 
while base level oil is being delivered to georgian oil  the contractor parties will continue to be entitled to a maximum of of the remaining profit oil 
the base level oil is an estimate of the amount of oil that georgian oil would have expected to produce from the contract area had the state not come to a contractual arrangement with the previous contractor party in under the terms of the acquisition agreement with gosl  npl had an option to reacquire its contractor s interest in the samgori psc in the event that the agreed work program is not completed in part which involves the drilling of two horizontal well sections by september  and completed in full by june the work commencement date was specified as being no later than march   however gosl were reluctant to set the work commencement date at that time and obtained several extensions from npl to the work commencement date  with the last being until february  at that time npl were not prepared to further extend the work commencement date  and gosl were unwilling or unable to commit to their share of costs associated with the agreed work program

table of contents critical accounting policies natural gas and oil properties we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties 
we review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the full cost accounting rules of the sec and us generally accepted accounting principles 
under these rules  all such costs excluding significant acquisition  exploration and development costs related to unproved properties  are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test  however  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at percent plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
if the net capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties exceed the ceiling  we will record a ceiling test write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
if required  it reduces earnings and impacts shareholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the write down may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons  even if temporary  increases the probability of a ceiling test write down 
based on natural gas and oil prices in effect on december   the unamortized cost of our natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves 
natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any significant declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods 
natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
the uncertainties inherent in the disclosure are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we engage the services of an independent petroleum consulting firm to calculate reserves 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that it is reasonably possible the following material estimates affecting the financial statements could significantly change in the coming year estimates of proved oil and gas reserves  estimates as to the expected future cash flow from proved oil and gas properties  and estimates of future dismantlement and restoration costs 
concentration of credit risk although our cash and temporary investments and accounts receivable are exposed to potential credit loss  we do not believe such risk to be significant 
even though a substantial amount of funds were in accounts at financial institutions which were not covered under bank guarantees  management does not believe that maintaining balances in excess of bank guarantees resulted in a significant risk to the company 

table of contents foreign operations our future operations and earnings will depend upon the results of our operations in georgia and kazakhstan 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully conduct such operations  and a failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
also  the success of our operations will be subject to numerous contingencies  some of which are beyond management control 
these contingencies include general and regional economic conditions  prices for crude oil and natural gas  competition and changes in regulation 
since we are dependent on international operations  specifically those in georgia and kazakhstan  we will be subject to various additional political  economic and other uncertainties 
among other risks  our operations may be subject to the risks and restrictions on transfer of funds  import and export duties  quotas and embargoes  domestic and international customs and tariffs  and changing taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions  political conditions and regulations

opinion previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
when it is impracticable to determine the period specific effects of an accounting change on one or more individual prior periods presented  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position for that period rather than being reported in an income statement 
when it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of applying a change in accounting principle to all prior periods  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be applied as if it were adopted

sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the implementation of fas is not expected to have a significant effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
forward looking statements the forward looking statements contained in this item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are subject to various risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in such forward looking statements 
included among the important risks  uncertainties and other factors are those hereinafter discussed 
few of the forward looking statements in this annual report deal with matters that are within our unilateral control 
joint venture  acquisition  financing and other agreements and arrangements must be negotiated with independent third parties and  in some cases  must be approved by governmental agencies 
these third parties generally have objectives and interests that may not coincide with ours and may conflict with our interests 
unless we are able to compromise these conflicting objectives and interests in a mutually acceptable manner  agreements and arrangements with these third parties will not be consummated 
operating entities in various foreign jurisdictions must be registered by governmental agencies  and production licenses for development of oil and gas fields in various foreign jurisdictions must be granted by governmental agencies 
these governmental agencies generally have broad discretion in determining whether to take or approve various actions and matters 
in addition  the policies and practices of governmental agencies may be affected or altered by political  economic and other events occurring either within their own countries or in a broader international context 
finally  due to the developing nature of the legal regimes in many former soviet union countries where we operate  our contractual rights and remedies may be subject to certain legal uncertainties 
we do not have a majority of the equity in the entity that is the licensed developer of some projects   that we may pursue in the former soviet union  even though we may be the designated operator of the oil or gas field 
in these circumstances  the concurrence of co venturers may be required for various actions 
other parties influencing the timing of events may have priorities that differ from ours  even if they generally share our objectives 
as a result of all of the foregoing  among other matters  any forward looking statements regarding the occurrence and timing of future events may well anticipate results that will not be realized 
demands by or expectations of governments  co venturers  customers and others may affect our strategy regarding the various projects 
failure to meet such demands or expectations could adversely affect our participation in such projects or our ability to obtain or maintain necessary licenses and other approvals 
our ability to finance all of its present oil and gas projects and other ventures according to present plans is dependent upon obtaining additional funding 
an inability to obtain financing could require us to scale back or abandon part of all of our project development  capital expenditure  production and other plans 
the availability of equity or debt financing to us or to the entities that are developing projects in which hawse have interests is affected by many factors  including world economic conditions  the state international relations  the stability and policies of various governments located in areas in which we currently operate or intend to operate  fluctuations in the price of oil and gas  the general outlook for the oil and gas industry and competition for available funds  and an evaluation of us and specific projects in which we have an interest 
rising interest rates might affect the feasibility of debt financing that is offered 
potential investors and lenders will be influenced by their evaluations of us and our projects and comparisons with alternative investment opportunities 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to market risk is due to changes in oil and gas prices and currency fluctuations 
as indicated elsewhere in this report  as a producer of oil and gas we are exposed to changes in oil and gas prices as well as changes in supply and demand which could affect our revenues 
we do not engage in any commodity hedging activities 
due to the ready market for our production in georgia  we do not believe that any current exposures from this risk will materially affect our financial position at this time  but there can be no assurance that changes in such market will not affect us adversely in the future 
also as indicated elsewhere in this report  because all of our operations are being conducted in the former soviet union  we are potentially exposed to the market risk of fluctuations in the relative values of the currencies in areas in which we operate 
at present we do not engage in any currency hedging operations since  to the extent we receive payments for our production and marketing activities in local currencies  we are utilizing such currencies to pay for our local operations 
in addition  our contracts to sell our production from the ninotsminda field in georgia is denominated in u 
s 
dollars with all export contracts providing for payment in dollars  although we may not always be able to continue to demand payment in us dollars 
production from the kyzyloi field in kazakhstan will be delivered under a natural gas supply contract concluded between bnm and gaz impex in january with payment in u 
s 
dollars 
we had no material interest in investments subject to market risk during the period covered by this report 
because the majority of all revenue to us is from the sale of production from the ninotsminda field a change in the price of oil or a change in the production rates could have a substantial effect on this revenue and therefore profits 
assuming the same production in as but decreasing the net oil price we receive from sales by and respectively would change the total annual revenue from oil sales as follows 
the total annual revenue from oil sales for based on an average net oil price received of was  if the average net oil price received was less at then the total annual revenue from oil sales would be reduced by  to  if the average net oil price received was reduced by per barrel then the total annual revenue from oil sales realised would be reduced by  to  assuming all other factors are constant 
assuming constant oil prices a reduction in annual production by and would have the following effect on total annual revenues 
in total oil sales were  bbls of oil producing revenue of  if this was reduced by then the annual revenue from oil sales would be reduced to  if the total annual oil sales were reduced by or  bbls then the total annual revenue from oil sales would be  assuming all other factors are constant
