item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
apache s net cash provided by operating activities during totaled billion  up from billion in the increase in cash flow was primarily attributed to the significant increase in commodity prices 
the company s averaged realized oil and natural gas prices increased and percent  respectively  a reflection of higher worldwide commodity prices 
higher production also increased our cash flow on a percent and one percent increase in oil and natural gas production  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by higher production costs attributable to the effect of increased commodity prices  an increase in exchange rates in canada  north sea and australia  costs related to hurricane ivan and increases in costs from our stock based employee incentive programs 

table of contents historically  fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the company s short term changes in cash flow from operating activities 
sales volume changes have also impacted cash flow in the short term  but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in the past 
apache s long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices  reserve replacement and the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations 
debt during  we continued to strengthen our financial flexibility and to build on the solid financial positions of previous years 
we exited with a debt to capitalization ratio of percent  a decrease of seven percent from year end  with lower debt and increases in equity resulting from earnings 
at year end the company had long term debt of billion  million lower than year end  as the company s capital spending was less than internally generated cash flow 
the company s outstanding debt consisted of notes and debentures maturing in the years through approximately 
million  million  
million  million and billion mature in    and thereafter  respectively 
during  the company maintained its senior unsecured long term debt ratings of a from moody s  a from standard and poor s and a from fitch 
the company has a billion commercial paper program which enables apache to borrow funds for up to days at competitive interest rates 
there was no commercial paper outstanding as of december  the commercial paper balance of million on december  was classified as long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as the company had the ability and intent to refinance such amount on a long term basis through either the rollover of commercial paper or available borrowing capacity under its us credit facilities 
the weighted average interest rate for commercial paper was percent in and percent in as of december   available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities was billion 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand on december   compared to million on december  on may   the company entered into a new million revolving bank credit facility for the us  a million revolving bank credit facility for australia and a million revolving bank credit facility for canada 
these new facilities replaced the company s existing credit facilities in the same amounts which were scheduled to mature in june these new facilities are scheduled to mature on may  there were no changes to the company s million us credit facility which matures in may the financial covenants of the credit facilities require the company to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio of not greater than percent at the end of any fiscal quarter 
the negative covenants include restrictions on the company s ability to create liens and security interests on our assets  with exceptions for liens typically arising in the oil and gas industry  purchase money liens and liens arising as a matter of law  such as tax and mechanics liens 
the company may incur liens on assets located in the us  canada and australia of up to five percent of the company s consolidated assets  which approximated million on december  there are no restrictions on incurring liens in countries other than the us  canada and australia 
there are also restrictions on apache s ability to merge with another entity  unless the company is the surviving entity  and a restriction on our ability to guarantee debt of entities not within our consolidated group 
there are no clauses in the facilities that permit the lenders to accelerate payments or refuse to lend based on unspecified material adverse changes mac clauses 
the credit facility agreements do not have drawdown restrictions or prepayment obligations in the event of a decline in credit ratings 
however  the agreements allow the lenders to accelerate payments and terminate lending commitments if apache corporation  or any of its us  canadian and australian subsidiaries  defaults on any direct payment obligation in excess of million or has any unpaid  non appealable judgment against it in excess of million 
the company was in compliance with the terms of the credit facilities as of december  
table of contents stock transactions the company periodically uses access to equity capital markets to fund significant acquisitions 
on january   in conjunction with the bp transaction  we completed a public offering of approximately million shares of common stock  including million shares for the underwriters over allotment option  for net proceeds of million 
the company currently has no plans to access equity capital markets 
on december   we announced that holders of our common stock approved an increase in the number of authorized common shares to million from million in order to complete a previously announced two for one stock split 
the record date for the stock split was december  and the additional shares were distributed on january  oil and gas capital expenditures the company funded its exploration and production e d capital expenditures  including gathering  transportation and marketing gtm facilities  of billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively  primarily with internally generated cash flow of billion  billion and billion 
the company uses a combination of internally generated cash flow  borrowings under the company s lines of credit and commercial paper program and  from time to time  issues of public debt or common stock to fund its significant acquisitions 
during the three year period presented  the company primarily used internally generated cash flow or its lines of credit and commercial paper program  which were subsequently paid down with internally generated cash flow 
however  in  in conjunction with the bp acquisition  the company completed a public offering of approximately million shares of common stock  including million shares for the underwriters over allotment option  for net proceeds of million 
the following table presents a summary of the company s capital expenditures for each of our reportable segments for the past three years 
year ended december  in thousands exploration and development united states canada egypt australia north sea other international capitalized interest gas gathering transmission and processing facilities acquisitions oil and gas properties gas gathering  transmission and processing facilities the company completed its most active year to date  drilling  wells throughout and spending nearly million on oil and gas processing facilities and pipelines 
approximately two thirds of our exploration and development expenditures were invested in canada and the us  where nearly percent of apache s year end estimated proved reserves reside 
once again  canada was our most active region  drilling  wells with a percent success rate 
approximately percent of canada s wells were shallow development wells 
canada was also very active in the north grant lands  undeveloped acreage apache obtained through two farm in agreements with exxonmobil 
canada spent nearly million 
table of contents constructing gas processing plants  six of which were completed by the end of in the gulf coast region  even with the disruptions caused by the gulf of mexico hurricanes  we drilled wells  including offshore 
seventy seven percent of our gulf coast wells were productive 
our focus in the gulf coast region remained the same as  development and exploitation of our existing asset base including the gulf of mexico properties acquired from anadarko in the second half of the central region was the second most active region  drilling wells  with a percent success rate 
in the north sea  we drilled a total of wells  forties field wells  and invested approximately million of maintenance capital to continue to improve the operating efficiency of the forties field 
we expect to complete the forties power generation and gas ring by the summer of  which will greatly reduce fuel oil generating costs and improve production reliability 
in egypt  we had another active and successful exploration and development program  drilling wells of which percent were productive 
we also continued development of the qasr field  where gross production average mmcf d in december in australia  we participated in drilling wells  exploration wells and development wells 
china s capital expenditures were flat compared to as they continued their development drilling program 
the company spent million on acquisitions in compared to billion in  as the high price commodity market in limited the number of attractive acquisition opportunities 
those that were pursued were slated to close in the first quarter of acquisition expenditures typically vary year to year based on the availability of opportunities that fit apache s overall strategy 
in  apache drilled  wells and completed two significant acquisitions 
in the gulf of mexico  the majority of our activity focused in and around our existing asset base  including continued exploitation of the properties purchased from bp and shell in and the anadarko properties purchased in in the central region  where apache got its start  estimated proved reserves increased percent in through a combination of the exxonmobil acquisition and an active drilling year  completing of wells in the region 
canada was our most active area in with over  wells drilled  three fourths of which were shallow development wells  with over percent completed as producers 
at the forties field  an experienced workforce began tackling projects to extend the life of the largest field discovered in the united kingdom sector of the north sea 
production increases at forties the anchor of apache s newest core area were driven by apache s first drilling program since acquiring the field and a maintenance program aimed at improving efficiency of the field 
during  apache completed of wells drilled as part of a million capital program  including million of maintenance and operations capital expenditures 
in egypt and australia  apache continued its successful exploration programs with several new discoveries 
our continuing development program in egypt increased gross production to over  b d for the first time 
capital expenditures in china decreased in with the completion of production facilities and first production in the second half of in  apache added mmboe of estimated proved reserves through acquisitions  drilling and revisions 
during  gtm expenditures included additional gathering system pipelines in egypt and a gas plant expansion on varanus island in australia 
for  we plan another active year of drilling 
because we revise our estimates of exploration and development capital expenditures frequently throughout the year based on industry conditions and results to date  accurately projecting future expenditures is difficult at best 
however  our preliminary estimate of exploration and development capital and oil and gas processing facilities and pipelines is in excess of billion 
we generally do not project estimates for acquisitions because their timing is unpredictable  however  in early we closed an acquisition announced in late also  on january   the company announced an agreement with pioneer natural resources 
please refer to the subsequent acquisitions and divestiture section of this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we continually look for properties which we believe will add value and earn adequate rates of return and will take advantage of those opportunities as they arise 
cash dividend payments the company has paid cash dividends on its common stock for consecutive years through future dividend payments will depend on the company s level of earnings  financial requirements and other relevant factors 
common dividends paid during rose percent to million  reflecting the increase 
table of contents in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate 
the company increased its quarterly cash dividend percent  to cents per share from eight cents per share  effective with the november dividend payment 
during and  apache paid a total of million in dividends each year on its series b preferred stock issued in august see note  capital stock of item in this form k 
common dividends paid during rose percent to million  reflecting the increase in common shares outstanding and the higher common stock dividend rate 
contractual obligations we are subject to various financial obligations and commitments in the normal course of operations 
these contractual obligations represent known future cash payments that we are required to make and relate primarily to long term debt  operating leases  pipeline transportation commitments and international commitments 
the company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  see note  commitments and contingencies of item in this form k for further information regarding these obligations 
note contractual obligations reference total thereafter in thousands debt note    operating leases and other commitments note     international lease commitments note     operating costs associated with pre existing volumetric production payments on acquired properties note     total contractual obligations a b a this table does not include the estimated liability for dismantlement  abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties of billion 
the company records a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation 
see note  asset retirement obligation of item in this form k for further discussion 
b this table does not include the company s pension or postretirement benefit obligations 
see note  commitments and contingencies of item in this form k for further discussion 
apache is also subject to various contingent obligations that become payable only if certain events or rulings were to occur 
the inherent uncertainty surrounding the timing of and monetary impact associated with these events or rulings prevents any meaningful accurate measurement  which is necessary to assess any impact on future liquidity 
such obligations include environmental contingencies and potential settlements resulting from litigation 
apache s management feels that it has adequately reserved for its contingent obligations 
the company has reserved approximately million for environmental remediation 
the company has also reserved approximately million for various legal liabilities  in addition to the million  plus interest  we accrued for the texaco china bv litigation 
see note  commitments and contingencies of item in this form k for a detailed discussion of the company s environmental and legal contingencies 
the company accrued approximately million as of december   for an insurance contingency because of our involvement with oil insurance limited oil 
apache is a member of this insurance pool which insures specific property  pollution liability and other catastrophic risks of the company 
as part of its membership  the company is contractually committed to pay termination fees were we to elect to withdraw from oil 
apache does not anticipate withdrawal from the insurance pool  however  the potential termination 
table of contents fee is calculated annually based on past losses and the liability reflecting this potential charge has been accrued as required 
as discussed under note  acquisitions and divestitures of item in this form k  apache assumed obligations for pre existing vpps in the acquisition of properties from anadarko and the acquisition of properties from shell 
under the terms of the vpp agreements  apache is scheduled to deliver a total of mmboe in  mmboe in and mmboe in to morgan stanley as owner of the vpp interests 
morgan stanley is entitled to the first production and may demand up to percent of the production from the assets encumbered by each vpp in any given month to satisfy the vpp interests 
however  they have no right to look to other assets or production of apache 
apache does not record the reserves and production volumes attributable to the vpps 
as of december   apache has booked a total of mmboe of reserves attributable to the anadarko and shell transactions 
the vpps are non operating interests  free of costs incurred for operations and production 
apache provided a liability for these costs as reflected in the preceding table 
upon closing of our acquisition of the north sea properties  apache assumed bp s abandonment obligation for those properties and such costs were considered in determining the purchase price 
the purchase of the properties  however  did not relieve bp of its liabilities if apache fails to satisfy the abandonment obligation 
although not currently required  to ensure apache s payment of these costs  apache agreed to deliver a letter of credit to bp if the rating of our senior unsecured debt is lowered by both moody s and standard and poor s from the company s current ratings of a and a  respectively 
any such letter of credit would be in an amount equal to the net present value of future abandonment costs of the north sea properties as of the date of any such ratings change 
if apache is required to provide a letter of credit  it will expire if either rating agency restores its rating to the present level 
the letter of credit amount would be million british pounds  an amount that represents the letter of credit requirement through march  and will be negotiated annually based on apache s future abandonment obligation estimates 
the company s future liquidity could be impacted by a significant downgrade of its credit ratings by standard and poor s and moody s  however  we do not believe that such a sharp downgrade is reasonably likely 
the company s credit facilities do not require the company to maintain a minimum credit rating 
the negative covenants associated with our debt are outlined in greater detail under capital resources and liquidity  debt in this section of this form k 
in addition  generally under our commodity hedge agreements  apache may be required to post margin or terminate outstanding positions if the company s credit ratings decline significantly 
off balance sheet arrangements apache does not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions 
apache entered into a partnership with exxonmobil to obtain additional interests in specific west texas and new mexico oil gas properties acquired from exxonmobil in september as discussed in note  acquisitions and divestitures of item in this form k  apache contributed million into this partnership which was determined to be a variable interest entity as defined by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
variable interest entities 
apache concluded that they were not the primary beneficiary of the partnership and  therefore  proportionately consolidated only the company s portion of the oil and gas properties 
critical accounting policies and estimates full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
there are several significant differences between these methods 
under the successful efforts method  costs such as geological and geophysical g g  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred  where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to their respective full cost pool 
in the measurement of impairment of oil and gas properties  the 
table of contents successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method  the net book value full cost pool is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at percent using commodity prices in effect on the last day of the reporting period ceiling limitation 
if the full cost pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation  the excess amount is charged through income 
we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties 
under this method  the company capitalizes all acquisition  exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these finding activities 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
in addition  gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
as a result  we believe that the full cost method of accounting better reflects the true economics of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments 
generally  the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property results in higher capitalized costs and higher dd a rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts methods of accounting 
reserve estimates our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
as such  our reserve engineers review and revise the company s reserve estimates at least annually 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties  the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our dd a expense 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
we engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves 
during  and  their review covered  and percent of the reserve value  respectively 
costs excluded under the full cost method of accounting  oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized 
these amounts represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects 
apache excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly by the company s accounting  exploration and engineering staffs to determine if impairment has occurred 
nonproducing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the company s exploration program to date 
exploration costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon completion of drilling individual wells 
if geological and geophysical g g costs cannot be associated with specific properties  they are included in the amortization base as incurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being 
table of contents amortized the dd a pool or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a proved reserve base has not yet been established 
impairments transferred to the dd a pool increase the dd a rate for that country 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  all costs associated with a prospect or play would be considered quarterly for impairment upon full evaluation of such prospect or play 
this evaluation considers among other factors  seismic data  requirements to relinquish acreage  drilling results  remaining time in the commitment period  remaining capital plans  and political  economic  and market conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts we routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility 
many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties we operate 
thus  we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings 
our crude oil and natural gas receivables are typically collected within two months 
we accrue a reserve on a receivable when  based on the judgment of management  it is probable that a receivable will not be collected and the amount of any reserve may be reasonably estimated 
beginning in  we experienced a gradual decline in the timeliness of receipts from egpc for our egyptian oil and gas sales 
deteriorating economic conditions in egypt lessened the availability of us dollars  resulting in a one to two month delay in receipts from egpc 
during  we experienced wide variability in the timing of cash receipts  but our past due balance improved as of december  we have not established a reserve for these egyptian receivables because we continue to get paid  albeit late  and have no indication that we will not be able to collect our receivable 
asset retirement obligation the company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations 
apache s removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
prior to  under the full cost method of accounting  as described in the preceding critical accounting policy sections  the estimated undiscounted costs of the abandonment obligations  net of the value of salvage  were included as a component of our depletion base and expensed over the production life of the oil and gas properties 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
apache adopted this statement effective january   as discussed in note  asset retirement obligation of item of this form k 
sfas no 
significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets asset retirement obligations or aro 
primarily  the new statement requires the company to record a separate liability for the discounted present value of the company s asset retirement obligations  with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on the balance sheet 
as such  beginning in our depletion expense is reduced since we will deplete a discounted aro rather than the undiscounted value previously depleted in our oil and gas property base 
the lower depletion expense under sfas no 
is offset  however  by accretion expense  which reflects increases in the discounted asset retirement obligation over time 
inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 

table of contents income taxes our oil and gas exploration and production operations are currently located in seven countries 
as a result  we are subject to taxation on our income in numerous jurisdictions 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and gas prices 
the company regularly assesses and  if required  establishes accruals for tax contingencies that could result from assessments of additional tax by taxing jurisdictions in countries where the company operates 
tax reserves have been established  and include any related interest  despite the belief by the company that certain tax positions have been fully documented in the company s tax returns 
these reserves are subject to a significant amount of judgment and are reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis in light of changing facts and circumstances considering the progress of ongoing tax audits  case law and any new legislation 
the company believes that the reserves established are adequate in relation to the potential for any additional tax assessments 
derivatives apache uses derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility and foreign currency volatility 
the company accounts for the contracts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the estimated fair values of apache s derivative contracts within the scope of this statement are carried on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
for oil and gas derivative contracts designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges  realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the forecasted transaction occurs 
for foreign currency forward contracts designated as qualifying as cash flow hedges  realized gains and losses are generally recognized in lease operating expense when the forecasted transaction occurs 
sfas no 
requires that gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be marked to market and reported in current period income  rather than in the period in which the hedged transaction is settled 
realized gains and losses on derivative contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in other under revenues and other of the statement of consolidated operations 
the fair value estimate of apache s derivative contracts requires judgment  however  the company s derivative contracts are either exchange traded or valued by reference to commodities and currencies that are traded in highly liquid markets 
as such  the ultimate fair value is determined by references to readily available public data 
option valuations are verified against independent third party quotations 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  commodity risk in this form k for commodity price sensitivity information and the company s policies related to the use of derivatives 
stock based compensation during  apache began modifying its stock compensation plans in order to reflect the cost of these plans in the statement of consolidated operations 
as part of this effort  apache began issuing stock appreciation rights and restricted stock and  effective january   adopted the expense provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  as amended  on a prospective basis for all stock options granted under the company s existing option plans 
consistent with the company s desire to reflect the ultimate cost of stock compensation plans on the income statement  apache early adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment upon the fasb s issuance of the revised statement in the fourth quarter upon adoption of sfas no 
r  all stock based compensation awards that vested during are now reflected in the company s net income for the year 
awards that vested in prior years continue to be 
table of contents reflected in the income statement under the accounting guidelines in place for the applicable year 
awards granted in future periods will be valued on the date of grant and expensed using a straight line basis over the required service period 
pro forma income statement presentations have been provided for in note summary of significant accounting policies of item in this form k to present a comparative basis of all plans outstanding during the reported periods 
the company chose to adopt the statement under the modified retrospective approach as prescribed under sfas no 
r 
under this approach  the company is required to expense all options and stock based compensation that vested during the year of adoption based on the fair value of the stock compensation determined on the date of grant 
had the company not early adopted sfas no 
r under this transition approach  net income would have been lower by million million after tax or 
per diluted share 
normally  net income would be negatively impacted by adopting sfas no 
r under this transition method 
however  the company s share appreciation plan  which triggered in  has a fair market value based expense recorded under the provisions of sfas no 
r that is substantially less than the intrinsic value cost that would have been recorded under the provisions of apb opinion no 
please refer to note  capital stock of item of this form k for a detailed description of the share appreciation plan and costs associated with our stock compensation plans 
also  inherent in expensing stock options and other stock based compensation under sfas no 
r are several judgments and estimates that must be made 
these include determining the underlying valuation methodology for stock compensation awards and the related inputs utilized in each valuation  such as the company s expected stock price volatility  expected term of the employee option  expected dividend yield  the expected risk free interest rate  the underlying stock price and the exercise price of the option 
changes to these assumptions could result in different valuations for individual share awards and will be carefully scrutinized for each material grant 
for option valuations  apache utilizes the black scholes option pricing model  however  the company does run lattice models to verify that the assumptions used are reasonable 
for valuing the share appreciation awards  the company utilizes a monte carlo simulation model developed by a third party 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk the major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to our united states and canadian natural gas production 
prices received for oil and gas production have been and remain volatile and unpredictable 
monthly oil price realizations  including the impact of fixed price contracts and hedges  ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during average gas price realizations  including the impact of fixed price contracts and hedges  ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf during the same period 
based on the company s worldwide oil production levels  a per barrel change in the weighted average realized price of oil would increase or decrease revenues by million 
based on the company s worldwide gas production levels  a 
per mcf change in the weighted average realized price of gas would increase or decrease revenues by million 
if oil and gas prices decline significantly  even if only for a short period of time  it is possible that non cash write downs of our oil and gas properties could occur under the full cost accounting method allowed by the securities exchange commission sec 
under these rules  we review the carrying value of our proved oil and gas properties each quarter on a country by country basis to ensure that capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  and deferred income taxes do not exceed the ceiling 
this ceiling is the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  net of related tax effects 
if capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  the excess is charged to additional dd a expense 
the calculation of estimated future net cash flows is based on the prices for crude oil and natural gas in effect on the last day of each fiscal quarter except for volumes sold under 
table of contents long term contracts 
write downs required by these rules do not impact cash flow from operating activities  however  as discussed above  sustained low prices would have a material adverse effect on future cash flows 
we periodically enter into hedging activities on a portion of our projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our overall exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
apache may use futures contracts  swaps  options and fixed price physical contracts to hedge its commodity prices 
realized gains or losses from the company s price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the associated production occurs 
apache does not generally hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as indicated in note  hedging and derivative instruments of item in this form k  the company entered into several derivative positions in conjunction with our and acquisitions 
these positions were entered into to preserve our strong financial position in a period of cyclically high oil and gas prices and were designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated production 
apache has historically only hedged long term oil and gas prices related to a portion of its expected production associated with acquisitions 
as such  the company s use of hedging activity remains at a correspondingly low level 
in  financial derivative hedges represented approximately nine percent of the total worldwide natural gas production and six percent of the total worldwide crude oil production 
heading into  hedges in place are entirely related to us production and will represent approximately seven percent of worldwide production for natural gas and crude oil 
on december   the company had open natural gas derivative positions with a fair value of million 
a percent increase in natural gas prices would reduce the fair value by approximately million  while a percent decrease in prices would increase the fair value by approximately million 
the company also had open crude oil derivative positions with a fair value of million 
a percent change in oil prices would change the fair value by plus or minus million 
these fair value changes assume volatility based on prevailing market parameters at december  see note  hedging and derivative instruments of item in this form k for notional volumes and terms associated with the company s derivative contracts 
apache conducts its risk management activities for its commodities under the controls and governance of its risk management policy 
the risk management committee  comprising the chief financial officer  controller  treasurer and other key members of apache s management  approve and oversee these controls  which have been implemented by designated members of the treasury department 
the treasury and accounting departments also provide separate checks and reviews on the results of hedging activities 
controls for our commodity risk management activities include limits on credit  limits on volume  segregation of duties  delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls 
governmental risk apache s us and international operations have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state and local laws and regulations impacting production levels  taxes  environmental requirements and other assessments including a potential windfall profits tax 
the company anticipates that announced changes to the taxation scheme in the north sea will impact that region s results 
primarily  the corporate tax rate in the north sea is expected to increase percent to an effective rate of percent 
once the announcement is ratified  the new rate change will be effective as of january  weather and climate risk demand for oil and natural gas are  to a significant degree  dependent on weather and climate  which impacts the price we receive for the commodities we produce 
in addition  our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather  such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged 
table of contents equipment 
while our planning for normal climatic variation  insurance program  and emergency recovery plans mitigate the effects of the weather  not all such effects can be predicted  eliminated or insured against
