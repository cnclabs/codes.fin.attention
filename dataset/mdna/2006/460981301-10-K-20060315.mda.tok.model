item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under risk factors forward looking statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we commenced operations in and initially focused our efforts on building our infrastructure  including the establishment of management systems and procedures  customer service and relationships with vendors to provide data processing and information delivery services 
initial subscriber acquisition efforts were focused on unendorsed marketing  which entailed soliciting new subscribers without the benefit of a client marketing relationship 
in march  we entered into a client marketing agreement with american express and began to focus our marketing strategy on endorsed partnerships with the major financial institutions and financial services companies 
we have grown from approximately  subscribers as of december  to approximately million subscribers as of december  initially  we acquired subscribers principally through direct marketing arrangements primarily through telemarketing and direct mail where we incurred the marketing cost or  in some cases  shared marketing arrangements in which we shared the marketing cost with the client 
although this channel was effective in growing our subscriber base  it required a significant up front cash investment for each new subscriber 
beginning in late  we expanded our subscriber acquisition channels to include indirect marketing arrangements  in which our clients bear the marketing costs 
since  we have experienced a significant increase in subscribers acquired through indirect marketing relationships 
subscribers from indirect marketing arrangements have grown to represent approximately of total subscribers as of december  compared to as of december  and as of december  we also market our services directly to consumers and small business owners 
we expect to significantly expand these marketing efforts in in addition  we have recently launched our new fraud protection services for consumers  which include a variety of tools to detect identity theft and fraud 
we also have launched a new version of our small business services  which provides small business owners combined business and personal credit information 
as shown in the following table  the number of subscribers from our indirect  direct and shared marketing arrangements  have increased over the past three fiscal years 
as of december  indirect marketing arrangements direct and shared marketing arrangements total subscribers while our direct and shared marketing arrangements tend to provide us higher operating margins in periods after the marketing costs have been amortized  under our indirect arrangements we receive higher operating margins in the first year  have the opportunity to acquire a greater number of subscribers and generally experience improved retention due to marketing primarily through inbound channels 
the classification of a client relationship as direct  indirect or shared is based on whether we or the client pay the marketing expenses 
our accounting policies for revenue recognition  however  are not based on the classification of a client arrangement as direct  indirect or shared 
we look to the specific client arrangement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition policy  as discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the number of cancellations within the first days as a percentage of new subscribers was in  in and in the number of cancellations within the first days of subscription  as a percentage of new subscribers was higher during the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
we believe this to be the result of a higher number of additions during the quarter ended december  as previously disclosed  the high number of additions during the quarter ended december  included thousand customer enrollments from prior quarters which were not received by us until october as the result of a processing delay at one of our clients 
we analyze subscriber cancellations during the first days because we believe this time period affords the subscriber the opportunity to evaluate the service 
the number of cancellations after the first days  which are measured as a percentage of the number of subscribers at the beginning of the year plus new subscribers during the year less cancellations within the first days  was in  in and in the total number of cancellations during the year as a percentage of the beginning of the year subscribers plus new subscriber additions  was in  in and in conversely  our retention rates  calculated by taking subscribers at the end of the year divided by subscribers at the beginning of the year plus additions for the year  increased from in to in and in we believe that the increased retention rates in and compared to is due to the increase in indirect marketing arrangements and their primary marketing via inbound marketing channels  improved retention strategies  enhancement of our customer service centers  improvements in our service features and increased consumer awareness of the usefulness of the services we provide 
we became profitable during the second quarter of our profitability is due to several factors  including an increasing base of subscribers from existing clients  an increase in subscribers obtained through indirect marketing arrangements  improved economies of scale  and to a lesser extent  an increase in one time transactional sales 
in addition  we expect to remain profitable in the future as our base of subscribers continues to grow  revenue generated from indirect marketing arrangements increases  revenue increases from services marketed directly to consumers and our acquisition of abi  and revenue from new clients 
since  we have focused on monthly billed services and de emphasized annual subscriptions due to increased market acceptance by the consumer and client  and generally higher annualized prices and overall profitability 
annual subscribers represent less than of our subscriber base 
by focusing on monthly billed services  we experienced an increase in acquisitions  a higher retention rate and a reduction of the percentage of credit card transactions that are declined 
any subscriber can cancel his or her subscription at any time  in which case we will cease billing the subscriber 
for an annual subscription  upon cancellation  the subscriber generally would receive a pro rata refund of the annual fee for the unused portion of the service 
under those arrangements where a commission is paid to the client  if we refund a subscription fee  we are entitled to a refund of the related commission paid to the client 
revenue from subscribers obtained through our largest clients in and as a percentage of total revenue  and the principal contract arrangements with those clients  were as follows percentage of revenue for the years ended december  client relationship expiration or termination american express shared marketing terminated on december  on december  we signed a services transition agreement with american express

on november   we completed the acquisition of american background information services  inc abi pursuant to a stock purchase agreement 
we acquired all of the outstanding stock of abi for million in cash 
in addition  we paid approximately million to retire the outstanding bank debt of abi 
we have agreed with the selling shareholders that million of the purchase price will be held in escrow until may as security for any claims we may have under the stock purchase agreement 
abi is in the business of providing a variety of personnel risk management tools for the purpose of pre employment background screening  including criminal background checks  driving records  employment verification and reference checks  drug testing and credit history checks to businesses 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for additional information  see note to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we receive revenue from recurring revenue from existing subscriptions  the sale of new subscriptions and one time transaction sales 
subscription fees recognized as revenue by us are generally billed to the subscriber s credit card on a monthly basis directly by our client or through our credit card processor 
the monthly prices to subscribers of various configurations of our services range from to per month 
a percentage of our revenue is received by some of our clients as a commission 
the point in time at which we recognize revenue from our services is determined in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue for monthly subscriptions is recognized in the month the subscription fee is earned 
for prepaid annual subscriptions with refund provisions whereby only the prorated subscription fee is refunded upon cancellation by the subscriber  deferred subscription fees are recorded when billed and amortized as subscription fee revenue on a straight line basis over the subscription period  generally one year 
revenue for annual subscription fees must be deferred if the subscriber has the right to cancel the service and receive a full refund at any time during the subscription period 
we recognize a pro rata portion of revenue earned upon expiration of the full refund period 
an allowance for refunds is established based on our actual cancellation experience 
we also provide services for which certain financial institution clients are the primary obligors directly to their customers 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized when earned  which is at the time we provide the service  generally on a monthly basis 
in addition  we generate revenue from the sale of one time credit reports and background screens  which is recognized when the report is completed 
the amount of revenue recorded by us is determined in accordance with fasb s emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which addresses whether a company should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained by the company amount billed less commissions or fees paid 
we generally record revenue on a gross basis in the amount that we bill the subscriber when our arrangements with financial institution clients provide for us to serve as the primary obligor in the transaction 
we have latitude in establishing price and we bear the risk of physical loss of inventory and credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
we generally record revenue in the amount that we bill our financial institution clients  and not the amount billed to their customers  when our financial institution client is the primary obligor  establishes price to the customer and bears the credit risk 
deferred subscription solicitation costs our deferred subscription solicitation costs consist of subscription acquisition costs  including telemarketing  web based marketing expenses and direct mail such as printing and postage 
telemarketing  web based marketing and direct mail expenses are direct response advertising costs  which are accounted for in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  reporting on advertising costs sop 
the recoverability of amounts capitalized as deferred subscription solicitation costs are evaluated at each balance sheet date  in accordance with sop  by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets on a cost pool basis to the probable remaining future benefit expected to result directly from such advertising costs 
probable remaining future benefit is estimated based upon historical subscriber patterns  and represents net revenues less costs to earn those revenues 
in estimating probable future benefit on a per subscriber basis we deduct our contractual cost to service that subscriber from the known sales price 
we then apply the future benefit on a per subscriber basis to the number of subscribers expected to be retained in the future to arrive at the total probable future benefit 
in estimating the number of subscribers we will retain ie  factoring in expected cancellations  we utilize historical subscriber patterns maintained by us that show attrition rates by client  product and marketing channel 
the total probable future benefit is then compared to the costs of a given marketing campaign ie  cost pools  and if the probable future benefit exceeds the cost pool  the amount is considered to be recoverable 
if direct response advertising costs were to exceed the estimated probable remaining future benefit  an adjustment would be made to the deferred subscription costs to the extent of any shortfall 
we amortize deferred subscription solicitation costs on a cost pool basis over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received  but no more than months 
commissions in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full refund provisions and monthly subscriptions are expensed in the month incurred  unless we are entitled to a refund of the commissions 
if annual subscriptions are cancelled prior to their initial terms  we are generally entitled to a full refund of the previously paid commission for those annual subscriptions with a full refund provision and a pro rata refund  equal to the unused portion of their subscription  for those annual subscriptions with a pro rata refund provision 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full commission refund provisions are deferred until the earlier of expiration of the refund privileges or cancellation 
once the refund privileges have expired  the commission costs are recognized ratably in the same pattern that the related revenue is recognized 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with pro rata refund provisions are deferred and charged to operations as the corresponding revenue is recognized 
if a subscription is cancelled  upon receipt of the refunded commission from our client  we record a reduction to the deferred commission 
software development costs we develop software for internal use and capitalize software development costs incurred during the application development stage in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and eitf  accounting for web site development costs 
costs incurred prior to and after the application development stage are charged to expense 
when the software is ready for its intended use  capitalization ceases and such costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life  which is generally three to five years 
in accordance with sop  the company regularly reviews its capitalized software projects for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as such  in the first quarter of  we re assessed the development effort related to our small business product in an effort to launch the product sooner and with less additional investment 
consequently  we decided to adopt an alternative approach resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss of approximately million related to software development costs 
in addition  we entered into a new agreement with a client that required an investment in new software resulting in an additional impairment loss of approximately thousand 
goodwill and other intangibles we review the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets and assess the remaining estimated useful lives of our intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
we review the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment by comparing such amounts to their fair values 
we are required to perform this comparison at least annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment 
we perform the impairment test as of october st of each year 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions 
a change in these underlying assumptions would cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such an event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge which would negatively impact earnings 
the goodwill and intangible balances at december  pertain to the acquisition of abi on november  recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and subsequently issued stock option related guidance 
this statement establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
it also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments 
entities will be required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
in april  the sec amended the compliance dates for sfas no 
r from fiscal periods beginning after june  to fiscal years beginning after june  the company will adopt sfas r beginning january  and elect the modified prospective method of transition 
this method of transition requires us to recognize compensation cost for all awards subsequent to adopting the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding upon adoption 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  however had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on december   intersections inc announced that its board of directors has approved the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested stock options previously awarded under the company s stock option plan 
all other terms and conditions applicable to such options  including the exercise prices  remain unchanged 
as a result of this action  options to purchase up to approximately thousand shares of common stock  which would otherwise have vested over the next years  became exercisable effective december  all of these options have exercise prices ranging from to per share 
based upon the closing stock price for the company s common stock of per share on december   all of these options were under water or out of the money at the time of acceleration 
of the accelerated options  approximately thousand options are held by executive officers and approximately thousand options are held by non employee directors 
outstanding options to purchase approximately thousand shares of intersections common stock  with per share exercise prices ranging from to  were not accelerated and remain subject to time share vesting 
as a result of the acceleration  intersections expects to eliminate anticipated stock option expense of approximately million in each of and and approximately thousand in on a pre tax basis  based upon the company s value calculations using the black scholes methodology 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections or sfas  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
the statement applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles  and changes for accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impractical to do so 
sfas will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations except to the extent that the statement requires retroactive application in circumstances that would previously have been effected in the period of change under apb no 
recent developments american express our relationship with american express travel related services  or american express amex  was a shared marketing arrangement under an agreement that expired on december  on december  we signed a services transition agreement with american express 
pursuant to the services transition agreement  intersections will provide its current consumer services through may  to subscribers who pay for the service through their amex credit cards 
we are compensated for those services through april  based on the commission structure in effect under the consumer credit information services agreement  and from may  to may  based on a service fee per subscriber 
we will not service those subscribers after may  the services transition agreement also provides that we maintain the perpetual and unrestricted right to provide our services to all subscribers who are currently paying for the consumer services through payment vehicles other than amex credit cards  and to all subscribers who are receiving our combined personal and business credit information services regardless of how those subscribers are billed 
we will not pay any commission on those subscribers after january  intersections will have the right to offer intersections other products and services to those subscribers  and the services transition agreement prohibits either party from knowingly soliciting subscribers retained by the other party under the agreement 
as a result of the services transition agreement  after may   we will cease servicing approximately of our subscribers obtained through american express  which accounts for approximately of the revenue generated through the american express relationship 
as of december   the total subscribers obtained through the amex relationship represented fewer than ten percent of intersections total subscribers 
amex also reimbursed intersections in the amount of one million dollars  for certain marketing expenses incurred in and transition services expenses to be incurred through may  and has agreed to introduce us as a service provider to other units of amex 
in order to maintain and continue to grow our revenue  we will have to offset this loss of revenue from existing and new client relationships and other products and services 
any failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our revenue  results of operations and financial condition

the growth in our subscriber base has been accomplished primarily through continued marketing efforts with existing clients 
as shown in the table below  an increasing percentage of our subscribers and revenue is generated from indirect marketing arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate we do not have material exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency we have international sales in canada and  therefore  are subject to foreign currency rate exposure 
we collect fees from subscriptions in canadian currency and pay a portion of the related expenses in canadian currency  which mitigates our exposure to currency exchange rate risk 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions 
we have determined that the impact of the depreciation of the us dollar had an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows and we believe that a near term appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar will continue to have an insignificant effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not maintain any derivative instruments to mitigate the exposure to translation and transaction risk  however  this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future 
we will assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
the foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in our results of operations  and were not material for all periods presented
