item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s principal business is conducted by the bank and consists of a full range of community based financial services  including commercial and retail banking 
the profitability of the company s operations depends primarily on its net interest income  provision for loan losses  noninterest income  and noninterest expenses 
net interest income is the difference between the income the company receives on its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  which consists of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the provision for loan losses reflects the cost of credit risk in the company s loan portfolio 
noninterest income consists of service charges on deposit accounts  securities gains or losses  net trading profits or losses  gains on sales of loans  insurance and brokerage commissions  trust income  increase in cash surrender value of life insurance  and other noninterest income 
noninterest expenses include salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  professional services  and other noninterest expenses 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields on interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market interest rates and is dependent on the company s asset liability management procedures to cope with such changes 
the provision for loan losses is based upon management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions 
noninterest expenses are influenced by the growth of operations  with additional employees necessary to staff and open new bank branches  and marketing expenses necessary to promote them 
growth in the number of account relationships directly affects such expenses as data processing costs  supplies  postage  and other miscellaneous expenses 
the following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting the financial condition and results of operations of the company for the periods indicated 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the selected consolidated financial data presented herein 
in addition to historical information  the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
discussed below are those critical accounting policies that are of particular significance to the company 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
the company s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses represents an estimation pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the allowance reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of commercial  commercial real estate  and agricultural loans over  where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification 
these analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the company s historical loss factors are updated quarterly 
the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations and changes in portfolio mix and volume  and other qualitative factors 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examinations  may require the company to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
the process for determining the allowance which management believes adequately considers all of the potential factors which might possibly result in credit losses includes subjective elements and  therefore  may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect the company s earnings or financial position in future periods 
a loan is impaired when full payment under the loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage and consumer loans and on an individual basis for other loans 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
evaluation of securities for impairment securities are classified as held to maturity when the company has the ability and management has the positive intent to hold those securities to maturity 
accordingly  they are stated at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts 
securities are classified as available for sale when the company may decide to sell those securities due to changes in market interest rates  liquidity needs  changes in yields or alternative investments  and for other reasons 
they are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  reported in other comprehensive income loss 
interest income is reported net of amortization of premium and accretion of discount 
realized gains and losses on the disposition of securities available for sale are based on the net proceeds and the adjusted carrying amounts of the securities sold  using the specific identification method 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary losses  management considers the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the evaluation also considers the impact that impairment may have on future capital  earnings  and liquidity 
fair value of financial instruments and derivatives fair values of financial instruments  including derivatives  are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions 
fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates  credit risk  prepayments  and other factors  especially in the absence of broad markets for the particular items 
there is no ready market for a significant portion of the company s financial instruments 
accordingly  fair values are based on various factors relative to expected loss experience  current economic conditions  risk characteristics  and other factors 
the assumptions and estimates used in the fair value determination process are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment 
as a consequence  fair values cannot be determined with precision 
changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates

the following table reconciles reported net interest income on a tax equivalent basis for the periods presented net interest income tax equivalent adjustment to net interest income net interest income  fully tax equivalent basis includes construction loans 
includes million purchase accounting adjustment resulting from the prepayment of the fhlb advances which reduced interest expense 
changes in interest income and expense the changes in net interest income from period to period are reflective of changes in the interest rate environment  changes in the composition of assets and liabilities as to type and maturity and the inherent interest rate differences related thereto  and volume changes 
later sections of this discussion and analysis address the changes in maturity composition of loans and investments and in the asset and liability repricing gaps associated with interest rate risk  all of which contribute to changes in net interest margin 
the following table sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in interest income and interest expense of the company s average interest earning assets and average interest bearing liabilities for the indicated periods on a tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate in   and the table distinguishes between the changes related to average outstanding balances changes in volume holding the interest rate constant and the changes related to average interest rates changes in average rate holding the outstanding balance constant

total loans increased million  or  to billion at december  from december   however  the mix did not changed materially 
set forth below are other highlights of the loan portfolio 
commercial loans increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  construction loans increased by million to million as of december  from million at december  commercial real estate loans rose to million at december   an increase of from december  reflecting the addition of lending personnel to assist in the growth in this primary area of focus 
consumer loans increased million  or  as of december  compared to december  residential mortgage loans increased million to million as of december  from million as of december   as conforming adjustable rate and hybrid mortgages are retained rather than sold in secondary market 
many consumer residential mortgage loans the company originates are sold in the secondary market 
at any point in time  loans will be at various stages of the mortgage banking process 
included as part of consumer real estate loans are loans held for sale 
the carrying value of these loans approximated their market value at that time 
the company attempts to balance the types of loans in its portfolio with the objective of reducing risk 
some of the risks the company attempts to reduce include the primary risks associated with commercial loans are the quality of the borrower s management  financial strength and cash flow resources  and the impact of local economic factors 
risks associated with real estate loans include concentrations of loans in a certain loan type  such as commercial or residential  and fluctuating land and property values 
consumer loans also have risks associated with concentrations of loans in a single type of loan  as well as the risk a borrower may become unemployed as a result of deteriorating economic conditions 
loan maturities the following table sets forth the remaining maturities  based upon contractual dates  for selected loan categories as of december  years over years one year or less fixed variable fixed variable total in thousands commercial construction commercial real estate consumer home equity other consumer total consumer residential mortgage total loans  gross net deferred fees total loans the deferral period for net deferred fees typically matches the loan s scheduled maturity 
the company s data processing system currently limits its ability to break them out over the timeframes in the table 
nonaccruing loans the company s financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio 
the accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is days past due unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan 
in all cases  loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful 
all interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off is reversed against interest income 
the interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual 
loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
under sfas no 
and no 
 the company currently defines loans that are individually evaluated for impairment to include commercial  commercial real estate and agricultural loans over  that are in nonaccrual status or were restructured 
all other smaller balance loans with similar attributes such as auto are evaluated for impairment in total 
the classification of a loan as impaired or nonaccrual does not necessarily indicate that the principal is uncollectible  in whole or in part 
the company makes a determination as to the collectibility on a case by case basis based upon the specific facts of each situation 
the company considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect impaired or nonaccrual loans 
alternatives that are typically considered to collect impaired or nonaccrual loans are foreclosure  collection under guarantees  loan restructuring  or judicial collection actions 
loans that are considered to be impaired are reduced to the present value of expected future cash flows or to the fair value of the related collateral by allocating a portion of the allowance to such loans 
if these allocations require an increase to be made to the allowance for loan losses  such increase is reported as a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
the following table sets forth information on the company s nonaccruing loans and nonperforming assets as of the indicated dates 
december  dollars in thousands impaired and other loans days past due and accruing nonaccrual and impaired loans not accruing other real estate total nonperforming assets total nonaccruing loans to total loans total nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate total nonperforming assets to total assets during   and  the company recognized interest income on impaired loans of million  million and million  respectively 
nonaccruing loans decreased million or to million at december  from million at december  a number of problem loans were successfully collected during the year 
other real estate increased to million in from million in this increase was due to the acquisition of an office building and advertisement billboard from one loan customer which represents million of the total other real estate 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
total nonperforming assets increased by million from million in to million in analysis of allowance for loan losses the company recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan  and in the case of a collateralized loan  the quality of the collateral for such loan 
the allowance for loan losses represents the company s estimate of the amount deemed necessary to provide for probable incurred losses in the portfolio 
in making this determination  the company analyzes the ultimate collectibility of the loans in its portfolio by incorporating feedback provided by internal loan staff and information provided during examinations performed by regulatory agencies 
the company makes an ongoing evaluation as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
on a quarterly basis  management of the bank meets to review the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
each loan officer grades his or her individual commercial credits and the company s independent loan review personnel reviews the officers grades 
in the event that the loan is downgraded during this review  the loan is included in the allowance analysis at the lower grade 
the grading system is in compliance with the regulatory classifications  and the allowance is allocated to the loans based on the regulatory grading  except in instances where there are known differences eg collateral value is nominal 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
estimating the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
the company s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses represents an estimation done pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the allowance reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific credit allocations for individual loans and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the specific credit allocations are based on regular analyses of commercial  commercial real estate and agricultural loans over  where the internal credit rating is at or below a predetermined classification 
these analyses involve a high degree of judgment in estimating the amount of loss associated with specific loans  including estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values 
the company s historical loss factors are updated quarterly 
the allowance for loan losses also includes consideration of concentrations and changes in portfolio mix and volume  and other qualitative factors 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examinations  may require the company to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
the process for determining the allowance which management believes adequately considers all of the potential factors which potentially result in credit losses includes subjective elements and  therefore  may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect the company s earnings or financial position in future periods

see footnote to the table on page during and  the company experienced asset quality deterioration in commercial and commercial real estate loans 
asset quality has improved and is evidenced by the following net commercial loan charge offs were  in compared to  in net commercial real estate loan charge offs were  in compared to loans subject to adverse classification substandard and doubtful  as defined below have decreased to million at december  from million at december  the company has a reserve for losses on unfunded commitments of  at december  the company utilizes an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets 
at each scheduled bank board of directors meeting  a watch list is presented  showing significant loan relationships listed as special mention  substandard  and doubtful 
set forth below is a discussion of each of these classifications 
december  in thousands special mention substandard doubtful total classified total special mention and classified special mention a special mention extension of credit is defined as having potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention 
if left uncorrected  these potential weaknesses may  at some future date  result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the credit or the institution s credit position 
special mention credits are not considered as part of the classified extensions of credit category and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification 
they are currently protected but are potentially weak 
they constitute an undue and unwarranted credit risk 
loans in this category have some identifiable problem  most notably slowness in payments  but  in management s opinion  offer no immediate risk of loss 
an extension of credit that is not delinquent also may be identified as special mention 
these loans are classified due to bank management s actions or the servicing of the loan 
the lending officer may be unable to properly supervise the credit because of an inadequate loan or credit agreement 
there may be questions regarding the condition of and or control over collateral 
economic or market conditions may unfavorably affect the obligor in the future 
a declining trend in the obligor s operations or an imbalanced position in the balance sheet may exist  although it is not to the point that repayment is jeopardized 
another example of a special mention credit is one that has other deviations from prudent lending practices 
if the bank may have to consider relying on a secondary or alternative source of repayment  then collection may not yet be in jeopardy  but the loan may be considered special mention 
other trends that indicate that the loan may deteriorate further include such red flags as continuous overdrafts  negative trends on a financial statement  such as a deficit net worth  a delay in the receipt of financial statements  accounts receivable ageings  etc 
these loans on a regular basis can be days or more past due 
judgments  tax liens  delinquent real estate taxes  cancellation of insurance policies and exceptions to bank policies are other red flags 
substandard a substandard extension of credit is one inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
extensions of credit so classified must have a well defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
in other words  there is more than normal risk of loss 
loss potential  while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard credits  does not have to exist in individual extensions of credit classified substandard 
the likelihood that a substandard loan will be paid from the primary source of repayment may also be uncertain 
financial deterioration is underway and very close attention is warranted to insure that the loan is collected without a loss 
the bank may be relying on a secondary source of repayment  such as liquidating collateral  or collecting on guarantees 
the borrower cannot keep up with either the interest or principal payments 
if the bank is forced into a subordinated or unsecured position due to flaws in documentation  the loan may also be substandard 
if the loan must be restructured  or interest rate concessions made  it should be classified as such 
if the bank is contemplating foreclosure or legal action  the credit is likely substandard 
doubtful an extension of credit classified doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
the possibility of loss is extremely high  however  because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may work to the advantage of and strengthen the credit  its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status may be determined 
pending factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition  liquidation proceedings  capital injection  perfecting liens on additional collateral  or refinancing plans 
if the primary source of repayment is gone  and there is doubt as to the quality of the secondary source  then the loan will be considered doubtful 
if a court suit is pending  and is the only means of collection  a loan is generally doubtful 
as stated above  the loss amount in this category is often undeterminable  and the loan is classified doubtful until said loss can be determined 
the company s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the bank s primary regulators in the course of its regulatory examinations  which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request the company to materially increase its allowance for loan losses 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary 
the company s allowance for loan losses at december  is considered by management to be adequate

a new chief investment officer started in january the company has established a limit on the duration of all purchases to a maximum of years and on the premium paid to a maximum of of the underlying principal price of for mortgage backed securities 
these limits were set to reduce the prepayment risk in a declining interest rate environment

the company expects these securities to provide added liquidity to fund future loan growth 
accordingly  us government and government sponsored entity mortgage backed securities increased million  from million at december  to million at december  at december   approximately million of cash equivalents were proceeds received during december from liquidated securities sold during the initial balance sheet repositioning step 
as a result of changing the mix of the securities portfolio  the duration decreased to years at december  compared to years a year ago  and the average yield increased basis points to at december  equity securities decreased million  following the sale of the fnma series f perpetual preferred equity securities  from million at december  to million at december  equity securities included capital securities of us government sponsored entities 
obligations of state and political subdivisions increased million to million at december  from  at december  during  the company built up its tax exempt securities portfolio as part of its tax planning strategy 
other bonds decreased  to million at december  compared to million at december  other bonds include high grade corporate bonds primarily issued by financial institutions 
securities held to maturity decreased million  or  from million at december  to million at december   mainly due to the paydowns on mortgage backed securities 
there were no trading securities held at december  or december  the company holds trading securities and derivatives on a short term basis based on market and liquidity conditions 
compared to  trading activities have been curtailed with reductions in the volume of securities traded and number of transactions 
the company s strategies are being implemented by a new chief investment officer as of the beginning of as a result  management believes the risk in the securities portfolio has decreased significantly compared to the company intends to implement strategies to reduce its securities as a percentage of earning assets and provide funding for higher yielding loans 
the company expects the newly purchased securities mentioned above to provide added cash flow to fund future loan growth  its focus on future investment purchases will be to maintain an adequate level of liquidity and a shorter duration of its securities portfolio 
the company has a number of available for sale securities that have unrealized losses at december   see note to the notes to consolidated financials statements for further information 
during  the company recognized a million loss on securities deemed as other than temporarily impaired 
although this investment had a variable  tax advantaged dividend rate that resets every two years at the two year treasury rate less basis points and carried an investment grade rating  the market value of this investment was impacted by the current and expected level of interest rates 
while the company expected this investment to recover its original cost as interest rates increased and had both the intent and ability to hold the investment until such recovery occurred  this investment was deemed to be other than temporarily impaired given the duration of the unrealized loss position and uncertainty as to the timing of a full recovery 
it is the practice of the company not to retain securities that are classified other than temporarily impaired 
these securities were liquidated in february at an  gain in excess of the year end carrying value 
in  the company entered into  us treasury year note futures contracts with a notional value of million and a delivery date of march the company sold these contracts in order to hedge certain us government sponsored entities notes held in its available for sale portfolio 
the company s objective was to offset changes in the fair market value of the us government sponsored entities notes with changes in the fair market value of the futures contracts  thereby reducing interest rate risk 
the company documented these futures contracts as fair value hedges with the changes in market value of the futures contracts as well as the changes in the market value of the hedged items charged or credited to earnings on a quarterly basis in net gains losses on securities transactions 
the hedging relationship is assessed to ensure that there is a high correlation between the hedge instruments and hedged items 
for the year ending december   the change in the market values resulted in a net loss of million which was recorded in net gains losses on securities transactions compared to the  loss recorded for the year ended december  gains or losses for fair value hedges occur when changes in the market value of the hedged items are not identical to changes in the market value of hedge instruments during the reporting period

the company s marketing efforts focus on core deposit account growth in its retail markets 
the company competes for core deposits in the over banked chicago metropolitan statistical area 
competitive pricing has made it difficult to maintain and grow these types of deposits 
in the second quarter of  the company reduced pricing on its interest bearing demand  money market  and savings deposits to be in line with its peers 
the level of pressure for core deposits is not expected to ease in the near term 
to overcome this challenge  the company has changed and expanded staffing and management at its banking centers and initiated a number of customer outreach initiatives to expand deposits 
in addition  the company is in the process of creating a performance driven sales environment and increasing activity in its branches 
aggressive marketing of free checking and interest bearing demand accounts continues 
deposit growth is expected in the future as new customers are added due to the addition of new commercial and industrial loans and a commitment to relationship banking

in addition to the normal inflow of funds from core deposit growth  together with repayments and maturities of loans and securities  the company utilizes other short term  intermediate term and long term funding sources such as securities sold under agreements to repurchase  overnight funds purchased from correspondent banks and the acceptance of short term deposits from public entities 
the fhlb provides an additional source of liquidity which has been used by the bank extensively since assuming that collateral is available to secure loans  the bank can borrow up to of its assets from the fhlb which provided the bank with a total additional million in unused capacity at december  the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its current and future liquidity needs 
the bank also has various funding arrangements with commercial and investment banks providing up to billion of available funding sources in the form of federal funds lines  repurchase agreements  and brokered and public funds certificate of deposit programs 
unused capacity under these lines was billion at december  the bank maintains these funding arrangements to achieve favorable costs of funds  manage interest rate risk  and enhance liquidity in the event of deposit withdrawals 
the repurchase agreements and public funds certificate of deposit are subject to the availability of collateral 
the company monitors and manages its liquidity position on several levels  which vary depending upon the time period 
as the time period is expanded  other data is factored in  including estimated loan funding requirements  estimated loan payoffs  securities portfolio maturities or calls  and anticipated depository buildups or runoffs 
the company classifies the majority of its securities as available for sale  thereby maintaining significant liquidity 
the company s liquidity position is further enhanced by the structuring of a majority of its loan portfolio interest payments as monthly and also by the representation of residential mortgage loans in the company s loan portfolio

all of the financial instruments of the company as of december  were held for other than trading purposes 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s net interest income is dependent on the amounts of and yields on its interest earning assets as compared to the amounts of and rates on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is therefore sensitive to changes in market rates of interest 
the company s asset liability management strategy is to maximize net interest income while limiting exposure to risks associated to changes in interest rates 
this strategy is implemented by the company s ongoing analysis and management of its interest rate risk 
a principal function of asset liability management is to coordinate the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals and interest rate indices of the interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments are different  thus creating a risk that will result in disproportionate changes in the value of and the net earnings generated from the company s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through the company s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that generate favorable earnings while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
because the company s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  the company s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer maturity preferences in the market areas in which the company operates 
over the past few years  several hundred new bank branches have opened in the company s marketplace 
deposit pricing is competitive with frequent promotional rates paid by competitors 
ongoing competition for core and time deposits are driving up yields paid 
borrowings  which include fhlb advances  short term borrowings  and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms which  in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  reduce the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the rates  terms  and interest rate indices of the company s interest earning assets result primarily from the company s strategy of investing in securities and loans a substantial portion of which have adjustable rate terms 
this permits the company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread from the difference between the income earned on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
management uses a duration model for the bank s internal asset liability management 
the model uses cash flows and repricing information from loans and certificate of deposits  plus repricing assumptions on products without specific repricing dates eg  savings and interest bearing demand deposits  to calculate the durations of the bank s assets and liabilities 
securities are stress tested  and the theoretical changes in cash flow are key elements of the company s model 
the model also projects the effect on the company s earnings and theoretical value for a change in interest rates 
the model computes the duration of the bank s rate sensitive assets and liabilities  a theoretical market value of the bank s rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the effects of rate changes on the bank s earnings and market value 
the bank s exposure to interest rates is reviewed on a monthly basis by senior management and the company s board of directors 
effects of inflation inflation can have a significant effect on the operating results of all industries 
however  management believes that inflationary factors are not as critical to the banking industry as they are to other industries  due to the high concentration of relatively short duration monetary assets in the banking industry 
inflation does  however  have some impact on the company s growth  earnings  and total assets and on its need to closely monitor its equity capital levels 
management does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but it is difficult to assess the impact  since neither the timing nor the magnitude of the changes in the various inflation indices coincide with changes in interest rates 
inflation does impact the economic value of longer term  interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  but the company attempts to limit its long term assets and liabilities  as indicated in the tables set forth under financial condition and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company performs a net interest income analysis as part of its asset liability management practices 
net interest income analysis measures the change in net interest income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
this analysis assesses the risk of change in net interest income in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and and decreases in market interest rates 
the tables below present the company s projected changes in net interest income for the various rate shock levels at december  and  respectively 
change in net interest income over one year horizon guideline december  december  maximum dollar dollar change change change change change dollars in thousands bp bp bp bp  n a n a as shown above  at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would increase the company s net interest income by  or approximately  overall net interest income sensitivity remains within the company s and recommended regulatory guidelines 
as shown above  at december   the effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would increase the company s net interest income by  or approximately  overall net interest income sensitivity remains within the company s and recommended regulatory guidelines 
this decreased sensitivity was due to the changes in interest rates that affected various earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
due to the low level of interest rates at december   the company was not able to model an additional basis point decrease in rates 
the change in net interest income over the one year horizon from december  compared to december  can be attributed to the balance sheet repositioning the sale of lower yielding securities and the pre payment of higher rate fhlb advances  increases in loans which are primarily variable rate  and changes in core deposit pricing disciplines during the first nine months of the company has reduced rates paid on core deposits 
these changes more accurately reflect the company s current pricing strategy for core deposits and its planned actions in an environment of sharply changing rates 
interest bearing assets and liabilities are shocked and basis points instantaneously  except interest bearing core deposits  where they are modeled to increase basis points in a basis points shock and basis points in a basis point shock 
under a declining rate shock  they have a basis point floor 
core deposits are priced off various internal indices set by management 
management will adjust the indices accordingly  depending on rate movement and market conditions 
an analysis of core deposit pricing for the past four years indicates that  for a cumulative basis points increase in rates  the cumulative core deposit rate increases did not exceed basis points  except for the master money market rate which was then priced off the day us treasury bill rate 
the master money market was de coupled from the day us treasury bill rate and is now priced off an internal index 
the company offers special promotions to attract deposits as needed 
computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments  and deposit decay rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
actual values may differ from those projections set forth above  should market conditions vary from assumptions used in preparing the analyses 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
gap analysis is used to determine the repricing characteristics of the company s assets and liabilities 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities as of december   and provides the repricing dates of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of that date  as well as the company s interest rate sensitivity gap percentages for the periods presented 
over months months years years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets federal funds sold interest bearing due from banks securities loans total interest bearing assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits money markets savings deposits time deposits total interest bearing deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased fhlb advances junior subordinated debt note payable total borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative gap interest sensitivity gap to total assets cumulative sensitivity gap to total assets this chart shows that the company is mismatched at zero to three and four to months  that is  there were more liabilities repricing or maturing under these periods 
the gap position does not necessarily indicate the company s interest rate sensitivity or the impact to net interest income because interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are repricing off of different indices 
mortgage backed securities  including adjustable rate mortgage pools  are included in the above table based on their estimated weighted average lives obtained from outside analytical sources 
loans are included in the above table based on contractual maturity or contractual repricing dates 
computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay rates 
these computations should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
actual values may differ from those projections set forth above  should market conditions vary from assumptions used in preparing the analyses 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the gap analysis is based upon assumptions as to when assets and liabilities will reprice in a changing interest rate environment 
because such assumptions can be no more than estimates  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may  in fact  mature or reprice at different times and at different volumes than those estimated 
also  the renewal or repricing of certain assets and liabilities can be discretionary and subject to competitive and other pressures 
therefore  the gap table included above does not and cannot necessarily indicate the actual future impact of general interest rate movements on the company s net interest income
