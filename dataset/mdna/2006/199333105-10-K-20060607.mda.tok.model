item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
comments on the results of operations and financial condition below refer to our continuing operations  except in the section entitled discontinued operations 
executive overview we are a leading manufacturer and marketer of hoists  cranes  chain  conveyors  material handling systems  lift tables and component parts serving a wide variety of commercial and industrial end user markets 
our products are used to efficiently and ergonomically move  lift  position or secure objects and loads 
our products segment sells a wide variety of powered and manually operated wire rope and chain hoists  industrial crane systems  chain  hooks and attachments  actuators and rotary unions 
our solutions segment designs  manufactures  and installs application specific material handling systems and solutions for end users to improve workstation and facility wide work flow 
founded in  we have grown to our current leadership position through organic growth and also as the result of the businesses we acquired between february and april we have developed our leading market position over our year history by emphasizing technological innovation  manufacturing excellence and superior after sale service 
in addition  the acquisitions significantly broadened our product lines and services and expanded our geographic reach  end user markets and customer base 
integration of the operations of the acquired businesses with our previously existing businesses is substantially complete 
ongoing integration of these businesses includes improving our productivity  further reducing our excess manufacturing capacity and extending our sales activities to the european and asian marketplaces 
we are executing those initiatives through our lean manufacturing efforts  facility rationalization program  new product development and expanded sales activities 
shareholder value will be enhanced through continued emphasis on the improvement of the fundamentals including manufacturing efficiency  cost containment  efficient capital investment  market expansion and renewed customer focus 
we maintain a strong domestic market share with significant leading north american market positions in hoists  lifting and sling chain  and forged attachments 
to broaden our product offering in markets where we have a strong competitive position as well as to facilitate penetration into new geographic markets  we have heightened our new product development activities 
this includes development of hoist lines in accordance with international standards  to complement our current offering of hoist products designed in accordance with us standards 
to further expand our global sales  we are introducing certain of our products that historically have been distributed only in north america and also introducing new products through our existing european distribution network 
furthermore  we are working to build a distribution network in china to capture an anticipated growing demand for material handling products as that economy continues to industrialize 
these investments in international markets and new products are part of our focus on our greatest opportunities for growth 
international sales increased from approximately  to  during fiscal and overall sales increased over the same period last year 
management believes that the growth rate of total sales may moderate in future periods due to more difficult comparisons with our fiscal periods 
we monitor such indicators as us industrial capacity utilization  which has been increasing since july in addition  we continue to monitor the potential impact of global and domestic trends  including rising energy costs  steel price fluctuations  rising interest rates and uncertainty in some end user markets around the globe 
our lean manufacturing efforts are fundamentally changing our manufacturing processes to be more responsive to customer demand and improving on time delivery and productivity 
from to under our facility rationalization program  we closed facilities and consolidated several product lines 
during fiscal  certain families within our mechanical jack line were eliminated and several smaller sales offices were closed with potential opportunity for further rationalization 
we also continue to undergo assessments for possible divestiture of several less strategic businesses 
our manipulator and specialty marine chain businesses were sold in fiscal and two others remain as possible divestiture candidates  our conveyor business which comprises a majority of our solutions segment and a specialty crane business within our products segment 
during fiscal  we completed the sale and partial leaseback of warehouse in ontario  canada at a million gain as well as the sale of an unused parcel of land in charlotte  north carolina 
fiscal saw the completion of the sale of a chicago area property resulting in a million gain and the sale and partial leaseback of our corporate headquarters building in amherst  new york at a million gain  of which million was recorded in fiscal and the remainder is being recognized pro rata over the life of the year leaseback period 
additionally during  we sold a small parcel of land in virginia 
we will continue to sell surplus real estate resulting from our facility rationalization projects and those sales may result in gains or losses 
consistent with most companies  over the past several years we have been facing significantly increased costs for fringe benefits such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance and pension 
combined  those benefits cost us over million in fiscal and we work diligently to balance cost control with the need to provide competitive employee benefits packages for our associates 
another cost area of focus is steel 
we utilize approximately million to million of steel annually in a variety of forms including rod  wire  bar  structural and others 
with increases in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices  we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers 
we believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases 
we will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies 
results of operations net sales of our products and solutions segments  in millions of dollars and with percentage changes for each segment  were as follows change change fiscal years ended march  vs 
vs 
amount amount products segment solutions segment total net sales fiscal saw continued improvement in the industrial sector of north america and europe which began in fiscal compared to the downturn in the general north american and european economies and the industrial sectors in particular that had been occurring through fiscal in addition  sales growth was fostered by the expansion of international selling efforts 
net sales for fiscal of increased by million or from fiscal  and net sales for fiscal of million increased by million  or  from fiscal the products segment for fiscal experienced a net sales increase of over the prior year 
the increase was due to a combination of increased volume on the continued growth of the north american industrial economy as well as price increases million 
the products segment for fiscal experienced a net sales increase of over the prior year 
the increase was due to a combination of higher volume as the north american industrial economy recovered as well as price increases million including surcharges specifically in response to rising steel costs 
fiscal was impacted by the weakening us dollar relative to other currencies  particularly the euro  and reported products segment sales were favorably affected by million 
for fiscal  our solutions segment net sales were flat as increased volume was offset by the strengthening us dollar relative to the danish krone resulting in an unfavorable impact of million 
for fiscal  our solutions segment net sales increased as a result of increased volume in europe at our conveyor business 
gross profit of the products and solutions segments  in millions of dollars and as a percentage of total segment net sales  was as follows fiscal years ended march  amount amount amount products segment solutions segment total gross profit our gross profit margins were approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the products segment for fiscal and fiscal continues to see improved gross margins as a result of operational leverage at increased volumes from the prior years and the impact of previous facility rationalization projects and lean manufacturing activities 
the solutions segment s gross profit margins increased in fiscal as a result of a shift in product mix at our european conveyor business to more internally developed product costs from resale products  increased volume at certain facilities  and some rationalization cost savings 
the solutions segment s gross profit margins increased in fiscal as a result of the recovery of european markets which led to increased volume for one division  as well as the divestiture of a poor performing  non strategic business at the end of fiscal selling expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal increase includes additional salaries million  increased advertising  marketing  warehousing and travel million  and new market costs million offset by a decrease in foreign pension costs million and lower commission expense million 
fiscal includes a million increase resulting from the weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  particularly the euro  upon translation of foreign operating results into us dollars for reporting purposes 
fiscal also includes increases related to variable costs associated with the increase sales volume  mainly commissions million  increased foreign pension costs million and increased investments in international markets million 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal increase includes increases in salaries personnel including variable compensation million  employee development professional fees million  offset by lower foreign pension costs million  decreased external sarbanes oxley section savings million and currency translation million 
fiscal increases include variable compensation million  compliance costs associated with sarbanes oxley section implementation million  increasing foreign pension costs million  translation of foreign currencies into the weaker us dollar for reporting purposes million and increases in bad debt reserves based on increased accounts receivable levels million 
restructuring charges of million  million and million  or  and of net sales in fiscal  and  respectively  were primarily attributable to the ongoing organizational rationalizations occurring at the company 
the fiscal charges consist of the cost of removal of certain environmentally hazardous materials million  inventory disposal costs related to the rationalization of certain product families within our mechanical jack lines million  the ongoing maintenance costs of a non operating facility accrued based on anticipated sale date million and other facility rationalization projects million 
the fiscal restructuring charges consist of million of costs related to facility rationalizations being expensed on an as incurred basis as a result of the project timing being subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
fiscal also included million of write down on the net realizable value of a facility based on changes in market conditions and a reassessment of its net realizable value 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to various employee termination benefits and facility costs as a result of our continued closure  merging and reorganization and completion of two open projects from fiscal the remaining liability of as of march  relates to the accrued costs for the removal of the environmentally hazardous materials million and the ongoing maintenance costs of a non operating facility million 
write off amortization of intangibles was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
interest and debt expense was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  interest and debt expense was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal and decreases primarily resulted from lower debt levels as we continue to execute our strategy of debt reduction and increasing our financial flexibility 
other income and expense  net was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal includes million of redemption costs associated with the repurchase of outstanding senior secured and senior subordinated notes  offset by million from investment and interest income and million of gains from sales of real estate 
fiscal includes million in gains from sales of real estate  million from investment and interest income  offset by million of additional losses from business divestitures 
the income in fiscal included million from asset sales and million from an interest rate swap partially offset by million of losses upon business divestitures 
income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes were not reflective of u 
s statutory rates in fiscal  or a valuation allowance of million existed at march  due to the uncertainly of whether our us federal net operating loss carryforwards nols  deferred tax assets and capital loss carryforwards might ultimately be realized 
we utilized million of the us federal nols in fiscal reducing the valuation allowance by million 
as a result of our increased operating performance over the past several years  we reevaluated the certainty as to whether our remaining us federal nols and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized 
as a result of the determination that it is more likely than not that nearly all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized  million of the remaining valuation allowance was reversed as of march  the fiscal effective tax rate varies due to the benefit received from the utilization of the domestic net operating loss carry forwards that had fully reserved and jurisdictional mix 
income tax expense primarily results from non us taxable income and state taxes on non us taxable income 
the fiscal effective tax rate varies due to jurisdictional mix and the existence of losses at certain subsidiaries for which no benefit was recorded 
liquidity and capital resources in march  we amended and expanded our revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility currently provides availability up to a maximum of million with an opportunity for expansion up to million 
at march   the unused revolving credit facility totaled million  net of outstanding borrowings of million and outstanding letters of credit of million 
interest on the revolver is payable at varying eurodollar rates based on libor or prime plus a spread determined by our leverage ratio amounting to or basis points  respectively  at march  the revolving credit facility is secured by all domestic inventory  receivables  equipment  real property  subsidiary stock limited to for foreign subsidiaries and intellectual property 
in november  we registered an additional  shares of our common stock which were sold at per share 
the number of shares offered by us was  and  were offered by a selling shareholder 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholder 
this stock offering increased our weighted average common stock outstanding by million for the year ended march  a portion of the proceeds received by us were used to redeem million of senior secured notes notes 
the repurchase of the notes occurred at a premium resulting in a pre tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
as a result of the repurchase of the notes  million of pre tax deferred financing costs were written off 
the net effect of these items  a million pre tax loss in fiscal  is shown as part of other income and expense  net 
the balance of the proceeds is available for other general corporate purposes to advance our strategy of global growth  including additional debt repayment  investments and acquisitions 
in september  we issued million of senior subordinated notes notes due november  proceeds from the notes and cash on hand were used to repurchase all of the outstanding senior subordinated notes notes 
the repurchase of the notes occurred at a premium resulting in a pre tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
as a result of the repurchase of the notes  million of pre tax deferred financing costs and million of the original issue discount were written off 
the net effect of these items  a million pre tax loss in fiscal  is shown as part of other income and expense  net 
provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on indebtedness  asset sales  and dividends and other restricted payments 
until november   we may redeem up to of the outstanding notes at a redemption price of with the proceeds of equity offerings  subject to certain restrictions 
the notes are redeemable at the option of us  in whole or in part  at prices declining annually from the make whole price as defined in the notes agreement to on and after november  in the event of a change of control as defined in the indenture for such notes  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future domestic subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
in july  we issued million of senior secured notes due august  of which million remain outstanding at march  during april and may of  the company repurchased an additional million of the outstanding senior secured notes  resulting in a remaining balance of million 
the proceeds from the notes offering were used for the repayment in full of a then outstanding senior second secured term loan million  the repurchase of million of senior subordinated notes at a discount million  the repayment of a portion of the outstanding revolving credit facility million  the repayment of a portion of the term loan million  the payment of financing costs million and the payment of accrued interest million 
provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on liens  indebtedness  asset sales  and dividends and other restricted payments 
the notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at prices declining annually from the make whole price as defined in the indenture for the notes 
in the event of a change of control as defined  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof 
the notes are guaranteed by certain existing and future domestic subsidiaries and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
the notes are also secured  in a second lien position  by all domestic inventory  receivables  equipment  real property  subsidiary stock limited to for foreign subsidiaries and intellectual property 
the redemption in fiscal of the senior subordinated notes occurred at a discount resulting in a million pre tax gain on early extinguishment of debt 
as a result of the repayment of the senior second secured term loan and a portion of the term loan and senior subordinated notes  million of pre tax deferred financing costs were written off in fiscal the net effect of these two items  a million pre tax gain  is shown as part of other income and expense  net 
the corresponding credit agreement associated with the revolving credit facility places certain debt covenant restrictions on us  including certain financial requirements and a restriction on dividend payments  with which we were in compliance as of march  from time to time  we manage our debt portfolio by using interest rate swaps to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates 
in june  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  which matured in june that cash flow hedge was considered effective and the gain or loss on the change in fair value was reported in other comprehensive income  net of tax 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt libor plus basis points through august and million from august through august at the same rate 
that interest rate swap was considered an ineffective hedge and therefore the change in fair value was recognized in income as a gain 
the swap was terminated in january and a pre tax gain of million was recognized in fiscal as other income  net as a result of changes in the fair value of the swap 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flows  and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations and budgeted capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
this belief is dependent upon a steady economy and successful execution of our current business plan which includes cash generation for debt repayment 
the business plan focuses on continued implementation of lean manufacturing  possible facility rationalization projects  divestiture of excess facilities  improving working capital components  including inventory reductions  and new market and new product development 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the million increase in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to stronger operating performance in fiscal million and improved working capital components million 
the working capital changes come from favorable changes in inventory million  accounts payable and accrued liabilities million  offset by unfavorable changes in prepaids million and accounts receivables million 
the million decrease in fiscal relative to fiscal was primarily due to stronger operating performance in fiscal million offset by changes in working capital components million 
the working capital changes come from favorable changes in prepaids other million  accounts payable and accrued liabilities million  offset by unfavorable changes in and accounts receivables million and inventory million 
net cash used provided by investing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal change in cash used provided by investing activities is the result of increased capital expenditures and lower proceeds from asset sales 
the fiscal change in cash used provided by investing activities is primarily the result of increased capital expenditures 
the fiscal  and amounts included million  million and million  respectively  from business and property divestitures 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease for fiscal was the result of million of proceeds from the november stock offering and million from the exercise of employee stock options 
the fiscal  and amounts included million  million and million of debt repayment  respectively 
we also paid million and million of financing costs in fiscal and  respectively  to effect the capital transactions previously described 
contractual obligations the following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations in millions of dollars as of march   by period of estimated payments due fiscal fiscal fiscal more than total fiscal fiscal five years long term debt obligations a 
operating lease obligations b purchase obligations c interest obligations d letter of credit obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet under gaap e total a as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
b as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
c we have no purchase obligations specifying fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased 
we estimate that  at any given point in time  our open purchase orders to be executed in the normal course of business approximate million 
d estimated for our senior secured notes due and senior subordinated notes due e as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have no additional off balance sheet obligations that are not reflected above 
capital expenditures in addition to keeping our current equipment and plants properly maintained  we are committed to replacing  enhancing and upgrading our property  plant and equipment to support new product development  reduce production costs  increase flexibility to respond effectively to market fluctuations and changes  meet environmental requirements  enhance safety and promote ergonomically correct work stations 
further  our facility rationalization program underway between fiscal reduced our annual capital expenditure requirements and also provided for transfers of equipment from the rationalized facilities to other operating facilities 
our capital expenditures for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
higher capital expenditures in fiscal and were the result of new product development and productivity enhancing equipment along with normal maintenance items 
we expect capital expenditure spending in fiscal to be in the range of million 
inflation and other market conditions our costs are affected by inflation in the us economy and  to a lesser extent  in foreign economies including those of europe  canada  mexico and the pacific rim 
we do not believe that general inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations over the periods presented primarily due to overall low inflation levels over such periods and our ability to generally pass on rising costs through annual price increases and surcharges 
however  employee benefits costs such as health insurance  workers compensation insurance  pensions as well as energy and business insurance have exceeded general inflation levels 
in the future  we may be further affected by inflation that we may not be able to pass on as price increases 
with changes in worldwide demand for steel and fluctuating scrap steel prices over the past several years  we experienced fluctuations in our costs that we have reflected as price increases and surcharges to our customers 
we believe we have been successful in instituting surcharges and price increases to pass on these material cost increases 
we will continue to monitor our costs and reevaluate our pricing policies 
seasonality and quarterly results our quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of large customer orders  periods of high vacation and holiday concentrations  restructuring charges and other costs attributable to our facility rationalization program  divestitures  acquisitions and the magnitude of rationalization integration costs 
therefore  our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for the full fiscal year 
discontinued operations in may  we completed the divestiture of substantially all of the assets of asi which comprised the principal business unit in our former solutions automotive segment 
proceeds from this sale included cash of million and an subordinated note in the principal amount of million payable over years 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the financial viability of the new organization  the note has been recorded at the estimated net realizable value of principal payments received on the note are recorded as income from discontinued operations at the time of receipt 
accordingly  million of income from discontinued operations was recorded in fiscal all interest and principal payments required under the note have been made to date 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continually evaluate the estimates and their underlying assumptions  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates 
we have identified below the accounting policies involving estimates that are critical to our financial statements 
other accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
the determination of the obligations and expense for pension and postretirement benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions that are used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are disclosed in notes and  respectively  to our fiscal consolidated financial statements and include the discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of future increases in compensation and healthcare costs 
the pension discount rate assumptions of   as of march   and  respectively  are based on long term bond rates 
the decrease in discount rates for fiscal and resulted in million and million increases in the projected benefit obligations as of march  and  respectively 
the rate of return on plan assets assumptions of  and for the years ended march   and  respectively  are based on the composition of the asset portfolios approximately equities and fixed income at march  and their long term historical returns 
the actual assets realized gains of and million in fiscal and our funded status as of march  and was negative by million and million  or and  respectively 
our pension contributions during fiscal and were approximately and million  respectively 
the negative funded status may result in future pension expense increases 
pension expense for the march  fiscal year is expected to approximate million  which is up from the fiscal amount of million 
the factors outlined above will result in increases in funding requirements over time  unless there is continued significant market appreciation in the asset values 
however  pension funding contributions for the march  fiscal year are expected to decrease by approximately million compared to fiscal the compensation increase assumption of as of march   and is based on historical trends 
the healthcare inflation assumptions of  and for fiscal  and  respectively are based on anticipated trends 
healthcare costs in the united states have increased substantially over the last several years 
if this trend continues  the cost of postretirement healthcare will increase in future years 
insurance reserves 
our accrued general and product liability reserves as described in note to our consolidated financial statements involve actuarial techniques including the methods selected to estimate ultimate claims  and assumptions including emergence patterns  payment patterns  initial expected losses and increased limit factors 
other insurance reserves such as workers compensation and group health insurance are based on actual historical and current claim data provided by third party administrators or internally maintained 
inventory and accounts receivable reserves 
slow moving and obsolete inventory reserves are judgmentally determined based on historical and expected future usage within a reasonable timeframe 
we reassess trends and usage on a regular basis and if we identify changes  we revise our estimated allowances 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memo reserves are also judgmentally determined based on historical bad debt write offs and credit memos issued  assessing potentially uncollectible customer accounts and analyzing the accounts receivable agings 
long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment and certain intangibles are depreciated or amortized over their assigned lives 
these assets as well as goodwill are also periodically measured for impairment 
the assigned lives and the projected cash flows used to test impairment are subjective 
if actual lives are shorter than anticipated or if future cash flows are less than anticipated  we could incur a future impairment charge or a loss on disposal relating to these assets 
marketable securities 
on a quarterly basis  we review our marketable securities for declines in market value that may be considered other than temporary 
we consider market value declines to be other than temporary if they are declines for a period longer than six months and in excess of of original cost 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
as of march   we had million of total net deferred tax assets before valuation allowances 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  million of the assets pertain to us federal net operating loss carryforwards nols and the remainder relate principally to liabilities including employee benefit plans  insurance reserves  accrued vacation and incentive costs and also to asset valuation reserves such as inventory obsolescence reserves and bad debt reserves 
the us federal nols expire in we reduced the deferred tax assets by million as a result of utilizing us federal nols in fiscal as a result of our increased operating performance over the past several years  we reevaluated the certainty as to whether our remaining nols and other deferred tax assets may ultimately be realized 
as a result of the determination that it is more likely than not that nearly all of the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized  a significant portion of the remaining valuation allowance was reversed in fiscal our ability to realize our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
if we do not generate sufficient taxable income  we could be required to record a valuation allowance 
revenue recognition 
sales are recorded when title passes to the customer  which is generally at the time of shipment to the customer  except for long term construction type contracts 
for long term construction type contracts  we recognize contract revenues under the percentage of completion method  measured by comparing direct costs incurred to total estimated direct costs 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
in the event that a loss is anticipated on an uncompleted contract  a provision for the estimated loss is made at the time it is determined 
billings on contracts may precede or lag revenues earned  and such differences are reported in the balance sheet as current liabilities accrued liabilities and current assets unbilled revenues  respectively 
customers do not routinely return product 
however  sales returns are permitted in specific situations and typically include a restocking charge or the purchase of additional product 
we have established an allowance for returns based upon historical trends 
effects of new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  as an amendment to arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage 
this statement requires that these items be recognized as current period charges and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
this statement becomes effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in statement r is similar to the approach described in statement however  statement r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
statement r was to be adopted for interim or annual periods beginning after june  on april th   the sec announced that it would provide for a phased in implementation process for fasb statement no 
r 
the sec is requiring that registrants adopt statement r s fair value method of accounting for share based payments to employees no later than the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after june  we expect to adopt r in the first quarter of fiscal statement r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payments granted to employees prior to the effective date of statement r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on amounts previously recognized under statement for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we are still evaluating the method we plan to use when we adopt statement r 
as permitted by statement  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  adoption of statement r s fair value method will have an impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
this statement becomes effective for changes in accounting methods during fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
we are exposed to various market risks  including commodity prices for raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we may enter into financial instrument transactions  which attempt to manage and reduce the impact of such changes 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our primary commodity risk is related to changes in the price of steel 
we control this risk through negotiating purchase contracts on a consolidated basis and by attempting to build changes in raw material costs into the selling prices of our products 
we also evaluate our steel cost increases and assess the need for price increases and surcharges to our customers 
we have not entered into financial instrument transactions related to raw material costs 
in fiscal  of our net sales were from manufacturing plants and sales offices in foreign jurisdictions 
we manufacture our products in the united states  mexico  china  denmark  the united kingdom  france and germany and sell our products and solutions in over countries 
our results of operations could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our operating results are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the canadian dollar  european currencies and the mexican peso 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar  the value of our net sales and net income denominated in canadian dollars decreases when translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated results 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to purchases denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk is mitigated since the majority of our foreign operations net sales and the related expense transactions are denominated in the same currency so therefore a significant change in foreign exchange rates would likely have a very minor impact on net income 
for example  a decline in the rate of exchange between the euro and the us dollar impacts net income by approximately million 
in addition  the majority of our export sale transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we currently have not invested in derivative instruments  such as foreign exchange contracts  to hedge foreign currency transactions 
we control risk related to changes in interest rates by structuring our debt instruments with a combination of fixed and variable interest rates and by periodically entering into financial instrument transactions as appropriate 
at march   we do not have any material swap agreements or similar financial instruments in place 
at march  and  approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates 
at those dates  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of outstanding variable rate debt 
a fluctuation in interest rates in fiscal and would have changed interest expense on that outstanding variable rate debt by approximately million for both years 
like many industrial manufacturers  we are involved in asbestos related litigation 
in continually evaluating costs relating to its estimated asbestos related liability  we review  among other things  the incidence of past and recent claims  the historical case dismissal rate  the mix of the claimed illnesses and occupations of the plaintiffs  its recent and historical resolution of the cases  the number of cases pending against it  the status and results of broad based settlement discussions  and the number of years such activity might continue 
based on this review  we have estimated its share of liability to defend and resolve probable asbestos related personal injury claims 
this estimate is highly uncertain due to the limitations of the available data and the difficulty of forecasting with any certainty the numerous variables that can affect the range of the liability 
we will continue to study the variables in light of additional information in order to identify trends that may become evident and to assess their impact on the range of liability that is probable and estimable 
based on actuarial information  we have estimated our asbestos related aggregate liability through march  and march  to range between million and million using actuarial parameters of continued claims for a period of to years 
our estimation of our asbestos related aggregate liability that is probable and estimable  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  is through march  and ranges from million to million as of march  the range of probable and estimable liability reflects uncertainty in the number of future claims that will be filed and the cost to resolve those claims  which may be influenced by a number of factors  including the outcome of the ongoing broad based settlement negotiations  defensive strategies  and the cost to resolve claims outside the broad based settlement program 
based on the underlying actuarial information  we have reflected million as a liability in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the increase in the recorded liability from the amount of million at march  is due to a change in actuarial parameters used to calculate required asbestos liability reserve levels 
the recorded liability does not consider the impact of any potential favorable federal legislation such as the fair act 
of this amount  management expects to incur asbestos liability payments of approximately million over the next months 
because payment of the liability is likely to extend over many years  management believes that the potential additional costs for claims will not have a material after tax effect on our financial condition or our liquidity  although the net after tax effect of any future liabilities recorded could be material to earnings in a future period
