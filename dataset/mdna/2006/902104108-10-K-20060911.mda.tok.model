actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including risk factors described in the risk factors set forth in this item a  which are incorporated herein by reference 
overview the company generates revenues  earnings and cash flows from developing  manufacturing and marketing high technology materials and derivative products for precision use in industrial  medical  military  security and aerospace applications 
we also generate revenue  earnings and cash flows from external customer and government funded research and development contracts relating to the development and manufacture of new technologies  materials and products 
our customer base includes oem  laser end users  system integrators of high power lasers  manufacturers of equipment and devices for industrial  security and monitoring  x ray imaging  us government prime contractors  various us government agencies and thermoelectric solutions 
approximately of our revenues during the fiscal year ended june  were from product sales to customers outside the united states 
the following discussion and analysis includes the seven months financial results for the year ended june  of the company s marlow industries  inc subsidiary included in the compound semiconductor group since the date of acquisition 
all per share data for this year and former periods cited in this discussion and analysis have been adjusted to reflect the two for one split of the company s common shares paid as a stock dividend to shareholders of record on march  and distributed on march  critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations requires the company s management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes the company s critical accounting estimates are those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  warranty reserves  inventory valuation  valuation of long lived assets including acquired intangibles and goodwill  accrual of bonus and profit sharing estimates  accrual of income tax liability estimates  accounting for share based compensation and self insurance for workers compensation 
management believes these estimates to be critical because they are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact to the financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is established or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue for all business segments  other than for contract research and development  is recognized from the sale of products at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
the company considers the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab  which superseded sab the company performs research and development under contract agreements with customers based on cost plus fixed fee  cost reimbursable or fixed fee terms 
these contracts generally require the company to produce and provide developmental materials and or products to those customers 
revenues from cost plus fixed fee and cost reimbursable contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
the company follows the guidelines of statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts for our fixed fee contracts 
revenue and profits on each fixed fee contract are accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting  whereby revenue and profits are recognized throughout the performance period of the contract 
percentage of completion is determined by relating the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
the estimated total cost for each contract is periodically reevaluated and revised  when necessary  throughout the life of the contract 
losses on contracts are recorded in full when identified 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts and a warranty reserve based on historical experience and believes the collection of revenues  net of these reserves  is reasonably assured 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate for potential non collection of accounts receivable based on historical experience 
the company has not experienced a non collection of accounts receivable materially affecting its financial position or results of operations as of and for the fiscal years ended june   and if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate causing an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for bad debts may be required in future periods 
the company records a warranty reserve as a charge against earnings based on a percentage of revenues utilizing actual returns over the last twelve months 
if actual returns in the future are not consistent with the historical data used to calculate these estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required 
the company records a slow moving inventory reserve as a charge against earnings for all products on hand more than twelve months to eighteen months depending on the products that have not been sold to customers or cannot be further manufactured for sale to alternative customers 
an additional reserve is recorded for product on hand that is in excess of product sold to customers over the same periods noted above 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than projected  additional inventory reserves may be required 
the company tests goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the determination of related estimated useful lives of other intangible assets and whether goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles are impaired involves judgments based upon long term projections of future performance 
estimates of fair value are based on our projection of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows of each reporting unit considering historical and anticipated results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
the valuations may employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors 
the annual goodwill impairment analysis considers the financial projections of the reporting unit based on the most recently completed budgeting and long term strategic planning processes and also considers the current financial performance compared to the prior projections of the reporting unit 
changes in our financial performance  judgments and projections could result in an impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
as a result of the purchase price allocations from our prior acquisitions and due to our decentralized structure  our goodwill is included in multiple reporting units 
due to the cyclical nature of our business  and the other factors described under risk factors herein  the profitability of our individual reporting units may periodically suffer from downturns in customer demands  operational challenges and other factors 
these factors may have a relatively more pronounced impact on the individual reporting units as compared to the company as a whole and might adversely affect the fair value of the reporting units 
if material adverse conditions occur that impact our reporting units  our future determination of fair value may not support the carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units  and the related goodwill would need to be written down 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal after completing the company s annual goodwill impairment analysis  it was determined that the goodwill of our military infrared optics business unit was impaired and consequently the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
the company records certain bonus and profit sharing estimates as a charge against earnings based on a formula percentage of the company s operating income 
these estimates are adjusted to actual based on final results of operations achieved during the fiscal year 
certain partial bonus amounts are paid quarterly based on interim company performance  and the remainder is paid after fiscal year end and final determination of the applicable percentage 
other bonuses are paid annually 
the company records an estimated income tax liability to recognize the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or income tax returns 
judgment is required in estimating the future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or the income tax returns

prior to july   the company followed accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for its share based compensation 
the company elected the modified retrospective transition method for adopting sfas r 
under this method  all prior period financial statements were restated effective july  to recognize share based compensation cost in the amounts previously reported in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated balance sheet at june  has been restated for the modified retrospective adoption of sfas r resulting in a million increase in common stock  a million reduction in retained earnings and a million increase in deferred tax assets 
under the provisions of sfas r  the company recorded million  million and million in share based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
the shared based compensation expense is allocated to cost of goods sold and to selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of earnings based upon the employee classification of the grantee 
the company utilized the black scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value of the share based compensation expense 
during the fiscal years ended june   and  the weighted average fair value of options granted under the stock option plan was  and  respectively  per option using the following assumptions year ended june  year ended june  year ended june  risk free interest rate expected volatility expected life of options years years years dividend yield none none none the risk free interest rate is derived from the average us treasury note rate during the period  which approximates the rate in effect at the time of grant related to the expected life of the options 
the risk free interest rate shown above is the weighted average rate for all options granted during the fiscal year 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company s common stock over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options 
the expected life calculation is based on the observed time to post vesting exercise and or forfeitures of options by our employees 
the dividend yield of zero is based on the fact the company has never paid cash dividends and has no intention to pay cash dividends in the future 
the estimated annualized forfeitures are based on the company s historical experience of option pre vesting cancellations and are estimated at a rate of 
under the provisions of sfas r  the company will record additional expense in future periods if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than estimated  and will record a recovery of expense in future periods if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
the company is self insured for certain losses related to workers compensation 
additionally  third party insurance is obtained to limit our exposure to these claims in excess of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate per policy year 
when estimating the self insurance liability  the company considers a number of factors  including historical claims experience  demographic and severity factors and valuations provided by independent third party consultants 
periodically  management reviews its assumptions and the valuations to determine the adequacy of the self insurance liability
