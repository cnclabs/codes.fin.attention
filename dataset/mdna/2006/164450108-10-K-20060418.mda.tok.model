except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements even though our situation may change in the future 
business we are a designer and manufacturer of power supplies for oems 
our advanced power supply products are typically custom designed into mid to high end commercial applications in the computing and storage  wireless infrastructure  enterprise networking  medical and industrial markets 
we operate worldwide and have facilities in orange county  california  bombay  india  guadalajara  mexico  wavre  belgium europe and shanghai  china 
we were founded in in orange county  california 
as we expanded our business and customer base  we opened facilities in bombay  india  in guadalajara  mexico  and shanghai  china 
in june  we acquired cherokee europe  which added a manufacturing facility in wavre  belgium to our manufacturing capacity and enabled us to better serve the european market 
we generate a significant portion of our sales from oems in the communications and computing market segment 
our operating results and financial condition continue to be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions and reduced capital spending by the communication service providers that purchase our customers products 
these conditions have caused our revenues to soften in in addition  gross margins in reflect  among other things  a shift in our sales mix during that period  to programs with products with relatively higher material cost 
basis of reporting net sales net sales consist of sales during the period presented  net of returns 
revenue is recognized from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
cost of sales the principal elements comprising cost of sales are raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
raw materials account for a large majority of our costs of sales 
raw materials include magnetic sub assemblies  sheet metal  electronic and other components  mechanical parts and electrical wires 
direct labor costs include costs of hourly employees 
manufacturing overhead includes salaries  and the direct expense and allocation of costs attributable to manufacturing for lease costs  depreciation on property  plant and equipment  utilities  property taxes and repairs and maintenance 
operating expenses operating expenses include engineering costs  selling and marketing costs and general and administrative expenses 
engineering costs primarily include salaries and benefits of engineering personnel  safety approval and quality certification fees  and depreciation on equipment and subcontract costs for third party contracting services 
selling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and benefits to account managers and commissions to independent sales representatives 
administrative expenses primarily include salaries and benefits for certain management and administrative personnel  professional fees and information system costs 
operating expenses also include the direct expense and allocation of costs attributable to these departments for lease costs  depreciation on property  plant and equipment  utilities  property taxes and repairs and maintenance 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information currently available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our reported amounts of revenue  expenses  assets and liabilities 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
we also offer our customers the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for warranty based on historical experience  which has been insignificant to our financial condition and results of operations 
any significant increase in product failure rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period or periods in which those returns materialize 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we might not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant portion of our accounts receivable are concentrated in a small number of customers 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable  our liquidity and our future operating results 
during and  our top ten customers accounted for approximately and of our accounts receivables  respectively  and and of our net sales  respectively 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory and the current estimated market value of the inventory using the weighted average cost method 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our historical usage data and estimates of future demand 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
as demonstrated during the past five years  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize additional expense in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time such inventory is sold 
therefore  although we make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a material effect on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
deferred taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if our future taxable income is significantly higher than expected and or we are able to utilize our tax credits  we may be required to reverse all or a significant part of our valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets which could substantially reduce our effective tax rate for such period 
therefore  any significant changes in statutory tax rates or the amount of our valuation allowance could have a material effect on the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and our reported financial results 
goodwill and long lived assets we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that an impairment of goodwill has possibly occurred 
the determination of whether any potential impairment of goodwill exists is based upon a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to the accounting value of its net assets 
we also review the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined based upon the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows from the operations to which the assets relate  utilizing our best estimates  appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 
these projected future cash flows may vary significantly over time as a result of increased competition  changes in technology  fluctuations in demand  consolidation of our customers and reductions in average selling prices 
if the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset would be deemed impaired and an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair market value of the asset 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from our statements of operations as a percentage of our net sales for the periods indicated net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating income interest expense other income  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales decreased by approximately or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the reduction in demand for products from a few of our larger programs in the telecom and datacom market segments 
the majority of the decline in sales was related to the net decrease in sales to some of our largest customers in revenues generated from shipments to our top ten customers declined by million  including a million decrease in sales to one of our largest customers  from these decreases have occurred as revenues from older programs decline and are replaced by growing revenues from new programs over time 
also contributing to the decrease from were the effects of material shortages and the transition of certain customer programs to consignment hub arrangements 
revenue recognition on shipments to the consignment hubs is delayed until the customer pulls the product from the hub for their production requirements 
a slightly stronger euro in offset the revenue decrease by approximately million 
gross profit gross profit decreased by approximately or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  decreased to from in the prior year 
the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to the decrease in revenues and the resulting loss of contribution margin on those revenues  combined with a different product mix during that included programs with higher material contents than the prior year 
the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to higher labor and overhead costs as a percentage of net sales resulting from the lower revenue level  combined with the change in product mix 
operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the million insurance proceeds received in  to compensate us for the replacement value of the belgium  europe assets destroyed in the fire 
the total recoveries of million resulted in a million gain reported in the year ending december  as of december  the company has been reimbursed for the values of the damaged property 
operating expenses related to general and administrative salaries  benefits  professional fees and expenses were higher in compared to due to costs associated with being a public company and the readiness efforts for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  even though the company was not required to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act in because of market cap 
the company anticipates being compliant with all sections of the legislation when it is required 
in addition  we recognized million operating expenses in related to our new shanghai  china facility 
stock compensation expense there was no stock compensation expense for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  in  we recorded stock compensation expense of million primarily in connection with the retirement of our former chairman of the board  and the acceleration of the vesting of his unvested options 
as described previously in item  legal proceedings  he was awarded additional stock compensation as a result of an arbitration proceeding  however  the cost of the award  including legal expenses  was paid by an unrelated third party and not by cherokee 
as a result no additional stock charge was recognized on our books 
operating income as a result of the factors discussed above  operating income decreased by  or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating margin decreased to from in the prior year 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in interest expense was due to the repayment of debt and conversion to equity of our senior convertible notes in connection with our initial public offering 
other income  net other income  net  for the year ended december  was income of million compared to income of million for the year ended december  income taxes the provision for income taxes for the year ended december  decreased by million to 
million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in the provision for income taxes from was due largely to the decrease in income loss before income taxes  we incurred a loss before income taxes this year compared to income at december  the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets for the year ended december  increased by million to million  compared to million for the year ended december  provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended december  and was calculated separately by each tax jurisdictions within the related country of business 
in spite of the company s overall loss for the year  some of our divisions generated income for the year 
for  one of the division s income was offset with net operating losses nol s that carried forward 
the other divisions had no nol s to offset their income for the year  therefore  taxes were applied 
the company s new operation in shanghai  china is not subject to taxes for two years from the first profit making year due to an applicable tax holiday 
see further discussion of the income tax provision and net operating loss carry forwards in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net income loss as a result of the factors discussed above  we recorded net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased by approximately or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume to a broad base of customers in the datacom  telecom and industrial end markets  due to economic improvements in the end markets in which they operate 
our sales increase included sales from several new customers 
sales to three new customers accounted for million of the increase in sales during a favorable foreign currency exchange rate effect of million due to a stronger euro also contributed to the net increase in sales 
gross profit gross profit increased by or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  increased to from in the prior year 
of the million increase in gross profit  million was attributable to higher sales volume and the remaining portion was attributable to increased gross margin 
the increase in gross margin was due primarily to a reduction in direct labor and factory overhead costs as a percentage of sales of and  respectively  and was partially offset by a increase in material cost as a percentage of sales 
for the year ended december   direct labor and factory overhead costs as a percentage of sales at cherokee europe improved significantly  reflecting increased efficiencies due to higher production volumes  as well as a lower manufacturing cost structure resulting from the restructuring plan implemented in june  as described below 
these decreases in direct labor and overhead costs as a percentage of sales were partially offset by an increase in material costs as a percentage of sales in both europe and north america  resulting from a change in product mix primarily during the second half of this mix included programs with higher material contents than the prior year  as well as increased revenues from new programs  which typically have higher material and labor costs in the early stages of production 
operating expenses operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million or  to million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of sales  operating expenses decreased significantly to from in the prior year 
the net decrease in operating expenses of million was primarily due to one time cherokee europe restructuring costs of million recorded in june described below and a decrease in stock compensation expense of million 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in engineering and development  selling and marketing  and general and administrative expenses of million  million and million  respectively 
these increased expenses were incurred primarily to support the significantly higher sales volume and related business activities compared to a year ago  as well as the additional expenses associated with being a public company 
of these increases  approximately million was attributable to a stronger euro versus the year ended december   million was attributable to higher sales commissions  million was attributable to increased insurance costs primarily for directors and officers liability  and million was attributable to professional fees and public company expenses 
increases in payroll and related costs were substantially offset by decreases in incentive compensation in restructuring costs during  we implemented a restructuring plan involving the elimination of a number of operational and administrative positions at the cherokee europe facility in belgium due to unfavorable economic conditions in that market 
pursuant to the restructuring plan  we recorded a one time termination benefit charge of million for the year ended december  stock compensation expense stock compensation expense for the year ended december  decreased million or  to million from million for the year ended december  in  we recorded stock compensation expense of million primarily in connection with the retirement of our former chairman of the board  and the acceleration of the vesting of his unvested options 
in  we issued  shares of common stock to management for services rendered 
in addition  we issued  shares of common stock to the management of cherokee europe for achieving specified financial performance targets during the second half of  and shares related to the achievement of these performance targets were issued in as a result  we recorded stock compensation in the year ended december  of million  which represented the estimated fair value of these shares as of the historical or proposed issuance date 
operating income as a result of the factors discussed above  operating income increased by approximately or million  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating margin increased to from in the prior year 
operating income for the year ended december  included the effect of the cherokee europe restructuring costs of million and stock compensation expense of million 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in interest expense was due to the repayment of million of certain outstanding indebtedness and accrued interest  and the conversion to equity of our senior convertible notes  in connection with our initial public offering in february other income  net other income  net for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  other income  net for the year ended december  included a gain on the sale of land of million and foreign currency exchange gains of million 
income taxes provision for income taxes for the year ended december  increased by million to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in the provision for income taxes from was due largely to shifts in the geographical mix of income for and reflects taxable income in belgium  as we no longer had net operating losses available in belgium in income generated in the united states during was fully offset by the utilization of deferred tax assets 
see further discussion of the income tax provision and nol s carry forwards in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  of million was primarily due to an accrual for an estimated tax liability relating to an audit assessment by the india tax authorities for previous years 
net income loss as a result of the factors discussed above  we recorded net income of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we expect our liquidity requirements will be primarily for working capital and capital expenditures 
we have historically financed our capital needs with cash from operations supplemented by borrowings from credit facilities and debt issuances 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  and borrowing base availability of million under our existing revolving credit facility 
in addition  cherokee europe maintains a working capital line of credit of approximately million with a belgian bank  bbl  which is denominated in euros  is collateralized by a pledge in first and second rank over a specific amount of business assets  which requires cherokee europe to maintain a certain specific minimum solvency ratio and is cancelable at any time 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings 
we believe these amounts  together with cash flow from operations  are sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we completed our initial public offering of  shares of our common stock on february  the net proceeds from the offering were million 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness  including certain term loans  our old revolving credit facility  our second lien notes  related interest on these obligations  as well as accrued interest and interest added to the principal amount of our senior convertible notes 
for the twelve months ended december  we had a remaining balance of million 
during the twelve months ended december  we invested million into the development of our new china facility  and million was used in operating expenses and loss for the year 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  and for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
this decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a lower operating income compared to the twelve months ended december   due to lower revenues for the year 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  and million  respectively 
in  the company used more cash in investing in higher purchases of short term investments  and the construction at cherokee europe related to the portion of the building destroyed by fire in the company was fully insured at the replacement value for the destroyed items  subject to a  deductible 
see additional disclosure in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  and million in in february  we completed our initial public offering  which generated net proceeds  after debt repayment and expenses  of approximately million 
capital expenditures for the year ended december   were million  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary increase in capital expenditures for the year ended december  was largely due to our capital investment related to the development of our new china facility 
contractual obligations as of december   our borrowings consisted of approximately million of senior notes bearing interest at annually  and no borrowings under the credit facility 
we are required to make semi annual interest payments to holders of the senior notes 
we have operating lease obligations relating to our facilities in tustin and irvine  california  bombay  india  and shanghai  china 
we have purchase commitments primarily with vendors and suppliers for the purchase of inventory  and for other goods  services  and equipment as part of the normal course of business 
these commitments are generally evidenced by purchase orders that may or may not include cancellation provisions 
based on current expectations  we do not believe that any cancellation penalties we incur under these obligations would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
the maturities of our long term debt  including capital leases  and future payments relating to our operating leases and other obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt operating leases purchase order commitments europe restructuring europe restructuring long service award deferred compensation total long term debt includes our senior notes  which mature on november  interest on the senior notes is payable in cash on may and november of each year 
the senior notes are secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of our domestic assets and by a pledge of of the equity of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
in connection with our initial public offering  we amended our existing senior revolving credit facility with general electric capital corporation the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million  subject to a borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivables and inventory  which was million at december  we plan to use funds available under the credit facility to finance working capital and other cash requirements as needed 
the credit facility matures in august and bears interest  at our option  at a rate per annum equal to libor plus or the agent bank s base rate plus 
in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal  we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the credit facility in respect of the average daily balance of the unused loan commitment at a rate of per annum 
the credit facility is our senior obligation and ranks equal in right of payment with our existing and future permitted senior debt including our senior notes  and senior in right of payment to our future permitted subordinated debt

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and short term interest rates 
we did not have any derivative financial instruments at december  we had no variable rate debt outstanding at december  however  any debt we incur under the credit facility and cherokee europe line of credit with bbl will bear interest at a variable rate 
we cannot predict market fluctuations in interest rates and their impact on any variable rate debt we may incur in the future  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate long term debt will be available to us at favorable rates  if at all 
the functional currency for our european operations is the euro 
we are  therefore  subject to a certain degree of market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk is mitigated by the fact that our revenues and expenses are generally both transacted in euros  thereby reducing the risk of foreign currency fluctuation on our european operations 
the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results as of and for the year ended december   was not material 
historically  we have not actively engaged in exchange rate hedging activities
