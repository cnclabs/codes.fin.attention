risk factors the company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results  and many of those risks are driven by factors that the company cannot control or predict 
the following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant  although there may be other risks that could arise  or may prove to be more significant than expected  that may affect the company s operations or financial results 
for a discussion of the company s risk management  including technology and operating risk and legal and regulatory risk  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management 
there has been aggressive price competition in the company s industry  which may continue in the future 
the company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjusts commission rates  interest rates  and other fee structures to enhance its competitive position 
increased competition  including pricing pressure  could harm the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the industry in which the company competes has recently undergone a period of consolidation and the company now faces stronger competitors 
the company faces intense competition for the clients that it serves and the products and services it offers 
there has recently been significant consolidation as financial institutions with which the company competes have been acquired by or merged 
table of contents the charles schwab corporation into or acquired other firms 
this consolidation may continue 
competition is based on many factors  including the range of products and services offered  pricing  customer service  brand recognition  reputation  and perceived financial strength 
consolidations may enable other firms to offer a broader range of products and services than the company does  or offer such products at more competitive prices 
the company faces intense competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees  especially for employees who are key to the company s ability to build and enhance client relationships 
the market for quality professionals and other personnel in the company s business is highly competitive 
competition is particularly strong for financial consultants who build and sustain the company s client relationships 
the company s ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs 
extensive regulation of the company s businesses limits the company s activities and may subject it to significant penalties 
as a participant in the securities and financial services industries  the company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies  supervisory authorities  and sros 
such regulation continues to become more extensive and complex 
the requirements imposed by the company s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect clients 
these regulations often serve to limit the company s activities by way of net capital  customer protection and market conduct requirements  and restrictions on the businesses in which the company may operate 
despite the company s efforts to comply with applicable regulations  there are a number of risks  particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear or where regulators revise their previous guidance 
any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the company s regulators could result in fines  penalties  cease and desist orders  enforcement actions  or suspension or expulsion of an affiliate  its officers  or employees  any of which could harm the company s reputation and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is subject to litigation and may not always be successful in defending itself against such claims 
the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business  which can result in settlements and awards 
it is inherently difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages  and a substantial judgment  settlement  fine  or penalty could be material to the company s operating results for a particular future period  depending on the company s results for that period 
changes in legislation  rules  and regulations could negatively impact the company s business and financial results 
new legislation  rule changes  or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal  state and sro rules and regulations may directly affect the operation and profitability of the company 
the profitability of the company could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally  including changes to the laws governing taxation  electronic commerce  and security of client data 
a significant decrease in the company s liquidity could negatively affect the company s business as well as reduce client confidence in the company 
maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the company  including margin lending  mortgage lending  and transaction settlement  among other liquidity needs 
a reduction in the company s liquidity position could also reduce client confidence in the company  which could result in the loss of client accounts 
in addition  if the company s broker dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines  regulators could limit the company s operations and its ability to repay debt  pay cash dividends  and repurchase shares of its stock 
in particular  any such limitations could have an adverse effect on csc  which depends primarily on cash generated by its subsidiaries in order to fulfill its debt service obligations and otherwise meet its liquidity needs 
the company attempts to manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient liquid financial resources to fund its balance sheet and meet its obligations 
the company s liquidity needs are met primarily through cash generated by operations  as well as cash provided by external financing 
risks in meeting these needs may arise with fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances  as well as changes in market conditions 

table of contents the charles schwab corporation specific risk factors which may adversely affect the company s liquidity position include a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts which may affect the amount of the company s liquid assets  a significant downgrade in the company s credit ratings which could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets  and a dramatic increase in the company s client lending activities including margin  mortgage  and personal lending which may reduce the company s liquid resources and excess capital position 
technology and operational failures could subject the company to losses  litigation  and regulatory actions 
the company faces technology and operating risk which is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems of the company or its outsourced service providers that constrain the company s ability to gather  process  and communicate information efficiently and securely  without interruptions 
this risk also includes the risk of human error  employee misconduct  external fraud  computer viruses  terrorist attacks  and natural disaster 
the company s business and operations could be negatively impacted by any significant technology and operational failures 
moreover  instances of fraud or other misconduct might also negatively impact the company s reputation and client confidence in the company  in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances 
despite the company s efforts to identify areas of risk  oversee operational areas involving risk  and implement policies and procedures designed to mitigate risk  there can be no assurance that the company will not suffer unexpected losses due to technology or other operational failures  including those of outsourced service providers 
the company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures 
the company s businesses are subject to the risk that a client or counterparty will fail to perform its contractual obligations  or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate 
the company s exposure mainly results from margin lending activities  securities lending activities  its role as a counterparty in financial contracts  investing activities  banking loan portfolios  and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the company s proprietary funds 
significant interest rate changes could affect the company s profitability and financial condition 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interest earning assets such as margin loans and customer mortgages and its funding sources  such as customer deposits and company borrowings 
changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on interest earning assets differently than the interest the company pays on its interest bearing liabilities 
in general  the company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment  and could be adversely affected by a general decline in interest rates  although any potential reduction in net interest income may be offset by growth in the company s loan portfolio and inflows of client cash 
in addition  in the event prevailing short term interest rates declined to the point where yields available on money market mutual funds approached the level of management fees on those funds  the company could find itself in the position of having to reduce its management fees so that it could continue to pay clients a competitive return on their assets 
potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on the company s financial position 
from time to time  the company evaluates potential strategic transactions  including business combinations  acquisitions  and dispositions 
any such transaction could have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
the process of evaluating  negotiating  and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management s attention from other business concerns  and might cause the loss of key clients  employees  and business partners 
moreover  the integration of any acquisition may create unforeseen challenges for the company s operational  financial  and management information systems  as well as unforeseen expenditures and other risks  including difficulties in managing facilities and employees in different geographic areas 
in addition  an acquisition may cause the company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation 
further  the company may not realize a positive return on any acquisition and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the company s current stockholders percentage ownership or to earnings per share eps 

table of contents the charles schwab corporation the company s stock price has fluctuated historically  and may continue to fluctuate 
the company s stock price can be volatile 
among the factors that may affect the company s stock price are the following speculation in the investment community or the press about  or actual changes in  the company s competitive position  organizational structure  executive team  operations  financial condition  financial reporting and results  effectiveness of cost reduction initiatives  or strategic transactions  the announcement of new products  services  acquisitions  or dispositions by the company or its competitors  increases or decreases in revenue or earnings  changes in earnings estimates by the investment community  and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results 
changes in the stock market generally or as it concerns the company s industry  as well as geopolitical  economic  and business factors unrelated to the company  may also affect the company s stock price 
developments in the business  economic  and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the company s business 
the company s business can be significantly affected by the general environment economic  corporate  securities market  regulatory  and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations  trading activity  interest rates and overall investor engagement 
these factors are outside of the control of the company and could have a negative impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition

item legal proceedings the company has been named as a party in various legal actions  and is the subject of various regulatory investigations  which include the matters described below 
it is inherently difficult to predict the outcome of these matters  particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages  or where investigations or proceedings are at an early stage  and the company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss that may be incurred from any potential judgment  settlement  or award 
however  based on current information and consultation with counsel  management believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on the financial condition or cash flows of the company  although a judgment  settlement or award could be material to the company s operating results for a particular future period  depending on results for that period
