critical accounting policies general 
the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use in our estimates 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable accounting method to another method 
although the economics of the company s transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact the company s transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on three basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  ii sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance and iii us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues  which requires adequate documentation to support the allowance for loan losses estimate 
the company s allowance for loan losses has two basic components the specific allowance and the general allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance for larger balance  non homogeneous loans 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
first  analysis of the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  the prospects for support from financial guarantors  and the fair market value of collateral are used to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses 
then the migration of historical default rates and loss severities  internal risk ratings  industry and market conditions and trends  and other environmental factors are considered 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the general allowance is used for estimating the loss on pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans  including family mortgage loans  installment loans  other consumer loans  and outstanding loan commitments 
also  the general allowance is used for the remaining pool of larger balance  non homogeneous loans which were not allocated a specific allowance upon their review 
the general allowance begins with estimates of probable losses inherent in the homogeneous portfolio based upon various statistical analyses 
these include analysis of historical and peer group delinquency and credit loss experience  together with analyses that reflect current trends and conditions 
the company also considers trends and changes in the volume and term of loans  changes in the credit process and or lending policies and procedures  and an evaluation of overall credit quality 
the general allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses 
as a result  even though this history is regularly updated with the most recent loss information  it could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
the general allowance also captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in the specific allowances 
executive overview this discussion is intended to focus on certain financial information regarding the company and the bank and may not contain all the information that is important to the reader 
the purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more thorough understanding of our financial statements 
as such  this discussion should be read carefully in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained elsewhere in this report 
the bank has become the primary  independent community bank in its immediate market area 
it seeks to be the primary financial service provider for its market area by providing the right mix of consistently high quality customer service  efficient technological support  value added products  and a strong commitment to the community 
net income of million in was a increase from net income of million 
the company and the bank experienced growth across all primary operating businesses with growth in commercial and retail lending  deposit accounts and core deposits  and assets under wms management 
during  the bank modified its loan pricing strategies and expanded its loan product offerings in an effort to increase lending activity without sacrificing the existing credit quality standards 
the result of this was a  and increase in net loan outstandings in   and  respectively 
deposits increased from year end to year end  and from year end to year end in  the bank gained in market customers who grew dissatisfied with the service and pricing resulting from the consolidation of other local community banks into larger  out of market financial institutions 
this trend slowed significantly during assets under management grew and  respectively  during and as management continued to focus more resources toward its wms business 
net interest income is the largest component of net income  and equals the difference between income generated on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
future trends regarding net interest income are dependent on the absolute level of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the amount of lost income from non performing assets  the amount of prepaying loans  the mix and amount of various deposit types  and many other factors  as well as the overall volume of interest earning assets 
these factors are individually difficult to predict  and when taken together  the uncertainty of future trends compounds 
based on management s current projections  net interest income may increase in and beyond as average interest earning assets increase  but this may be offset in part or in whole by a possible contraction in the bank s net interest margin resulting from competitive market conditions 
additionally  the bank s balance sheet is positioned for a stable or rising interest rate environment 
this means that net interest income is projected to increase if market interest rates rise  and to decrease if market interest rates fall  assuming no change in the shape of the interest rate yield curve 
a steeper yield curve is projected to result in an increase in net interest income  while a flatter or inverted yield curve is projected to result in a decrease in net interest income 
the specific nature of the bank s variability in net interest income due to changes in interest rates  also known as interest rate risk  is to a large degree the result of the bank s deposit base structure 
during  demand deposits  now  and savings deposits averaged   and of total average deposits  respectively  while the more interest rate sensitive premium now  money market accounts  and certificates of deposit averaged  and of total average deposits  respectively 
the bank continues to have strong credit quality as evidenced by non performing loans totaling  or of total loans at december   as compared with  or of total loans at december  the provision for loan losses was  for compared with  for the  or decrease in the provision for loan losses from to was largely in response to the continuation in the low level of non performing loans over the last year  partially offset by the growth in new loan originations during management seeks to continue the expansion of its branch network 
during  a new branch opened in bealeton  virginia in the southern part of fauquier county 
the bank looks to add to its branch network in western prince william county beyond the addition of a retail branch office in haymarket during the bank is looking toward these new retail markets for growth in deposits and wms income 
management seeks to increase the level of its fee income from deposits and wealth management services through the increase of its market share within its marketplace

provision for loan losses  allowance for loan losses  and asset quality the provision for loan losses was  for   for  and  for the amount of the provision for loan loss for  and was based upon management s continual evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which encompasses the overall risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  trends in the bank s delinquent and non performing loans  estimated values of collateral  and the impact of economic conditions on borrowers 
greater weight is given to the loss history by loan category  prolonged changes in portfolio delinquency trends by loan category  and changes in economic trends 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses from to and was largely in response to the decrease in non performing loans over the same period  partially offset by the impact of continued growth in new loan originations during and there can be no assurances  however  that future losses will not exceed estimated amounts  or that increased amounts of provisions for loan losses will not be required in future periods 
loan portfolio at december    and net loans accounted for  and  respectively  of total assets and were the largest category of the company s earning assets 
loans are shown on the balance sheets net of unearned discounts and the allowance for loan losses 
interest is computed by methods that result in level rates of return on principal 
loans are charged off when deemed by management to be uncollectible  after taking into consideration such factors as the current financial condition of the customer and the underlying collateral and guarantees 
the company has adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended by fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
fasb statement no 
 as amended  requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified for evaluation is to be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or  alternatively  the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral 
however  for those loans that are collateral dependent that is  if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable  the measure of impairment is to be based on the net realizable value of the collateral 
fasb statement no 
 as amended  also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on loans 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  expected future cash flows  financial condition of the borrower  and the current economic conditions 
a performing loan may be considered impaired if the factors above indicate a need for impairment 
a loan on non accrual status may not be impaired if it is in the process of collection or if the shortfall in payment is insignificant 
a delay of less than days or a shortfall of less than of the required principal and interest payments generally is considered insignificant and would not indicate an impairment situation  if in management s judgment the loan will be paid in full 
loans that meet the regulatory definitions of doubtful or loss generally qualify as impaired loans under fasb statement no 
as is the case for all loans  charge offs for impaired loans occur when the loan or portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectible 
the bank considers all consumer installment loans and residential mortgage loans to be homogenous loans 
these loans are not subject to individual impairment under fasb statement no 
asset quality non performing loans  in most cases  consist of loans that are days or more past due and for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
management evaluates all loans that are days or more past due  as well as borrowers that have suffered financial distress  to determine if they should be placed on non accrual status 
factors considered by management include the net realizable value of collateral  if any  and other resources of the borrower that may be available to satisfy the delinquency 
non performing loans totaled  or of total loans at december   as compared with  or of total loans at december  and  or of total loans at december  non performing loans as a percentage of the allowance for loan losses were  and at december   and  respectively 
loans that were days past due and accruing interest totaled   and  at december    and  respectively 
at december   loans days past due and accruing interest consisted primarily of three loans to one borrower totaling  secured by real estate and a partial small business administration sba guarantee 
no loss is anticipated on any loan days past due and accruing interest 
there are no loans  other than those disclosed above as either non performing or impaired  where information known about the borrower has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower s ability to repay 
at december    of the bank s ownership in freddie mac fhlmc preferred stock with a par value of  was deemed to be permanently impaired and was recognized as a loss on securities  available for sale  during at december   no additional amount of the bank s ownership in fhlmc preferred stock was deemed to be permanently impaired 
there are no other interest bearing assets that would be subject to disclosure as either non performing or impaired if such interest bearing assets were loans 
at december   no concentration of loans to commercial borrowers engaged in similar activities exceeded of total loans 
the largest industry concentrations at december  were approximately of loans to the hospitality industry hotels  motels  inns  etc 
and of loans for land development 
for more information regarding the bank s concentration of loans collateralized by real estate  please refer to the discussion under risk factors in item a of this report entitled we have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate and a downturn in the real estate market  for any reason  may increase our credit losses  which would negatively affect our financial results 
loans are placed on non accrual status when they have been specifically determined to be impaired or when principal or interest is delinquent for days or more  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed from income 
interest income generally is not recognized on specific impaired loans unless the likelihood of further loss is remote 
interest payments received on such loans are applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance 
interest income on other non accrual loans is recognized only to the extent of interest payments received 
total loans on the balance sheet are comprised of the following classifications as of december      and loan portfolio in thousands december  loans secured by real estate construction secured by farmland family residential commercial real estate commercial and industrial loans except those secured by real estate consumer loans to individuals except those secured by real estate all other loans total loans the following table sets forth certain information with respect to the bank s non accrual  restructured and past due loans  as well as foreclosed assets  at the dates indicated non performing assets and loans contractually past due in thousands december  non accrual loans restructured loans other repossessed assets owned total non performing assets loans past due days accruing interest allowance for loan losses to total loans at period end non performing assets to period end loans and other repossessed assets potential problem loans at december   management is not aware of any significant problem loans not included in table 
analysis of loan loss experience the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which  in management s judgment  is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  credit concentration  trends in historical loss experience  specific impaired loans  and current economic conditions 
management periodically reviews the loan portfolio to determine probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on net realizable values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
changes in the allowances relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses 
because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance remains subject to change 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  recorded as the provision for loan losses on the company s statements of income  are made monthly to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on management s analysis of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level of non performing loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged off or recovered during a given period and current national and local economic conditions 
at december      and the allowance for loan losses was     and  respectively

the allowance has been allocated according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within the following categories of loans at the dates indicated  although the entire allowance balance is available to absorb any actual charge offs that may occur 
during  the bank refined its policies  guidelines  and methods for determining the allowance for loan losses  and allocating the allowance among various loan categories

this increase stemmed primarily from revenues related to the continued growth of the bank s deposit base and retail banking activities  and the increase of estate and brokerage fees within the bank s wms division 
wealth management income increased  or from to service charges on deposit accounts increased  or to million for  compared with million for other service charges  commissions and fees increased  or from million in to million primarily due to increased income from bank owned life insurance boli  as well as increased income from visa check card fees 
the increase in boli income was due to an additional million boli purchase in december total boli was million at december  the increase in visa check fees is primarily due to the increase in the bank s retail deposit customer base 
management seeks to increase the level of its future fee income from wealth management services and deposits through the increase of its market share within its marketplace 
wealth management fees are projected to continue to grow  but at a pace closer to the moderate growth seen in rather than the growth seen in fees from deposits are projected to grow at a rate greater than seen in due to increased retail deposit marketing efforts 
subsequent to december   the bank entered into an agreement cancelling a property usage contract 
in consideration for this agreement  the bank will receive a one time payment of  or approximately  net of applicable income taxes  which will be recognized during the first quarter of additionally  for asset liability restructuring purposes  subsequent to december   management elected to sell approximately million of investment securities available for sale for a loss of  the loss will also be recognized during the first quarter of management does not project any further gains or losses on the sale of securities at this time 
compared with total non interest income increased by  from million in to million in other income is derived primarily from non interest fee income  which consists primarily of fiduciary and other wealth management fees  service charges on deposit accounts  and other fee income 
this increase stemmed primarily from revenues related to the continued growth of the bank s deposit base and retail banking activities  and the increase of estate and brokerage fees within the bank s wealth management services division 
these increases were mostly offset by the  year to year decrease in revenues resulting from gains and losses on the securities portfolio available for sale 
wealth management income increased  or from to service charges on deposit accounts increased  or to million for  compared with million for the major factor in the increase in service charges on deposit accounts was the impact of the bank s average demand deposit base increasing from million during to million during other service charges  commissions and fees decreased  or from million in to million primarily due to the bank s sale of its portfolio of merchant card customers in the first quarter of  partially offset by increased income from visa check card fees 
the result of merchant card portfolio sale resulted in a reduction of service charge income of approximately  per quarter  offset by an approximate  per quarter reduction in merchant card operating expenses 
the loss on securities available for sale of  represents the amount of the bank s ownership in fhlmc preferred stock deemed to be permanently impaired at december  gains on securities  available for sale were  for  as a result of selling million of available for sale government agency and corporate securities  whose weighted average remaining maturity was approximately one year  for a gain on sale of  and reinvesting the proceeds from the sale into available for sale government agency securities with a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately four years 
this was partially offset by a loss on the sale of a million investment in a short term mortgage backed security bond mutual fund 
non interest expense compared with total non interest expense increased  or in compared with the primary component of this was an increase in salaries and employees benefits of  or  primarily due to customary annual salary increases 
full time equivalent personnel grew slightly from at year end to at year end in addition  increases in the defined benefit retirement plan expense added to increased salary and employees benefit expense in other operating expenses increased  or in compared with this increase was primarily due to the increase in marketing and business development expenses  as well as professional fees primarily attributable to meeting the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley 
management expects the costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance to further increase in in connection with implementing the requirements of section regarding management s report on internal controls 
the bank expects personnel costs  consisting primarily of salary and benefits  to continue to be its largest other expense 
as such  the most important factor with regard to potential changes in other expenses is the expansion of staff 
the cost of any additional staff expansion  however  would be expected to be offset by the increased revenue generated by the additional services that the new staff would enable the bank to perform 
compared with total non interest expense increased million  or in compared with the primary component of this was an increase in salaries and employees benefits of million  or  primarily due to the increase in full time equivalent personnel from approximately at year end and at year end to at year end  as well as customary annual salary increases 
the growth in personnel primarily reflects the expansion of the lending and retail functions 
additionally  the decrease in the number of loans originated in when compared with  reduced the amount of salary and benefit expense that could be deferred through the application of sfas no 
accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct cost of leases 
sfas no 
deals with the timing of recognition of loan and lease origination fees and certain expenses 
the statement requires that such fees and costs  if material  be deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the asset 
also  significant increases in the defined benefit pension plan expense and the cost of medical insurance benefits added to increased salary and employees benefit expense in other operating expenses increased  or in compared with this increase was primarily due to the increase in legal and other professional fees that can be primarily attributed to meeting the requirements of sarbanes oxley 
income taxes income tax expense increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  income tax expense increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the effective tax rates were in  for  and for the effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of due to the bank s investment in tax exempt loans and securities  and income from the boli purchases 
comparison of december  and december  financial condition total assets were million at december   an increase of or million from million at december  balance sheet categories reflecting significant changes included cash and due from banks  investment securities  total loans  deposits  and federal home loan bank advances 
each of these categories is discussed below 
cash and due from banks 
cash and due from banks was million at december   reflecting an increase of million from december  the increase in cash and due from banks was primarily the result of increasing the bank s deposits with the federal reserve bank of richmond in order to satisfy reserve requirements 
investment securities 
total investment securities were million at december   reflecting a decrease of million from million at december  the decrease was primarily the result of redeploying the cash flow from investment securities into loans

the bank s loans are made primarily to customers located within the bank s primary market area 
the bank continually modifies its loan pricing strategies and expands its loan product offerings in an effort to increase lending activity without sacrificing the existing credit quality standards 
this was the primary reason for the year to year increase in commercial and residential real estate loans outstanding 
management will continue the same pricing strategies during  but does not project to originate the same level of family residential real estate loans as in  primarily due to competitive pressures and market interest rates

for the year ended december   total deposits grew million or when compared with total deposits one year earlier 
non interest bearing deposits increased by million and interest bearing deposits increased by million 
the growth in the bank s non interest bearing deposits during was the result of many possible factors difficult to segregate and quantify  and equally difficult to use as factors for future projections 
one possible factor was the bank gaining in market customers who grew dissatisfied with the service resulting from the consolidation of other local community banks into larger  out of market financial institutions 
additional growth was generated by gaining deposits from new loan customers

as discussed above under government supervision and regulation  banking regulations have established minimum capital requirements for financial institutions  including risk based capital ratios and leverage ratios 
as of december   the appropriate regulatory authorities have categorized the company and the bank as well capitalized 
the primary sources of funds are deposits  repayment of loans  maturities of investments  funds provided from operations and advances from the fhlb of atlanta 
while scheduled repayments of loans and maturities of investment securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan repayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank uses its sources of funds to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  to maintain liquidity  and to meet operating expenses 
management monitors projected liquidity needs and determines the desirable funding level based in part on the bank s commitments to make loans and management s assessment of the bank s ability to generate funds 
management is not aware of any market or institutional trends  events or uncertainties that are expected to have a material effect on the liquidity  capital resources or operations of the company or the bank 
nor is management aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities that would have a material effect on liquidity  capital resources or operations 
the bank s internal sources of such liquidity are deposits  loan and investment repayments  and securities available for sale 
the bank s primary external source of liquidity is advances from the fhlb of atlanta 
cash and amounts due from depository institutions  interest bearing deposits in other banks  and federal funds sold totaled million at december  compared with million at december  these assets provide a primary source of liquidity for the bank 
in addition  management has designated the entire investment portfolio as available of sale  of which approximately million is unpledged and readily salable 
futhermore  the bank has an available line of credit with the fhlb of atlanta with a borrowing limit of approximately million at december  to provide additional sources of liquidity  as well as available federal funds purchased lines of credit with various commercial banks totaling approximately million 
at december   million of the fhlb of atlanta line of credit and million of federal funds purchased lines of credit were in use 
the following table sets forth information relating to the company s sources of liquidity and the outstanding commitments for use of liquidity at december  the liquidity coverage ratio is derived by dividing the total sources of liquidity by the outstanding commitments for use of liquidity

failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and the bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined in the regulations  and of tier i capital to average assets as defined in the regulations 
management believes  as of december  that the company and the bank more than satisfy all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
at december  and  the company exceeded its regulatory capital ratios  as set forth in the following table risk based capital ratios in thousands december  tier capital shareholders equity plus unrealized loss on securities available for sale less intangible assets  net plus company obligated madatorily redeemable capital securities total tier capital tier capital allowable allowance for loan losses total capital risk weighted assets risk based capital ratios tier to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets contractual obligations the following table sets forth information relating to the company s contractual obligations and scheduled payment amounts due at various intervals over the next five years and beyond as of december  payments due by period less than more than in thousands total one year years years years contractual obligations long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total has varying put provisions beginning march  with a mandatory redemption march  off balance sheet arrangements the bank s off balance sheet arrangements consist of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  which were million and million  respectively at december   and million and million  respectively  at december  see note financial instruments with off balance sheet risk of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the specific arrangements and elements of credit and interest rate risk inherent to the arrangements 
the impact on liquidity of these arrangements is illustrated in the liquidity sources and uses table above

during and  no liabilities arose from standby letters of credit arrangements 
past history gives little indication as to future trends regarding revenues and liabilities from standby letters of credit 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of the company and the bank are monetary in nature 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than inflation does 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk an important component of both earnings performance and liquidity is management of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income and economic value of equity from a change in market interest rates 
the bank is subject to interest rate sensitivity to the degree that its interest earning assets mature or reprice at different time intervals than its interest bearing liabilities 
however  the bank is not subject to the other major categories of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
the bank uses a number of tools to manage its interest rate risk  including simulating net interest income under various scenarios  monitoring the present value change in equity under the same scenarios  and monitoring the difference or gap between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over various time periods 
management believes that rate risk is best measured by simulation modeling 
the earnings simulation model forecasts annual net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effect on net interest income and present value equity under varying market rate assumptions 
the bank monitors exposure to instantaneous changes in rates of up to basis points up or down over a rolling month period 
the bank s policy limit for the maximum negative impact on net interest income and change in equity from instantaneous changes in interest rates of basis points over months is and  respectively 
management has maintained a risk position well within these guideline levels during the following tables present the bank s anticipated market value changes in equity under various rate scenarios as of december  and market risk percentage market minus current plus market percentage dollars in thousands change value change pts fair value pts value change change federal funds sold securities loans receivable total rate sensitive assets other assets total assets demand deposits rate bearing deposits borrowed funds other liabilities total liabilities present value equity total liabilities and equity percentage market minus current plus market percentage dollars in thousands change value change pts fair value pts value change change federal funds sold securities loans receivable total rate sensitive assets other assets total assets demand deposits rate bearing deposits borrowed funds other liabilities total liabilities present value equity total liabilities and equity
