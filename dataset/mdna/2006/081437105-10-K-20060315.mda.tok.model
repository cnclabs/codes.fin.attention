overview bemis company  inc is a leading global manufacturer of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of markets 
generally about percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry 
sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store 
other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include medical devices  personal care  and lawn and garden 
our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry provides a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment  which accounts for about percent of our net sales 
the remaining percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which  while diversified in end use products  is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets 
in recent years we have actively expanded our global reach with acquisitions and capital additions  growing net sales in non us markets from percent in to percent in market conditions during and  higher petrochemical feedstock costs significantly increased the price of polymer resins and adhesives  the primary raw materials for our business segments 
our business model has been developed to accommodate such cost increases by periodically adjusting selling prices to reflect increased costs 
as raw material prices increase  the time lag between cost increases and selling price increases results in reduced operating margins 
during the first half of  this negative impact on operating profit was magnified by production volume fluctuations due to a shift in customer order patterns and a highly competitive environment 
during the second half of  the plastics industry was challenged to find alternative sources of raw materials as the petrochemical industry suffered facility damage  production disruptions and transportation shortages due to the impact of the gulf coast hurricanes 
bemis successfully managed raw material supplies in this challenging environment and remained a reliable supplier to our customers 
restructuring and related charges during the third quarter of  we initiated a restructuring program in which three flexible packaging plants were closed 
this program eliminated less efficient capacity and consolidated production of monolayer blown film into fewer  more efficient facilities 
while most of the restructuring activities were completed as of december  resulting in a net charge of million for  gains and losses related to the sale of these closed facilities resulted in a net gain of million during and a loss of million during during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a restructuring program for our pressure sensitive materials business segment to reduce capacity and fixed costs associated with our label materials product line 
the majority of the restructuring activities were completed by the second quarter of restructuring charges totaled million in the fourth quarter of  million in and a net gain of million in on january   we announced a million facility consolidation project intended to reduce fixed costs and shift production to lower cost facilities 
of this total charge  approximately million is expected to be expensed during the first half of these restructuring costs include the estimated cost of plant shutdowns  corporate headquarters relocation  employee severance  equipment relocation and other exit activities 
we estimate the savings resulting from the restructuring events to be approximately million annually  a portion of which will be realized in the second half of acquisitions our acquisitions strategy is growth oriented  focused on the identification of businesses that offer unique packaging technologies  access to new markets or product lines  or critical mass 
since the beginning of  we have completed three acquisitions to enhance the breadth of our product offerings and expand the market and geographic participation of our business segments 
these three acquisitions have added approximately million of net sales  all of which is from non us manufacturing plants 
these plants are focused on serving the needs of the geographic regions in which they reside 
on january   we acquired majority ownership of dixie toga sa  one of the largest packaging companies in south america with annual revenues totaling about million 
the acquisition included the outstanding voting common stock of dixie toga in addition to percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock 
the initial cash purchase price was approximately million 
this acquisition significantly increases our exposure to the growing south american packaging market and provides a strong platform from which to introduce our propriety film products to a new region 
since  bemis and dixie toga have operated a joint venture in brazil  known as itap bemis ltda  and have established a successful working relationship 
results of operations consolidated overview dollars in millions  except per share amounts net sales operating profit net income diluted earnings per share versus for the year ended december   net sales increased percent 
acquisitions accounted for percent of the increase in sales while currency translation was insignificant to net sales growth in the remaining percent increase in net sales reflects the impact of increased prices and a shift in product mix in all market categories 
price increases during were driven by increased raw material costs 
unit volume was flat compared to operating profit increased percent in reflecting the profits contributed by the dixie toga acquisition 
operating profit in includes a million gain on the sale of an in house rotogravure graphics plant 
in addition  restructuring and related activities included in operating profit accounted for a million gain in and a million expense in excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of the plant and any restructuring and related activities  operating profit would have been million in compared to million in operating profit in was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and a related shift in customer order patterns in the first half of the year 
diluted earnings per share were for  which included a per share of tax charges related to the repatriation of international subsidiary earnings under the american jobs creation act of for  diluted earnings per share totaled  which included restructuring and related charges of about per share and a gain of per share on the sale of certain plant assets 
versus net sales in increased percent from net sales of billion in acquisitions accounted for percent of the net sales growth  while currency translation accounted for about percent 
the remaining percent sales growth primarily reflects the solid increase in flexible packaging sales volumes during operating profit increased percent in operating profit in includes a million gain on the sale of an in house rotogravure graphics plant 
in addition  restructuring and related activities included in operating profit accounted for a million expense in and a million expense in excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of the plant and any restructuring and related activities  operating profit would have been million in compared to million in cost savings in resulting from the completed restructuring programs were partially offset by increased pension expense 
sales mix improvements resulted in increased operating profit during during  competitive pricing pressures for flexible packaging products sold into industrial markets and for pressure sensitive label materials  in addition to increases in certain resin costs  contributed to lower margins 
for  diluted earnings per share totaled  including restructuring and related charges of about per share and a gain of per share on the sale of certain plant assets 
diluted earnings per share for totaled  including of restructuring and related charges 
flexible packaging business segment our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets  including meat and cheese  confectionery and snack  frozen foods  lawn and garden  health and hygiene  beverages  medical devices  bakery and dry foods 
these markets are generally less affected by economic cycles and grow through product innovation and geographical expansion 
the most significant raw materials used in this business segment are polymer resins  which we use to develop and manufacture single layer and multilayer film products 
during periods of unusual raw material cost volatility  selling price changes may lag behind changes in our raw material costs 
resin costs increased dramatically in and these raw material costs were reflected in increased selling prices throughout each year  however the magnitude and frequency of the cost increases negatively impacted operating profit 
in july  we announced a restructuring effort to reduce fixed costs  take out monolayer film capacity and direct production volume to more efficient facilities 
we closed three flexible packaging manufacturing facilities in the third quarter of  recording restructuring and related charges of million during the net restructuring gain of million in and the net restructuring charge of million in  both classified as other costs income  net  relate primarily to the sale of closed facilities 
dollars in millions net sales operating profit operating profit as a percentage of net sales versus our flexible packaging business segment recorded a percent increase in net sales in acquisitions increased sales by percent 
the remaining percent increase is attributable to price and mix across all market categories 
unit sales volume was even with as increases in demand for packaging in markets such as meat and cheese  health and hygiene  cereal and other dry foods  coffee  unitizing films for cans and bottles  and medical devices were offset by lower unit sales for markets such as confectionery and snack  frozen foods  bakery and pet products 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain of million from the sale of a manufacturing facility in florence  kentucky that supported internal rotogravure graphics capabilities 
excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of that facility as well as restructuring and related activities  operating profit as a percentage of net sales would have been percent in and percent in savings resulting from the restructuring program were significantly offset by increased pension costs and incentive compensation costs in versus net sales increased percent in  primarily driven by increased unit sales volume 
strong unit sales in markets for meat and cheese  confectionery and snack foods  frozen foods  personal care products  cereal products and unitizing film for cans and bottles were partially offset by lower unit sales to bakery  pet product and industrial markets 
price increases and a shift in product mix increased sales by about percent in  as customers balanced price increases with changes in product mix 
acquisitions accounted for an increase of percent and currency translation accounted for percent of the improvement from during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain of million from the sale of a manufacturing facility in florence  kentucky that supported internal rotogravure graphics capabilities 
excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of that facility as well as restructuring and related activities  operating profit as a percentage of net sales would have been percent in compared to percent in savings resulting from the restructuring program were significantly offset by increased pension costs and incentive compensation costs in pressure sensitive materials business segment the pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets prime and variable information labels  which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets  graphic design  used to create signage and decorations  and technical components  which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics  automotive  battery  construction and medical industries 
paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment 
for the last several years  general economic conditions have had a greater influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs 
during  the increased cost of petrochemical products caused an associated increase in the cost of adhesive materials in addition to a concern about availability of adhesive from suppliers 
in response to these cost increases  we increased selling prices and secured alternative supplies of raw materials in case of shortages 
we focused on margin expansion by introducing new product innovations and quality initiatives during the year 
in addition  recent restructuring activities resulted in better capacity utilization in label products 
in october of  we announced the restructuring of our label products capacity 
we closed two facilities to reduce fixed costs and improve capacity utilization in our label products line 
restructuring and related charges of million were recorded in  of which million represented severance and other similar charges and was recorded as other costs income  net 
the remaining million related to accelerated depreciation of assets and related charges and was recorded as an element of costs of products sold 
during  restructuring and related charges totaling million primarily reflected the cost of closing a label products plant in nevada 
of this total  million represented equipment relocation and was recorded as other costs income  net  with the remaining costs associated with accelerated depreciation charged to costs of products sold 
during  a net gain of million was recorded for the sale of previously closed facilities and property 
during  we changed the year end for several of our pressure sensitive materials european subsidiaries from november to december this resulted in a month reporting period in for this subsidiary  increasing net sales by million  but the impact on operating profit was minimal 
dollars in millions net sales operating profit operating profit as a percentage of net sales versus our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales increase of percent in excluding the impact of the thirteenth month of net sales from the european subsidiary  net sales would have increased percent 
this increase was driven by unit sales volume growth in label products during the year  partially offset by unit sales volume decreases in the other pressure sensitive product categories 
price increases were offset by a negative sales mix change in  and currency had no impact on net sales for the year 
operating profit increased in excluding the impact of restructuring and related activities  operating profit would have been million  or percent of net sales in compared to million  or percent of net sales in currency translation did not impact operating profit in improved profit levels in reflect improved sales mix and focused cost control measures 
versus a november acquisition of a european graphic products business increased net sales in by percent and currency translation provided a percent increase 
about percent of the sales from this business segment are from our manufacturing operations in belgium  which benefited from the strengthening of the european currencies during stronger unit sales of technical products more than offset slightly lower unit sales of label and graphic products compared to price and mix provided a combined improvement to net sales during the year of about percent 
operating profit more than doubled in compared to excluding the impact of restructuring and related activities  operating profit would have been million or percent of net sales in compared to million or percent of net sales in currency translation contributed million to operating profit in improved profit levels in reflect improved sales mix  focused cost control measures  and the savings associated with restructuring activities  partially offset by increased pension expense 
consolidated gross margin dollars in millions gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales restructuring and related charges reduced gross margins by million in and million in the time lag between the implementation of selling price increases and dramatic increases in raw material costs reduced gross margins as a percentage of net sales in each of the years presented 
this reduction in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by ongoing improvements in production efficiency  sales mix and cost management during the same timeframe 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expense as a percentage of net sales in  the lower ratio of expenses to net sales reflects lower costs associated with the south american operations and the impact of higher selling prices on consolidated net sales 
an increased ratio of expenses as a percent of net sales for reflects the larger sales organization associated with our global sales efforts and an increase from in broad based incentive compensation and pension expense 
other expenses dollars in millions research and development expenses r d r d expense as a percentage of net sales interest expense other costs income  net minority interest income taxes effective tax rate research and development expenses our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations 
our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment  bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment 
we believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency  effectiveness  and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products 
expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold 
interest expense the increase in interest expense in reflects higher debt levels as a result of the january acquisition of dixie toga and higher interest rates in compared to and prior to  substantially all of our outstanding debt was subject to variable interest rates which averaged percent in and percent in in  we issued million of fixed rate public bonds at a percent interest rate 
this effectively reduced our percentage of variable rate debt to about percent of total debt in as variable rates climbed to an average of percent during other costs income  net in  net other expenses primarily reflect interest income offset by currency exchange losses 
net other income in includes a million gain on the sale of a rotogravure facility during the fourth quarter partially offset by restructuring and related charges of million 
equity income from our brazilian joint venture was million in  reflecting improved profitability in addition to an increase in our equity ownership from percent to percent in january the remainder of other income in is primarily interest income 
during  net other costs included million of restructuring and related charges associated with employee severance and the closure of manufacturing facilities 
the brazilian joint venture accounted for million of equity income during since the january acquisition of dixie toga  the brazilian joint venture is accounted for on a consolidated basis and the related operating results are included with the flexible packaging segment 
minority interest in connection with the january  acquisition  we acquired approximately percent of the total outstanding shares of dixie toga 
as of december   our ownership had increased to approximately percent of the total outstanding shares 
the increase in minority interest in is primarily due to the shares of dixie toga that were not acquired 
income taxes during  an additional million of tax expense was recorded as a result of the repatriation of non us subsidiary earnings under the american jobs creation act of excluding the effect of this additional tax  the effective tax rate for was percent 
our effective tax rate was percent in and percent in the difference between our overall tax rate and the u 
s 
statutory tax rate of percent in each of those three years principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources credit rating our capital structure and financial practices have earned the company long term credit ratings of a from standard poor s and baa from moody s investors service  and a credit rating of a and prime for our commercial paper program from standard poor s and moody s investors service  respectively 
our strong financial positions and credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest 
sources of liquidity cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in cash provided by operations in each of the years ended december   and was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our us pension plans of million  million and million  respectively 
while no contributions are required for  we continue to monitor the funded status of our us pension plans and will evaluate the benefits of future voluntary contributions subject to available liquidity 
increasing raw material costs during the three year period resulted in increased levels of working capital  which had a negative impact on cash provided by operations during and in addition to using cash provided by operations  we issue commercial paper to meet our liquidity needs 
at year end  our commercial paper debt outstanding was million 
based upon our current credit rating  we have ready access to the commercial paper markets 
while not anticipated  if these markets were to become illiquid or if a credit rating downgrade limited our ability to issue commercial paper  we would draw upon our existing back up credit facility 
in september  we renegotiated our back up credit facility to extend the term to september this credit facility provides million of available financing supported by a group of major us and international banks 
covenants imposed by this bank credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses  minimum net worth calculations  and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization 
in addition to funds available under this credit facility  we also have the capability of issuing up to approximately million of extendable commercial notes ecns  which are short term instruments whose maturity can be extended to days from the date of issuance 
if these credit facilities and ecns were no longer available to us  we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market  which would increase our borrowing costs 
commercial paper outstanding at december   has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis 
the related back up credit agreement expires in the million credit facility includes a million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries 
as of december   outstanding multicurrency borrowings under the credit facility totaled million which were used to fund the repatriation of international subsidiary earnings to the us based parent company 
borrowings from the credit agreement mature in september and charge a variable interest rate 
as of december   available capacity on the credit agreement which matures in september was million 
uses of liquidity capital expenditures capital expenditures were million during  compared to million in and million in during  we invested in additional capacity for our south american operations to meet strong demand for our shrink bag products and we invested in new capacity in our high growth north american production plants 
capital expenditures for are estimated to be in the million to million range 
after  capital expenditures are expected to return to levels approximately equivalent to total annual depreciation and amortization expenses 
dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend by percent during the first quarter of to cents per share from cents per share 
this follows increases of percent in and percent in in february  the board of directors approved the rd consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to cents per share  a percent increase 
share repurchases during  we purchased million shares of common stock in the open market 
we also established a program to purchase shares annually to offset the dilutive effect of stock award programs 
we did not make any share repurchases during or as of december   we are authorized to purchase up to million shares of common stock for the treasury 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations  capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations and certain other purchase obligations as of december  contractual payments due by period in millions total less than year to years to years more than years debt payments interest expense capital leases operating leases purchase obligations these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
a portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on september  a portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates 
the amounts disclosed above assume that variable interest rates are equal to rates at december  amount noted includes estimated interest costs 
the present value of these obligations  excluding interest  is included on our consolidated balance sheets 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials  utilities  capital equipment and various other goods and services 
interest rate swaps our long term unsecured notes include million due in august in september  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with three us banks  which increased our exposure to variable rates 
we generally prefer variable rate debt since it has been our experience that borrowing at variable rates is less expensive than borrowing at fixed rates over the long term 
these interest rate swap agreements  which expire in  reduced the interest cost of the million of long term debt from percent to about percent in since these variable rates are based upon six month london interbank offered rates libor  calculated in arrears  at the semiannual interest payment dates of the corresponding notes  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require that the fair value of these swaps  which have been designated as hedges of our fixed rate unsecured notes outstanding  be recorded as an asset or liability of the company 
the fair value of these swaps was recorded as an asset of million at december   and an asset of million at december  for each period  an offsetting increase is recorded in the fair value of the related long term notes outstanding 
these fair value adjustments do not impact the actual balance of outstanding principal on the notes  nor do they impact the income statement or related cash flows 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
market risks and foreign currency exposures we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 
our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control  counterparty risk  and ongoing reporting 
these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates  establish rates for future issuance of public bonds  and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates 
interest expense calculated on our outstanding debt is substantially subject to short term interest rates 
as such  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
for each one percent increase in variable interest rates  the annual interest expense on million of total debt outstanding would increase by million 
our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than nine months 
counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
we have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
the net settlement amount fair value related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contacts is insignificant and recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs income  net  which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability 
the operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of million from net sales levels in operating profit improved by approximately million as a result of the positive effect of foreign currency translation during long term compensation our practice of awarding long term compensation has relied primarily on restricted stock programs that are valued at the time of the award and expensed over the vesting period 
the and stock incentive plans for certain key employees provide for the issuance of up to  and  grants  respectively 
total compensation expense related to these plans was  in   in  and  in in addition  we have granted stock options in the past 
beginning in  we discontinued the awarding of stock options 
stock options granted prior to were granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and exercisable  upon vesting  over varying periods up to ten years from the date of grant 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we disclose the impact on net income and earnings per share of stock options outstanding  as if compensation expense were measured using a fair value method  in the footnotes accompanying our financial statements 
beginning january   accounting rules require us to follow a fair value based method of recognizing expense for stock options 
if we had followed this fair value method during  the impact on diluted earnings per share would have been insignificant for the year ended  one cent for the year ended  and two cents for the year ended we expect the impact to diluted earnings per share for to be insignificant 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to retirement benefits  intangible assets  goodwill  and expected future performance of operations 
our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities  and the valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill 
accounting for annual pension costs we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with fas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
a substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the united states 
as permitted by fas no 
 we use a calculated value of plan assets which is further described below 
fas no 
requires that the effects of the performance of the pension plan s assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on our computation of pension income or expense be amortized over future periods 
pension expense recorded in was million  compared to pension expense of million in and million in effective january   our largest us defined benefit pension plan has been amended to substantially reduce future pension benefits affecting approximately two thirds of the plan participants 
for those employees impacted  future pension benefits will be replaced with a defined contribution plan which is subject to achievement of certain financial performance goals of the company 
as a result  we expect pension expense to be to be lower than depending upon our financial performance in  this reduction in pension expense is expected to be substantially offset by expenses under the new defined contribution plan 
one element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with fas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
as of january   for our us defined benefit pension plans  we have assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be percent 
this is consistent with the rate assumed for and a decrease from the percent level assumed for to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation 
using historical long term investment periods of  and years  our pension plan assets have earned rates of return of percent  percent and percent  respectively  each in excess of our assumed rates 
in future years  we expect that returns will be lower than the historical returns discussed above due to a generally lower inflation and interest rate environment 
considering this  we selected an percent long term rate of return on assets assumption as of january  using our target asset allocation of plan assets of percent equity securities and percent fixed income securities  our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable 
this assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years 
this process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods 
the net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income and expense 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities 
this discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to changes in rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   for our us defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be percent  a decrease of one quarter of one percent from the percent rate used at december pension assumptions sensitivity analysis the following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets 
dollars in millions total increase decrease to pension expense from current assumptions discount rate percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent rate of return on plan assets percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent the following chart depicts the sensitivity of the minimum pension liability adjustment to equity to changes in the assumed discount rate 
dollars in millions total increase decrease in minimum pension liability  net of taxes  from current assumptions discount rate percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent if the discount rate had been reduced to percent at december   the accumulated benefit obligation for the largest of the defined benefit pension plans would exceed the related plan assets 
this would have required a minimum pension liability adjustment with a corresponding reduction to equity  net of tax  of about million 
a further decrease in discount rate to percent would only result in an additional equity adjustment of million 
intangible assets and goodwill the purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  liabilities assumed  and goodwill 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including intangible assets 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was million as of december  intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology  customer relationships  patents  trademarks  and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to years  when purchased 
we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events  operating condition and amounts of future cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which will significantly change accounting practice with respect to employee stock options 
the securities and exchange commission sec has delayed the mandated adoption date for public companies with a december year end until january  fas r requires that the company measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
the company expects that the impact of adopting this standard will be insignificant to the company s results of operation
