item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction general the following discussion and financial information is presented to aid in understanding regions financial corporation s regions or the company financial position and results of operations 
the emphasis of this discussion will be on the years  and  in addition  financial information for prior years will also be presented when appropriate 
certain amounts in prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
on july   regions merged with union planters corporation union planters headquartered in memphis  tennessee 
the combination with union planters added approximately billion of assets  billion of loans  and billion of deposits 
this transaction was accounted for as a purchase of union planters by regions and accordingly prior period financial statements have not been restated  except certain share and per share amounts related to the exchange of regions common stock 
union planters results of operations were included in regions results beginning july  comparisons with prior periods are significantly impacted by the merger with union planters see note business combinations to the consolidated financial statements 
regions primary business is providing traditional commercial and retail banking services to customers throughout its geographic footprint 
regions banking subsidiary  regions bank  has operations in alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  iowa  kentucky  louisiana  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  texas and virginia 
in  regions banking operations  excluding trust activities  contributed approximately million to consolidated net income 
in addition to providing traditional commercial and retail banking services  regions provides other financial services in the fields of investment banking  asset management  trust  mutual funds  securities brokerage  mortgage banking  insurance  commercial accounts receivable factoring and other specialty financing 
regions provides investment banking and brokerage services through offices of morgan keegan company  inc morgan keegan 
morgan keegan contributed approximately million to net income in  including trust activities 
regions mortgage banking operations  regions mortgage and equifirst corporation equifirst  provide residential mortgage loan origination and servicing activities for customers and contributed approximately million to net income in regions mortgage serviced approximately billion in mortgage loans as of december  regions provides full line insurance brokerage services primarily through rebsamen insurance  inc  one of the largest insurance brokers in the country 
credit life insurance services for customers are provided through other regions affiliates 
insurance activities contributed approximately million to net income in regions profitability  like that of many other financial institutions  is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and non interest income sources 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income regions receives on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense regions pays on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
regions net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities 
non interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts  trust and securities brokerage activities  mortgage origination and servicing  insurance and other customer services which regions provides 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses and non interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and other operating expenses  including income taxes 
economic conditions  competition and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government in general  significantly affect financial institutions  including regions 
lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by the level of business spending and investment  consumer income  spending and savings  capital market activities  competition among financial institutions  customer preferences  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in regions primary market areas 
regions business strategy has been and continues to be focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services  delivering quality customer service and maintaining a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations 
the company s principal market areas are located in the states of alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  iowa  kentucky  louisiana  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  texas and virginia 
morgan keegan also operates offices in massachusetts and new york 
highlights regions most significant accomplishment in was the successful three phase conversion of more than union planters bank branches to regions banking systems 
the integration of systems was accomplished ahead of the original schedule and resulted in minimal negative impact to regions customers 
the integration is expected to result in improved returns through increased operational efficiencies and strengthened customer relationships 
regions reported net income available to common shareholders of per diluted share in  including a reduction of 
per diluted share related to million net of tax in merger and storm related expenses 
net income available to common shareholders was per diluted share in net interest income for was billion  compared to billion in the net interest margin for was  up from in the increase in the net interest margin was due primarily to favorable balance sheet positioning in a rising interest rate environment during  regions  being in a slightly asset sensitive balance sheet position  benefited from rising interest rates during  as increases in asset yields outpaced increases in interest bearing liability costs 
additionally  a shift in the mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities benefited the company 
loans  typically regions highest yielding asset  increased slightly as a percentage of total earning assets 
low cost core deposits comprised a larger percentage of interest bearing liabilities  resulting from marketing campaigns targeting such products  as well as an influx of low cost deposits during the last two quarters of in hurricane katrina impacted areas 
as of december   interest rate sensitivity analysis indicated regions balance sheet remains in a slightly asset sensitive position 
net charge offs totaled million  or  of average loans in  compared to in non performing assets decreased million to million at december  non interest income excluding security gains losses totaled of total revenue tax equivalent basis in  as regions continued to benefit from a diversified revenue steam 
brokerage and investment banking revenues increased in  attributable to strong private client  equity capital markets  and investment advisory income streams during the year 
service charges on deposit accounts increased significantly in  due primarily to deposit accounts added from the union planters merger 
residential mortgage servicing and origination fees were higher in  due to business activity added in connection with the union planters merger  as well as a relatively low interest rate environment 
non interest expense totaled billion in compared to billion in included in non interest expense in are merger and storm related charges of million 
regions incurred merger related expenses throughout the merger integration process incident to the regions and union planters merger 
through the integration of regions and union planters  regions expects continued realization of efficiencies in the banking unit  as well as other lines of business 
regions realized million in cumulative cost savings in in connection with the merger 
regions intends to continue to invest in many areas of the franchise  including personnel  technology and product delivery channels to increase revenue and improve efficiencies while continuing to provide superior customer service 
on august   hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast as a powerful category hurricane  causing significant flood and wind damage and loss of life  property  power  and income along the coastal areas of louisiana including new orleans  mississippi  and alabama 
at december   only of the regions branches affected by hurricane katrina remained closed due to the damage sustained from the hurricane and subsequent flooding 
as of december   regions had approximately billion in outstanding loans in the most significantly impacted areas 
as a result of this disaster  regions expects some continued impact to certain revenue streams due to business interruptions caused by this disaster 
in addition  incremental costs are expected to be incurred related to the disaster  a significant portion of which is expected to be covered by insurance 
critical accounting policies in preparing financial information  management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses for the periods shown 
the accounting principles followed by regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general banking practices 
estimates and assumptions most significant to regions are related primarily to allowance for loan losses  intangibles excess purchase price  other identifiable intangible assets and mortgage serving rights and income taxes  and are summarized in the following discussion and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which is based on the factors and risk identification procedures discussed in the following pages  requires the use of judgments and estimates that may change in the future 
changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance  or the availability of new information  could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods 
for example  management has used judgments and estimates in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses related to the impact of hurricane katrina 
the availability of additional or different information affecting customers in the katrina impacted areas could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  may require that additions be made to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and estimates 
intangible assets regions intangible assets consist primarily of excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses excess purchase price  other identifiable intangible assets primarily core deposit intangibles and amounts capitalized for the right to service mortgage loans 
regions excess purchase price is tested for impairment annually  or more often if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
adverse changes in the economic environment  operations of acquired business units  or other factors could result in a decline in implied fair value of excess purchase price 
if the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount  a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to implied fair value 
other identifiable intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles  are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset  such as loss of core deposits  increased competition or adverse changes in the economy 
to the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable  an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount to the fair value 
for purposes of evaluating mortgage servicing impairment  regions must estimate the value of its mortgage servicing rights msr 
msr do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices 
although sales of msr do occur  the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available 
as a result  regions stratifies its mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics  including loan type and contractual note rate  and values its msr using discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows  taking into consideration historical and forecasted mortgage loan prepayment rates and discount rates 
changes in interest rates  prepayment speeds or other factors could result in impairment of the servicing asset and a charge against earnings to reduce the recorded carrying amount 
based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis  regions estimates that a reduction in the primary mortgage market rates of basis points and basis points would reduce the december  fair value of msr by million and million  respectively 
income taxes management s determination of the realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset 
management believes that the subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits 
regions to consolidated federal income tax returns are open for examination 
from time to time regions engages in business plans that may also have an effect on its tax liabilities 
while regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that the tax aspects of these plans should prevail  examination of regions income tax returns or changes in tax law may impact these plans and resulting provisions for income taxes 
for example  as a result of normal examinations of regions income tax returns  regions has received notices of proposed adjustments relating to taxes due for certain years 
regions believes that adequate provisions for income taxes have been recorded and intends to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments 
to the extent  however  that final resolution of the proposed adjustments results in significantly different conclusions from regions current assessment of the proposed adjustments  regions effective tax rate in any given financial reporting period may be materially different from its current effective tax rate 
acquisitions the acquisitions of banks and other financial service companies historically have contributed significantly to regions growth 
the acquisitions of other financial service companies have also allowed regions to better diversify its revenue stream and to offer additional products and services to its customers 
regions  from time to time  evaluates potential bank and non bank acquisition candidates  however  no transactions were pending at december  during  regions completed acquisitions of an oil and gas valuation and brokerage entity  as well as various insurance production activities 
regions paid approximately million in cash and recorded million in identifiable intangible assets  as well as million of excess purchase price  related to these acquisitions 
on july   regions completed its merger with union planters  headquartered in memphis  tennessee 
union planters provided traditional commercial and retail banking services and other financial services in the fields of mortgage banking  insurance  trust  securities brokerage and investments  professional employment services and specialty financing 
the combination with union planters added billion in assets  billion in loans and billion in deposits  and significantly expanded regions geographic footprint as well as its customer base 
through the merger  regions expanded its banking presence into new markets in illinois  indiana  iowa  kentucky  mississippi and missouri and strengthened its banking presence in existing markets in alabama  arkansas  florida  louisiana  tennessee and texas 
additionally in  regions acquired evergreen timber investment management etim  adding approximately million in assets 
etim manages timber assets for third parties 
in  regions consummated the purchase of three branches from inter savings bank  fsb  which strengthened its community banking franchise in central florida 
these branches combined added million in assets  million in loans and million in deposits 
financial condition regions financial condition depends primarily on the quality and nature of its assets  liabilities and capital structure  market and economic conditions  and the quality of its personnel 
loans and allowance for loan losses loan portfolio regions primary investment is loans 
at december   loans represented of regions earning assets 
lending at regions is generally organized along three functional lines commercial loans including financial and agricultural  real estate loans and consumer loans 
the composition of the portfolio by these major categories is presented below with real estate loans further broken down between construction and mortgage loans december  in thousands  net of unearned income commercial real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer total as the above table demonstrates  over the last five years loans increased a total of billion  a compound growth rate of 
in  total loans increased million  primarily due to growth in the commercial portfolio and partially offset by the reclassification of billion of indirect auto loans to the loans held for sale category on september  excluding the effect of the reclassification  total loans would have increased billion  or  in loans increased billion  or  in  due primarily to growth in the real estate portfolio partially offset by a decline in the commercial portfolio 
loans increased significantly in due to billion of loans which were added by the union planters merger  million of indirect auto loans reclassified to the loan portfolio from the loans held for sale category and internally generated loan growth 
excluding loans added from the merger and reclassification  loans increased in loans increased million  or  in  due primarily to growth in the real estate construction portfolio  partially offset by declines in other loan categories 
all major categories in the loan portfolio have increased significantly over the last five years due primarily to the merger with union planters during over the last five years  commercial  financial and agricultural loans increased billion  or 
real estate construction loans increased billion  or  over the same period 
real estate mortgage loans increased billion  or  and consumer loans increased billion  or  over the last five years 
in  as economic conditions remained relatively steady  loan growth was generated in the real estate construction category  while other categories experienced slight declines 
average total loans were billion in  compared to billion in and billion in the modest internal loan growth trend experienced is the result of reduced loan demand attributable to slowing real estate market conditions  significant prepayments of mortgage loans  and management initiatives to focus on higher margin loans and increase diversification of the portfolio  combined with the reclassification of indirect auto loans in regions anticipates modest overall loan growth in regions residential real estate mortgage loans originated from the mortgage divisions totaled billion at december   an increase of approximately million from a year earlier 
included in these loans are approximately billion of adjustable rate mortgages arm and billion of fixed rate mortgages at year end 
the fixed rate residential mortgage portfolio s weighted average coupon declined to from the previous year  while the weighted average remaining maturity increased slightly to months from months for and  respectively 
the residential arm portfolio exhibited a yield increase with rates averaging in  compared to a year earlier 
at december   the weighted average months to reprice was  down from months at year end the amounts of total gross loans excluding residential mortgages and consumer loans outstanding at december   based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal  due in one year or less  more than one year but less than five years and more than five years  are shown in the following table 
the amounts due after one year are classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
loans maturing within after one but after one year within five years five years total in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage total sensitivity of loans to changes in interest rates predetermined variable rate rate in thousands due after one year but within five years due after five years total a sound credit policy and careful  consistent credit review are vital to a successful lending program 
all affiliates of regions operate under written loan policies that attempt to maintain a consistent lending philosophy  provide sound traditional credit decisions  provide an adequate risk adjusted return and render service to the communities in which the bank branches are located 
regions lending policy generally confines loans to local customers or to national firms doing business locally 
credit reviews and loan examinations help confirm that affiliates are adhering to these loan policies 
allowance for loan losses every loan carries some degree of credit risk 
this risk is reflected in the consolidated financial statements by the allowance for loan losses  the amount of loans charged off and the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense 
it is regions policy that when a loss is identified  it is charged against the allowance for loan losses in the current period 
the policy regarding recognition of losses requires immediate recognition of a loss if significant doubt exists as to principal repayment 
regions provision for loan losses is a reflection of management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
some of the factors considered by management in determining the amount of the provision and resulting allowance include detailed reviews of individual loans  gross and net loan charge offs in the current year  the current level of the allowance in relation to total loans and to historical loss levels  past due and non accruing loans  collateral values of properties securing loans  the composition of the loan portfolio types of loans and risk profiles  and management s analysis of economic conditions and the resulting impact on regions loan portfolio 
a coordinated effort is undertaken to identify credit losses in the loan portfolio for management purposes and to establish the loan loss provision and resulting allowance for accounting purposes 
a regular  formal and ongoing loan review is conducted to identify loans with unusual risks or possible losses 
credit administration and internal audit are jointly responsible for this review  which tests the accuracy of loan gradings assigned at the individual banking offices  reviews significant portfolio segments for early identification of problems or potential problems  and tests for compliance with laws  regulations  and internal policies and procedures 
this process provides information that helps in assessing the quality of the portfolio  assists in the prompt identification of problems and potential problems  and aids in deciding if a loan represents a probable loss that should be recognized or a risk for which an allowance should be maintained 
if it is determined that payment of interest on a loan is questionable  it is regions policy to classify the loan as non accrual and reverse interest previously accrued on the loan against interest income 
interest on such loans is thereafter recorded on a cash basis and is included in earnings only when actually received in cash and when full payment of principal is no longer doubtful 
although it is regions policy to immediately charge off as a loss all loan amounts judged to be uncollectible  historical experience indicates that certain losses exist in the loan portfolio that have not been specifically identified 
to anticipate and provide for these inherent losses  the allowance for loan losses is established by charging the provision for loan losses expense against current earnings 
no portion of the resulting allowance is in any way allocated or restricted to any individual loan or group of loans 
the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans 
regions determines its allowance for loan losses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  management uses information from its ongoing loan review process to stratify the loan portfolio into loan pools with common risk characteristics 
the higher risk graded loans in the portfolio are assigned estimated amounts of loss based on several factors  including current and historical loss experience of each higher risk category  regulatory guidelines for losses in each higher risk category  and management s judgment of economic conditions and the resulting impact on the higher risk graded loans 
all loans deemed to be impaired  which include all non accrual loans greater than million  excluding loans to individuals  are evaluated individually 
impaired loans totaled approximately million at december  and million at december  the vast majority of regions impaired loans are dependent upon collateral for repayment 
for these loans  impairment is measured by evaluating collateral value as compared to the current investment in the loan 
for all other loans  regions compares the amount of estimated discounted cash flows to the investment in the loan 
in the event a particular loan s collateral value or discounted cash flows are not sufficient to support the collection of the investment in the loan  the loan is specifically considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses or a charge is immediately taken against the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses related to the higher risk loans was approximately at december   compared to approximately at december  higher risk loans  which include impaired loans  consist of loans classified as olem other loans especially mentioned and below and loans in other loan categories that are significantly past due 
in addition to establishing allowance levels for specifically identified higher risk graded loans  management determines allowance levels for all other loans in the portfolio for which historical experience indicates that losses exist 
these loans are categorized by loan type and assigned estimated amounts of loss based on several factors  including current and historical loss experience of each loan type and management s judgment of economic conditions and the resulting impact on each category of loans 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses related to all other loans in the portfolio for which historical experience indicates that losses exist was approximately of regions allowance for loan losses at december   compared to approximately at december  the amount of the allowance related to these loans is combined with the amount of the allowance related to the higher risk graded loans to evaluate the overall level of the allowance for loan losses 
in august of  hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast mainly impacting louisiana  mississippi and alabama as a category hurricane  causing significant flood and wind damage and loss of life  property  power  and income 
regions had approximately billion in loans million in commercial real estate loans  million in commercial and industrial loans  million in consumer loans  and million in mortgage loans in the most significantly impacted areas at december  approximately of the consumer loans are home equity lines of credit 
as part of its ongoing evaluation process at december   regions has identified approximately million in allowance for loan losses related to this portion of its loan portfolio 
as of december   regions had recognized approximately  in net loan charge offs  for commercial loans and  for retail and consumer loans related to hurricane katrina 
management considers the current level of allowance for loan losses adequate to absorb probable losses on loans in the portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which is based on the factors and risk identification procedures previously discussed  requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in the future 
changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses related to the hurricane katrina impacted portfolio may change in the future as additional or different information affecting customers in the katrina impacted areas is obtained 
changes in risk assessments of individual loans in this area  collateral values of properties securing loans in this area  levels of past due and non accruing loans in this area  economic conditions in the hurricane katrina impacted area and other factors  could result in changes in regions allowance for loan losses in the future 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  may require that additions be made to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and estimates 
over the last five years  the year end allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans ranged from a low of at december  to a high of at december  and as of december   the allowance as a percentage of loans was

regions expects charge offs to increase slightly in  although additional charge offs could be recognized as a result of higher defaults related to hurricane katrina or the hurricane season in  fraud in connection with loans we originate or lower loan production as a result of rising interest rates

the economies in the markets served by regions continue to be among the best in the nation 
general economic conditions deteriorated throughout the nation in and did not show significant recovery in in  various sectors of the economy reported growth  while others continued the slow growth trends of generally  economic conditions continued to improve during overall economic conditions were generally steady during  despite pressures from rising oil prices and the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita on the gulf coast 
these factors were offset by the continued relatively low interest rate environment  resulting in strong consumer spending  construction  and productivity growth 
commercial 
regions commercial loan portfolio is highly diversified within the markets it serves 
geographically  the largest concentration is the of the commercial loan portfolio in alabama followed by georgia with  tennessee with  florida with  and arkansas with 
commercial loans in louisiana account for of the portfolio  followed by texas and indiana with each  missouri with  illinois and mississippi with each  south carolina with  and iowa  kentucky and north carolina with each 
a small portion of these loans is secured by properties outside regions banking market areas 
included in the commercial loan classification are approximately billion of syndicated loans 
syndicated loans are typically made to national companies and are originated through an agent bank 
regions syndicated loans are primarily to national companies with operations in regions banking footprint 
from to  net commercial loan losses as a percent of average commercial loans outstanding ranged from a low of in to a high of in commercial loan losses in totaled million  or of average commercial loans compared to in the lower percentage of commercial loan losses in compared to resulted primarily from continued positive economic conditions 
future losses are a function of many variables  of which general economic conditions are the most important 
assuming moderate to slow economic growth during in regions market areas and immaterial impact on regions commercial loan portfolio from hurricane katrina  commercial loan losses in are expected to approximate levels 
however  commercial loan losses may be higher than expected in as a result of slower than expected economic growth  unexpected losses from the hurricane season  and our inability to properly assess the credit of borrowers and underlying collateral value due to a number of factors  including environmental and other hazard factors 
real estate 
regions real estate loan portfolio consists of construction and land development loans  loans to businesses for long term financing of land and buildings  loans on one to four family residential properties  loans to mortgage banking companies which are secured primarily by loans on one to four family residential properties and are known as warehoused mortgage loans and various other loans secured by real estate 
real estate construction loans increased billion in to billion  or of regions total loan portfolio 
over the last five years  real estate construction loans averaged of regions total loan portfolio 
during and  construction loan demand declined as the economy exhibited signs of weakness 
in  as the economic conditions improved  loan demand increased as new construction projects increased 
during  construction loan demand increased due to generally strong economic conditions 
most of the construction loans relate to shopping centers  apartment complexes  commercial buildings and residential property development 
these loans are normally secured by land and buildings and are generally backed by commitments for long term financing from other financial institutions 
real estate construction loans are closely monitored by management  since these loans are generally considered riskier than other types of loans and are particularly vulnerable in economic downturns and in periods of high interest rates 
regions generally requires higher levels of borrower equity investment in addition to other underwriting requirements for this type of lending as compared to other real estate lending 
regions has not been an active lender to real estate developers outside its market areas 
the loans to businesses for long term financing of land and buildings are primarily to commercial customers within regions markets 
total loans secured by non farm  non residential properties totaled billion at december  although some risk is inherent in this type of lending  regions attempts to minimize this risk by generally making a significant amount of loans of this type only on owner occupied properties  and by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount  adequate cash flow to service the debt  and in most cases  the personal guarantees of principals of the borrowers 
regions also attempts to mitigate the risks of real estate lending by adhering to standard loan underwriting policies and by diversifying the portfolio both geographically within its market area and within industry groups 
loans on one to four family residential properties  which total approximately of regions real estate mortgage portfolio  are principally on single family residences 
these loans are geographically dispersed throughout regions market areas  and some are guaranteed by government agencies or private mortgage insurers 
historically  this category of loans has not produced sizable loan losses  however  it is subject to some of the same risks as other real estate lending 
warehoused mortgage loans  since they are secured primarily by loans on one to four family residential properties  are similar to these loans in terms of risk 
from to  net losses on real estate loans as a percent of average real estate loans outstanding ranged from a high of in and  to a low of in in  real estate loan losses were relatively flat as compared to these losses depend  to a large degree  on the level of interest rates  economic conditions and collateral values  and thus  are very difficult to predict 
management expects net real estate loan losses to increase slightly above levels

the average contractual maturity of mortgage backed securities was years and the average expected maturity was years 
other securities had an average contractual maturity of years 
overall  the average maturity of the portfolio was years using contractual maturities and years using expected maturities

liquidity general liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of regions and affects regions ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers 
assets  consisting principally of loans and securities  are funded by customer deposits  purchased funds  borrowed funds and stockholders equity 
the securities portfolio is one of regions primary sources of liquidity 
maturities of securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs see previous table on securities maturing

additional funds are provided from payments on consumer loans and one to four family residential mortgage loans 
historically  regions high levels of earnings have also contributed to cash flow 
in addition  liquidity needs can be met by the purchase of funds in state and national money markets 
regions liquidity also continues to be enhanced by a relatively stable deposit base 
the loan to deposit ratio was at december   representing a decrease compared to and at december  and  respectively 
this decrease is the result of deposit growth exceeding loan growth in and as reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows  operating activities provided significant levels of funds in  and  due primarily to high levels of net income

regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market 
regions ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on how effectively the company meets customers needs 
regions employs both traditional and non traditional means to meet customers needs and enhance competitiveness 
the traditional means include providing well designed products  providing a high level of customer service  providing attractive pricing and expanding the traditional branch network to provide convenient branch locations for customers throughout the south  midwest and texas 
regions also employs non traditional approaches to enhance its competitiveness 
these include providing centralized  high quality telephone banking services and alternative product delivery channels such as internet banking 
regions success at competing for deposits is discussed below 
average non interest bearing deposits have increased at a compound growth rate of since this category of deposits grew in  in  and in deposit growth in in this category was primarily attributable to an increase in free checking deposit accounts  the full year impact of deposits added in connection with the union planters merger see above and increases in deposits in areas affected by hurricane katrina

bank regulatory capital requirements regions and regions bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by banking regulatory agencies 
currently  there are two basic measures of capital adequacy a risk based measure and a leverage measure 
the risk based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and financial holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and interest rate risk and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with specified risk weighting factors 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
banking organizations that are considered to have excessive interest rate risk exposure are required to maintain additional capital 
the minimum standard for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
at least of that capital level must consist of common equity  undivided profits and non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other intangibles tier capital 
the remainder tier capital may consist of a limited amount of other preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 
the banking regulatory agencies also have adopted regulations that supplement the risk based guidelines to include a minimum ratio of of tier capital to average assets less goodwill the leverage ratio 
depending upon the risk profile of the institution and other factors  the regulatory agencies may require a leverage ratio of to above the minimum level 
the following chart summarizes the applicable bank regulatory capital requirements 
regions capital ratios at december   substantially exceeded all regulatory requirements 
minimum well capitalized regions at regulatory regulatory december  requirement requirement tier capital to risk adjusted assets total risk based capital to risk adjusted assets tier leverage ratio at december   tier capital totaled billion  total risk based capital totaled billion and risk adjusted assets totaled billion 
total capital at regions bank also has an important effect on the amount of fdic insurance premiums paid

net interest income increased in and in on a taxable equivalent basis  net interest income increased in and in the following table analysis of changes in net interest income provides additional information to analyze the changes in net interest income 
regions measures its ability to produce net interest income with a ratio called the interest margin 
the interest margin is net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets 
the interest margin increased from in to in to in changes in the interest margin occur primarily due to two factors the interest rate spread the difference between the taxable equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate on interest bearing liabilities and the percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
the first factor affecting regions interest margin is the interest rate spread 
regions average interest rate spread was in  in and in market interest rates  both the level of rates and the slope of the yield curve the spread between short term rates and longer term rates  affect the interest rate spread by influencing the pricing on most categories of regions interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
after reducing the federal funds rate significantly in  the federal reserve board reduced the federal funds rate basis points in and basis points in as the economy experienced growth  the fed increased the federal funds rate five times totaling basis points in the second half of in  the fed increased the federal funds rate eight times totaling basis points in response to economic growth and inflation concerns 
these increases resulted in a federal funds rate of at december  regions interest earning asset yields and interest bearing liability rates were both higher in as compared to  reflecting increased average market interest rates in in  regions interest earning asset yields increased basis points while interest bearing liability rates increased basis points  resulting in an increased interest rate spread compared to the mix of earning assets can also affect the interest rate spread 
during  loans  which are typically regions most significant and highest yielding earning asset  increased as a percentage of earning assets 
this increase contributed to higher earning asset yields 
average loans as a percentage of earning assets was in and in during and  regions used interest rate derivatives as cash flow and fair value hedges of certain asset and liability positions 
these contracts had the effect of increasing net interest income by million in and million in the second factor affecting the interest margin is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
funding for regions earning assets comes from interest bearing liabilities  non interest bearing liabilities and stockholders equity 
the net spread on earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities and stockholders equity is higher than the net spread on earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
the percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities was in  in and in this decline positively impacted the net interest margin as compared to prior years 
in the future  management expects that an increasing percentage of funding will be provided from interest bearing liabilities 
higher spreads  combined with significant growth in average interest earning assets from full year impact of the union planters merger in  resulted in higher net interest income in the increase in net interest income for was due to higher spreads  combined with significant growth in interest earning assets due to the union planters merger 
in  regions anticipates moderate compression of the net interest margin as short term rate increases begin to slow and the benefit from the re pricing lag for deposits diminishes 
in addition  if interest rates continue to rise in  the demand for loans and other interest earning assets will generally be reduced which could adversely impact regions earnings by putting further pressure on the compression of the interest margin

market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices  or the credit quality of debt securities 
interest rate sensitivity regions primary market risk is interest rate risk  including uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as uncertainty with respect to relative interest rate levels which impact both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves affecting the financial products and services that the company offers 
to quantify this risk  regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios as compared to a base case scenario 
net interest income sensitivity as measured over months is a useful short term indicator of regions interest rate risk 
sensitivity measurement 
financial simulation models are regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure 
using a wide range of hypothetical deterministic and stochastic simulations  these tools provide management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
these models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions balance sheet 
assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates  the slope of the yield curve  and the changing composition of the balance sheet that result from both strategic plans and from customer behavior 
among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition  the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business 
interest rate related risks are expressly considered  such as pricing spreads  the lag time in pricing administered rate accounts  prepayments and other option risks 
regions considers these factors  as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior 
financial derivative instruments are used in hedging the values of selected assets and liabilities against changes in interest rates 
the effect of these hedges is included in the simulations of net interest income 
the primary objectives of asset liability management at regions are balance sheet coordination and the management of interest rate risk in achieving reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles 
a standard set of alternate interest rate scenarios is compared to the results of the base case scenario to determine the extent of potential fluctuations and to establish exposure limits 
the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and minus and basis points 
in addition  regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements that may more realistically mimic potential interest rate movements 
the gradual scenarios include curve steepening  flattening  and parallel movements of various magnitudes phased in over a month period 
exposure to interest rate movements 
based on the foregoing discussion  management has estimated the potential effect of shifts in interest rates on net interest income 
as of december   regions maintained a slight asset sensitive position to a gradual rate shift of plus or minus or basis points 
the following table demonstrates the expected effect that a gradual over six months beginning at december  and  respectively parallel interest rate shift would have on regions net interest income

change in change in change in change in net interest net interest net interest net interest instantaneous change in interest rates income income income income dollar amounts in thousands in basis points derivatives regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity 
the asset and liability committee  in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity  approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies 
the most common derivatives the company employs are interest rate swaps  interest rate options  forward sale commitments  interest rate and foreign exchange forward contracts and credit default swaps 
interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable streams of interest payments 
the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of the interest payments 
interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a pre determined price and time 
forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell money market instruments at a future date for an already agreed upon price 
foreign exchange forwards are contractual agreements to receive or deliver a foreign currency at an agreed upon future date and price 
credit default swaps are contractual agreements between counterparties whereby one party pays the other at a fixed periodic rate for the specified life of the agreement 
the other party makes no payments unless a specified credit event occurs 
credit events are typically defined to include a material default  bankruptcy or debt restructuring for a specified reference asset 
if such a credit event occurs  the party makes a payment to the first party  and the swap then terminates 
regions has made use of interest rate swaps and interest rate options to convert a portion of its fixed rate funding position to a variable rate position 
regions also uses derivatives to manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business 
futures contracts and forward sales commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing 
in the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans  changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held for sale portfolio 
futures and forward sale commitment positions are used to protect the company from the risk of such adverse changes 
futures contracts are also used to hedge the risks associated with customer derivatives 
the change in value of the hedging contracts is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the change in value of specific assets and liabilities over the life of the hedge relationship 
regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers 
interest rate swaps  interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers 
positions with similar characteristics are used to offset the market risk and minimize income statement volatility associated with this portfolio 
those instruments used to service customers are entered into the trading account with changes in value recorded in the income statement 
refer to note derivative financial instruments and hedging activities of the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of regions year end derivatives positions in the trading portfolio 
the objective of regions hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes  from an economic and accounting perspective  on net interest income and the net present value of our balance sheet 
the overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions  the quality of regions execution  the accuracy of its asset valuation assumptions  counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates 
as a result  regions hedging strategies may be ineffective in mitigating the impact of interest rate changes on its earnings 
brokerage and market making activity morgan keegan s business activities expose it to market risk  including its securities inventory positions and securities held for investment 
morgan keegan trades for its own account in corporate and tax exempt securities and us government  agency and guaranteed securities 
most of these transactions are entered into to facilitate the execution of customers orders to buy or sell these securities 
in addition  it trades certain equity securities in order to make a market in these securities 
morgan keegan s trading activities require the commitment of capital 
all principal transactions place the subsidiary s capital at risk 
profits and losses are dependent upon the skills of employees and market fluctuations 
in some cases  in order to economically hedge the risks of carrying inventory  morgan keegan enters into a low level of activity involving us treasury note futures 
morgan keegan  as part of its normal brokerage activities  assumes short positions on securities 
the establishment of short positions exposes morgan keegan to off balance sheet risk in the event that prices increase  as it may be obligated to cover such positions at a loss 
morgan keegan manages its exposure to these instruments by entering into offsetting or other positions in a variety of financial instruments 
morgan keegan will occasionally economically hedge a portion of its long proprietary inventory position through the use of short positions in financial future contracts  which are included in securities sold  not yet purchased at market value 
at december   morgan keegan had no outstanding futures contracts 
in the normal course of business  morgan keegan enters into underwriting and forward and future commitments 
at december   the contract amounts of futures contracts were million to purchase and million to sell us government and municipal securities 
morgan keegan typically settles its position by entering into equal but opposite contracts and  as such  the contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
settlement of the transactions relating to such commitments are not expected to have a material effect on regions consolidated financial position 
transactions involving future settlement give rise to market risk  which represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial instrument 
regions exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors  including the size  composition and diversification of positions held  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates  and market volatility 
additionally  in the normal course of business  morgan keegan enters into transactions for delayed delivery  to be announced securities which are recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition at fair value 
risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from unfavorable changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities underlying the instruments 
the credit risk associated with these contracts is typically limited to the cost of replacing all contracts on which the company has recorded an unrealized gain 
for exchange traded contracts  the clearing organization acts as the counterparty to specific transactions and  therefore  bears the risk of delivery to and from counterparties 
interest rate risk at morgan keegan arises from the exposure of holding interest sensitive financial instruments such as government  corporate and municipal bonds and certain preferred equities 
morgan keegan manages its exposure to interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and  where feasible  entering into offsetting positions in securities with similar interest rate risk characteristics 
securities inventories are marked to market  and accordingly there are no unrecorded gains or losses in value 
while a significant portion of the securities inventories have contractual maturities in excess of five years  these inventories  on average  turn over in excess of twelve times per year 
accordingly  the exposure to interest rate risk inherent in morgan keegan s securities inventories is less than that of similar financial instruments held by firms in other industries 
morgan keegan s equity securities inventories are exposed to risk of loss in the event of unfavorable price movements 
the equity securities inventories are marked to market and there are no unrecorded gains or losses 
morgan keegan is also subject to credit risk arising from non performance by trading counterparties  customers  and issuers of debt securities owned 
this risk is managed by imposing and monitoring position limits  monitoring trading counterparties  reviewing security concentrations  holding and marking to market collateral and conducting business through clearing organizations that guarantee performance 
morgan keegan regularly participates in the trading of some derivative securities for its customers  however  this activity does not involve morgan keegan acquiring a position or commitment in these products and this trading is not a significant portion of morgan keegan s business 
to manage trading risks arising from interest rate and equity price risks  regions uses a value at risk var model to measure the potential fair value the company could lose on its trading positions given a specified statistical confidence level and time to liquidate time horizon 
regions assesses market risk at a confidence level over a one day holding period 
regions primary var model is based upon a variance covariance approach with delta gamma approximations for non linear securities 
the end of period var was approximately  as of december   and approximately  as of december  maximum daily var utilization during was million and average daily var during the same period was  provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is used to establish the allowance for loan losses 
actual loan losses  net of recoveries  are charged directly to the allowance 
the expense recorded each year is a reflection of management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance 
for an analysis and discussion of the allowance for loan losses  refer to the section entitled financial condition loans and allowance for loan losses 
during  the provision for loan losses increased to million of average loans due to higher loan losses  slightly higher past dues  and management s evaluation of current economic factors  including the impact of hurricane katrina 
the resulting year end allowance for loan losses increased million to million 
and provisions for loan losses were million of average loans and million of average loans  respectively 
non interest income non interest income excluding security transactions totaled billion in  compared to billion in and billion in the increase in non interest income is due primarily to fee income added by the union planters merger in mid non interest income excluding security transactions as a percent of total revenue equaled in  compared to in and in non interest income has declined as a percent of total revenue due to much faster growth in net interest income over the last three years  compared to the growth in non interest income 
acquisition activity in recent periods has added significantly more net interest income in comparison to non interest income added to the total revenue stream 
brokerage and investment banking brokerage and investment income increased and totaled million in  compared to million in and million in brokerage and investment income is significantly affected by economic and market conditions 
the increase in brokerage and investment income in resulted from strong private client  equity capital markets  trust  and investment advisory income streams in as of december   morgan keegan employed slightly more than  financial advisors 
customer assets under management totaled approximately billion at year end  compared to approximately billion at year end morgan keegan contributed million to net income in revenues from the private client division totaled million  or of morgan keegan s total revenue in  and was the top revenue producing line of business 
this line of business benefited from improved equity markets in fixed income capital markets and equity capital markets revenue totaled million and million  in  respectively 
the investment advisory services division produced million of revenue in revenues generated by each division are included in various line items in the following table 
regions morgan keegan trust division  which produced revenue of million in  is included with morgan keegan 
although regions morgan keegan trust division is included with morgan keegan  all trust income is reported as a separate item in the consolidated statements of income see next section titled trust income for discussion of changes in trust income 
the following table shows the components of the contribution by morgan keegan for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands revenues commissions principal transactions investment banking interest trust fees and services investment advisory other total revenues expense interest expense non interest expense total expenses income before taxes income taxes net income the following table shows the breakout of revenue by division contributed by morgan keegan for the years ended december   and morgan keegan breakout of revenue by division year ended december  fixed income equity private capital capital regions investment interest client markets markets mk trust advisory and other dollar amounts in thousands gross revenue percent of gross revenue gross revenue percent of gross revenue gross revenue percent of gross revenue trust income trust income increased in  in and in the increase in was driven by higher asset values  increased fees  and a full year of activity from trust accounts added through the union planters merger in the third quarter of in  and  better performance in the financial markets and increases in trust assets contributed to higher trust fees 
service charges on deposit accounts service charge income increased in  in and in the addition of new accounts added in connection with the union planters transaction during the third quarter of  partially offset by the expanded offering of free checking products were the primary reasons for the increases in and in comparison with prior years 
also negatively impacting service charges on deposits were deferrals or waivers of certain fees in the impacted areas of hurricane katrina during the third and fourth quarters of increases in the number of deposit accounts  management initiatives and standardization in the pricing of certain deposit accounts and related services were the primary drivers of increases in mortgage servicing and origination fees the primary source of this category of income is regions mortgage banking divisions  regions mortgage and equifirst 
regions mortgage s primary business and source of income is the origination and servicing of mortgage loans for long term investors 
equifirst typically originates mortgage loans which are sold to third party investors with servicing released 
net gains or losses related to the sale of mortgage loans are included in other non interest income 
in  mortgage servicing and origination fees increased  from million in to million in origination and servicing fees increased in due to increased origination volume and servicing assets added from the union planters merger partially offset by a reduction in serviced loans 
at december   regions servicing portfolio totaled billion and included approximately  loans 
at december  and  the servicing portfolio totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the decrease in the servicing portfolio in resulted primarily from the sale of the conforming wholesale mortgage unit during the second quarter of the increase in the servicing portfolio in resulted from the addition of the union planters mortgage division  partially offset by certain divestitures of out of footprint mortgage servicing rights and a relatively high level of prepayments 
the decline in the servicing portfolio during resulted from high levels of prepayments due to the low interest rate environment driving record mortgage refinance activity  partially offset by higher levels of production in in  mortgage servicing and origination fees increased to million 
origination and servicing fees increased in due to volume and servicing assets added from the union planters merger 
in  mortgage servicing and origination fees increased  to million 
origination fees increased in due to the significant mortgage activity resulting from the historically low interest rate environment 
servicing fees were lower in  as compared to the prior year  due to a smaller servicing portfolio in regions mortgage and equifirst  through their retail  correspondent lending and wholesale operations  produced mortgage loans totaling billion in  billion in and billion in regions mortgage and equifirst produce loans from offices in alabama  arizona  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  iowa  kentucky  louisiana  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee and texas 
a summary of mortgage servicing rights is presented as follows 
the balances shown represent the original amounts capitalized  less accumulated amortization and valuation adjustments  for the right to service mortgage loans that are owned by other investors 
the amortization of mortgage servicing rights is included in other non interest expense 
the carrying values of mortgage servicing rights are affected by various factors  including prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
a significant change in prepayments of mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in the valuation adjustments 
in thousands balance at beginning of year added in connection with acquisition sale of servicing assets amounts capitalized amortization valuation allowance balance at end of year the mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance decreased by million in  due to a rise in mortgage rates  resulting in a decline in prepayment speeds 
in contrast  the mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance increased by million during  due to a low mortgage rate environment  resulting in increased prepayment speeds and increased refinancing activity 
see further discussion in other expenses below 
securities losses gains regions reported net losses of million from the sale of available for sale securities in  as compared to net gains of million in and million in these gains and losses were primarily related to the sale of agency and mortgage related securities in conjunction with balance sheet management activities 
other income the components of other income consisted mainly of fees and commissions  insurance premiums  customer derivative fees  and net gains related to the sale of mortgage loans 
fees and commission income increased in  due primarily to a full year of business activity related to the union planters merger in  including atm switch income  international income  and fees related to money orders  cashier checks  and other banking fees 
fee and commission income increased in due to increased business activity related to the union planters merger including standby letters of credit  credit card fees  money orders  cashiers checks and other banking fees 
insurance premium and commission income decreased in  due primarily to a decrease in miscellaneous insurance commissions  but increased in  due primarily to increased revenues in the commercial property and casualty business 
regions customer derivative division primarily assists existing commercial customers with capital market products including interest rate swaps  caps and floors 
typically  regions enters into offsetting derivative positions limiting its exposure related to customer derivative products 
these exposures are marked to market on a daily basis 
capital market income totaled million in  million in and million in customer derivative division revenue increased in as penetration of the legacy union planters customer base continued to produce sales of customer derivative products and as customers swapped floating rate loans for fixed rate loans in a flattening yield curve environment 
in  net gains related to the sale of mortgage loans held for sale totaled million million related to equifirst and million related to regions mortgage 
the increase of million in gains during was primarily related to higher sales volume at equifirst during the year 
for the years ended december  and  gains totaled million and million  respectively 
non interest expense the main components of non interest expense are salaries and employee benefits  net occupancy expense  furniture and equipment expenses and other non interest expense 
the following table presents a summary of non interest expense for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands salaries and employee benefits net occupancy expense furniture and equipment expense other expenses total total non interest expense increased million  or  in and million  or  in  due primarily to the expense base added in connection with the union planters merger  which occurred mid year in  total non interest expense increased  due primarily to increased levels of business activity and new branch offices 
also impacting comparisons between periods are merger related expenses  impairment charges related to mortgage servicing rights including recapture of previously recognized impairment charges  losses related to prepayment of debt and storm related costs 
the following tables show the impact on the major non interest expense components  excluding merger related expenses  impairment charges recapture for mortgage servicing assets  losses for prepayment of debt and storm related costs 
management believes the following tables are useful in evaluating trends in non interest expense 
for further discussion of non interest expense  refer to the following discussion of each component of non interest expense 
non interest expense less merger related  debt retirement  msr recapture  and storm related as reported charges as adjusted in thousands salaries and employee benefits net occupancy expense furniture and equipment expense other expenses total in  merger and storm related charges totaled million  impairment recapture on mortgage servicing rights totaled million and losses on early extinguishment of debt million of federal home loan bank structured notes totaled million 
during  regions received a million advance from its insurance carrier for claims expected to be filed in connection with the damage from hurricane katrina 
this advance was used to partially offset expenses incurred in connection with hurricane katrina 
the advance was included in the operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
regions recorded approximately million in net storm related expenses during in connection with the integration of regions and union planters  regions has incurred merger related expenses throughout the integration process 
merger related expenses include costs incurred in connection with the merger  integration and restructuring activities  including retention and severance costs  professional fees incurred with integration activities  contract buyouts  lease termination penalties  loss on disposals of duplicate facilities and other direct and incremental costs related to the transaction

excluding million of merger related charges  salaries and benefits increased in due to the above noted items 
salaries and benefits were higher in  as compared to the prior year  due primarily to higher incentive costs associated with morgan keegan  equifirst  and regions mortgage  as well as normal merit and promotional adjustments 
at december   regions had approximately  full time equivalent employees  compared to approximately  at december  and approximately  at december  the decrease in full time equivalent employees from december  to december  was related to streamlined processes  converted systems  and normal attrition  the increase in employees in resulted primarily from personnel added with the union planters transaction 
salaries  excluding benefits  totaled million in  compared to million in and million in salaries increased in primarily as a result of an increase in full year headcount in connection with the union planters merger 
increased salaries in resulted from higher employment levels in connection with the union planters merger  while higher salary levels in were primarily the result of normal merit and promotional adjustments

please refer to note other income and expense to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the significant components of other expense 
legal and other professional fees increased during  primarily due to integration activities undertaken and a full year of expenses added in connection with the union planters merger in july of legal and other professional fees increased significantly in  as compared to and  due to costs incurred related to the merger and integration with union planters 
these costs include fees paid to attorneys  accountants and other professionals involved in the union planters transaction as well as costs incurred in the ordinary course of business 
other non credit losses primarily include charges for items unrelated to the extension of credit such as fraud losses  litigation losses  write downs of other real estate  insurance claims and other miscellaneous losses 
other non credit losses increased in  primarily due to increased write downs in other real estate  as well as increases in fraud  litigation and miscellaneous losses 
other non credit losses increased in due to higher losses related to litigation  fraud and other expenses related to increased business activity added by the union planters merger 
the decrease was primarily related to lower losses related to litigation 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights increased in  primarily due to full year amortization on the servicing rights added in connection with the union planters merger in july accelerated amortization expense  due to the low interest rate environment and increased prepayments of underlying mortgages  combined with the addition of servicing rights added by the union planters merger  resulted in additional amortization expense in and during  regions recognized a million recapture on impairment of mortgage servicing rights  due to rising mortgage rates and reduced prepayment speed assumptions related to the serviced mortgages 
regions recognized million of impairment in as mortgage rates declined  refinancing activity increased  and prepayment speeds increased 
regions recognized million in recapture of impairment during  resulting from a slight decrease in prepayment speeds from modest increases in mortgage rates 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased significantly in and the increase was related to amortization of intangible assets primarily core deposit intangibles recorded in connection with the union planters merger 
during  regions incurred a million charge on the early extinguishment of million of fhlb structured notes classified in long term debt 
during  regions incurred a million charge on the early extinguishment of billion of long term federal home loan bank advances 
during  in connection with the prepayment of million of federal home loan bank advances  regions incurred a million loss on early extinguishment of debt 
applicable income tax regions provision for income taxes for increased million compared to due primarily to increased earnings resulting from the merger with union planters and increased consolidated earnings in  offset by both an increase in tax credits and increased benefits from the recapitalized mortgage related subsidiary further described below 
regions effective tax rate for was  compared to for and for from time to time regions engages in business plans that may also have an effect on its tax liabilities 
while regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that the tax aspects of these strategies should prevail  examination of regions income tax returns or changes in tax law may impact the tax benefits of these plans 
periodically  regions invests in pass through investment vehicles that generate tax credits  principally low income housing credits and non conventional fuel source credits  which directly reduce regions federal income tax liability 
congress has legislated these tax credit programs to encourage capital inflows to these investment vehicles 
the amount of tax benefit recognized from these tax credits was million in  compared to million in during the fourth quarter of  regions recapitalized a mortgage related subsidiary by raising tier capital  which resulted in a reduction in taxable income of that subsidiary attributable to regions 
the reduction in the taxable income of this subsidiary attributable to regions is expected to result in a lower effective tax rate applicable to the consolidated taxable income before taxes of regions for future periods 
the impact on regions effective tax rate applicable to consolidated income before taxes of the reduction in the subsidiary s taxable income attributable to regions will  however  depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the amount of assets in the subsidiary  the yield of the assets in the subsidiary  the cost of funding the subsidiary  possible loan losses in the subsidiary  the level of expenses of the subsidiary  the level of income attributable to obligations of states and political subdivisions  and various other factors 
the amount of federal and state tax benefits recognized related to the recapitalized subsidiary was million in million federal compared to million in million federal 
regions has segregated a portion of its investment securities and intellectual property into separate legal entities in order to  among other business purposes  protect such intangible assets from inappropriate claims of regions creditors  and to maximize the return on such assets by the professional and focused management thereof 
regions has recognized state tax benefits related to these legal entities of million in compared to million in regions federal and state income tax returns for the years through are open for review and examination by governmental authorities 
in the normal course of these examinations  regions is subject to challenges from governmental authorities regarding amounts of taxes due 
regions has received notices of proposed adjustments relating to taxes due for the years through  which include proposed adjustments relating to an increase in taxable income of the mortgage related subsidiary discussed above 
regions believes adequate provision for income taxes has been recorded for all years open for review and intends to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments 
to the extent that final resolution of the proposed adjustments results in significantly different conclusions from regions current assessment of the proposed adjustments  regions effective tax rate in any given financial reporting period may be materially different from its current effective tax rate 
management s determination of the realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing  nature and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset 
management believes that the subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits 
however  management does not believe that it is more likely than not to realize all of its capital loss carryforwards nor all of its state net operating loss carryforwards 
accordingly  it has valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  against such benefits 
note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information about the provision for income taxes 
effects of inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is regions ability to react to changes in interest rates 
as discussed previously  management is attempting to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations
