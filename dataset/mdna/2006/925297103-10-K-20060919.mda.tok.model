item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial trends from fiscal year to  the net service revenue of the company declined as the company wound down the army stepo suit production contract in the national security business segment 
with increased funded contract backlog in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the first quarter of fiscal year  the company began to reverse that trend 
multi million dollar contracts were awarded to the infrastructure and management services business segment 
these included roofing projects in san diego in support of the defense logistic agency and hurricane emergency response in various locations in florida 
the company achieved significant gross revenue growth in the first half of fiscal year as a result of increased infrastructure and management services work 
during the second half of fiscal year  gross revenues on major construction projects declined compared to the first half of the year due to delays in obtaining follow on and new projects 
the company also experienced delays in contract funding from the epa and other civilian agencies 
the resulting reduction in gross revenues along with the delay in resolution of several construction change orders negatively impacted the company s operating results in the second half of fiscal year in fiscal year  the company discontinued the operations of its biological laboratory primarily due to poor operating performance  market saturation and an uncertain business outlook 
such results were presented as discontinued operations for financial statement purposes and the assets and liabilities were segregated for financial reporting purposes 
in fiscal year  the company s gross revenues declined primarily due to the continuation of federal government delays in funding  which in certain instances  spanned as much as nine months and the continued diversion of funding to the war in iraq 
the company adapted to the funding shifts by expanding its services in iraq work under existing contracts and seeking new contract work in iraq 
by the end of fiscal year  the project funding began to return to normal levels and increased the company s funded backlog by to million 
the company anticipates that with improved level of project funding  the anticipated backlog and gross revenues will increase in excess of in fiscal year however  such growth is dependent upon winning additional follow on projects and additional new contracts in order to keep the funded contract backlog at levels that would support continued growth 
management continues to pursue many business opportunities to continue such growth

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations versar s gross revenue for fiscal year totaled  a  decrease compared to gross revenue of  for fiscal year gross revenue for fiscal year increased by  over that reported in fiscal year the decrease in gross revenue in fiscal year was primarily attributable to delays in construction contract awards in the company s infrastructure and management services business segment 
a number of these awards were made late in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the increase in gross revenue in fiscal year was due to increased construction work primarily in the first half of fiscal year managing the construction cycles  timing  and funding by the federal government is difficult especially with the country s commitments in iraq and delays created in funding of other projects 
this was further discussed under the heading financial trends 
purchased services and materials for fiscal year totaled  a  decrease over that reported in fiscal year purchased services and materials for fiscal year increased by  over that reported in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year was due to a decline in subcontracted construction work in the infrastructure and management services business segment as mentioned above as a result of delays in contract funding and fewer large construction projects 
the increase in fiscal year was primarily due to the increased subcontractor work that related to the increase in construction projects discussed above 
net service revenue is derived by deducting the costs of purchased services from gross revenue 
versar considers it appropriate to analyze operating margins and other ratios in relation to net service revenue  because such revenues reflect the actual work performed by the company s labor force 
net service revenue decreased by in fiscal year  primarily due to the reduced subcontractor cost mark up on lower purchased services and materials during fiscal year net service revenue increased by in fiscal year due to higher labor generated revenues and increased subcontracted costs during the year 
direct costs of service and overhead include direct and overhead staff  including recoverable and unallowable costs that are directly attributable to contracts 
the percentage of these costs to net service revenue increased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the increase in the percentage in fiscal year is due to lower profit margins in the company s infrastructure and management services business segment in which the company recorded lower revenue as a result of delays in construction project funding due to the funding requirements of the war in iraq and a  project overrun 
project funding started to become available late in the fourth quarter of fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses approximated of net service revenue in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the decrease is due to cost reduction efforts early in fiscal year as a result of reduced business volume of the company 
the increase in fiscal year was the result of higher marketing costs  sarbanes oxley compliance costs and external consultant marketing costs 
in fiscal year  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  for terminating a long term lease in versar s northeast regional office 
such costs were recorded due to a business downturn in that office  as a result of the brac closures 
this lease was terminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year operating income for fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the decrease in operating income is primarily due to the decline in gross revenues and the increase in direct costs of services and overhead in fiscal year the decrease in operating income in fiscal year was due to the restructuring charge  higher selling  general and administrative costs and an unresolved contract dispute during fiscal year interest expense  net during fiscal year was  a decrease of  from fiscal year the decrease is due to minimal use of the company s line of credit and interest income from cash in the bank and interest item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income from the resolution of a disputed receivable in fiscal year in fiscal year  interest expenses decreased by  as a result of reduced borrowing on the company s line of credit 
an income tax benefit of  was recorded in fiscal year primarily as a result of the contract awards obtained during the third quarter and the reduction of several long term future lease obligations for the company 
such improvements in the company s contract backlog and reduced fixed costs increased the likelihood that the company s deferred tax assets would be utilized in future years based upon management s assessment of the ability to derive the benefit of the asset 
the company has approximately million in deferred tax assets of which a million valuation allowance has been established against such assets 
management provides for a valuation allowance until such time as it can conclude more likely than not that the company will derive a benefit from such assets 
the valuation allowance is adjusted as necessary based upon the company s ability to generate taxable income  including management s ability to implement tax strategies that will enable the company to benefit from such deferred tax assets 
income from continuing operations for fiscal year was  compared to  the increase is due to the income tax benefit recorded in fiscal year as mentioned above 
income from continuing operations in fiscal year decreased by  over that reported in fiscal year due to the restructuring charge recorded in fiscal year and the contract dispute referenced above 
loss from discontinued operations in fiscal year was  compared to a loss of  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the loss recorded in fiscal year resulted from additional benefit obligations associated with the smc pension plan 
the losses recorded in fiscal years and were the result of the company s discontinuance of its biological laboratory operations due to the lack of business volume  market concentration  and poor operating performance 
in summary  versar s net income for the fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year revenue versar provides professional services to various industries  serving government and commercial clients 
a summary of revenue generated from the company s client base is as follows for the years ended june  july  june  in thousands  except for percentages government epa state local department of defense other commercial gross revenue item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the increase in department of defense and other government revenues were primarily due to the two iraq projects performed during fiscal year such increases were in part offset by the completion of several construction projects during the year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital as of june  approximated  an increase of  
in addition  the company s current ratio at june  was  compared to reported on july  the improved current ratio was attributed to the increase in receivables and the decrease in the utilization of the line of credit during the year 
the company has a line of credit facility with united bank the bank that provides for advances up to  based upon qualifying receivables 
interest on borrowings is based on the prime rate of interest as of june  
as of june   there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 
obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by the company and each subsidiary individually and collectively secured by accounts receivable  equipment and intangibles  plus all insurance policies on property constituting collateral 
the credit facility matures in november the line of credit is subject to certain covenants related to the maintenance of financial ratios 
these covenants require a minimum tangible net worth of  a maximum total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to  and a minimum current ratio of at least to failure to meet the covenant requirements gives the bank the right to demand outstanding amounts due under the line of credit  which may impact the company s ability to finance its working capital requirements 
at june   the company was in compliance with such financial covenants 
the company believes that borrowing capacity on the line of credit  together with anticipated cash flows from operations  are sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs for the next year 
there can be no assurance  however  that amounts available in the future from existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet future capital needs 
contractual obligations at june   the company had unfunded contractual payment obligations of approximately  due within the next twelve months

information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenue recognition contracts in process are stated at the lower of actual costs incurred plus accrued profits or net estimated realizable value of costs  reduced by progress billings 
on cost plus fee contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned  and on time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
the company records income from major fixed price contracts  extending over more than one accounting period  using the percentage of completion method 
during the performance of such contracts  estimated final contract prices and costs are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
fixed price contracts can be significantly impacted by changes in contract performance  contract delays  liquidated damages and penalty provisions  and contract change orders  which may affect the revenue recognition on a project 
losses on contracts are recognized in the period when they become known 
there is the possibility that there will be future and currently unforeseeable significant adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and margins for fixed price contracts  particularly in the later stages of these contracts 
it is likely that such adjustments could occur with our larger fixed priced projects 
such adjustments are common in the construction industry given the nature of the contracts 
these adjustments could either positively or negatively impact our estimates due to the circumstances surrounding the negotiations of change orders  the impact of schedule slippage  subcontractor claims and contract disputes which are normally resolved at the end of the contract 
adjustments to the financial statements are made when they are known 
allowance for doubtful accounts disputes arise in the normal course of the company s business on projects where the company is contesting with customers for collection of funds because of events such as delays  changes in contract specifications and questions of cost allowability or collectibility 
such disputes  whether claims or unapproved change orders in process of negotiation  are recorded at the lesser of their estimated net realizable value or actual costs incurred and only when realization is probable and can be reliably estimated 
claims against the company are recognized where loss is considered probable and reasonably determinable in amount 
management reviews outstanding receivables on a regular basis and assesses the need for reserves  taking into consideration past collection history and other events that bear on the collectibility of such receivables 
deferred tax valuation allowance the company has approximately million in deferred tax assets of which a million valuation allowance has been established against such assets 
management provides for a valuation allowance until such time as it can conclude more likely than not that the company will derive a benefit from such assets 
the valuation allowance is adjusted as necessary based upon the company s ability to generate taxable income  including management s ability to implement tax strategies that will enable the company to benefit from such deferred tax assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets on january   versar completed the acquisition of the greenwood partnership  pc subsequently renamed versar global solutions  inc or vgsi 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase 
goodwill resulting from this transaction was approximately million 
in fiscal year  the company adopted the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which eliminated the amortization of goodwill  but requires the company to test such goodwill for impairment annually 
currently  the carrying value of goodwill is approximately  relating to the acquisition of vgsi  which is now part of the infrastructure and management services ims reporting unit 
the ims business segment was combined with the engineering and construction business segment during fiscal year because many of the services provided were similar to the company s remediation business  the business shared similar customers  and business opportunities  and were duplicative in nature 
such a combination provided a more efficient use of resources and more effective management of the business operations 
in performing its goodwill impairment analysis  management has utilized a market based valuation approach to determine the estimated fair value of the ims reporting unit 
management engages outside professionals and valuation experts  as necessary  to assist in performing this analysis 
an analysis was performed on public companies and company transactions to prepare a market based valuation 
based upon the analysis  the estimated fair value of the ims reporting unit was million which exceeds the carrying value of the net assets by a substantial margin 
should the ims reporting unit financial performance not meet estimates  then impairment of goodwill would have to be further assessed to determine whether a write down of goodwill value would be warranted 
if such a write down were to occur  it would negatively impact the company s item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued financial position and results of operations 
however  it would not impact the company s cash flow or financial debt covenants 
during fiscal years and  management concluded  based upon its impairment analysis  that goodwill relating to the infrastructure and management services reporting unit was not impaired 
on april   the company acquired the cultural resources group from parsons infrastructure technology group  inc  a subsidiary of parsons corporation for a purchase price of approximately  in cash 
the cultural resources group  based in fairfax county  virginia provides archaeological  cultural and historical services to federal  state and municipal clients across the country 
the acquisition expanded the company s existing and future capabilities in cultural resources work enhancing and complimenting versar s environmental core business

the closing price of the company s common stock on the american stock exchange on june   the date the options were accelerated  was 
the acceleration of the out of the money options was done in order to avoid the impact of adoption of fas r 
certain non qualified stock options were not subject to the acceleration 
based on the potential for the options subject to acceleration to have value over their remaining terms  the company reduced the stock option expense it otherwise would have been required to recognize in its consolidated statements of income by approximately  over the next four years on a pre tax basis 
in fiscal year  the company adopted fas r and recorded stock based compensation expense in its consolidated financial statements of approximately  the impact on basic and diluted net income per common share was
