the following discussion and analysis of the historical consolidated financial statements of the company should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k

table of contents overview the company is a holding company with operations being conducted by subsidiaries 
our specialty property and casualty insurance operations are licensed in all states  the district of columbia and the cayman islands 
we generate underwriting profits by providing what we view as specialized insurance products  services and programs not generally available in the marketplace 
while many companies write property and casualty insurance for transportation companies  we believe that few write passenger transportation coverage nationwide and very few write coverage for several of the classes of passenger transportation insurance written by the company and its subsidiaries 
we focus on niche insurance markets where we offer insurance products designed to meet the unique needs of targeted insurance buyers that we believe are underserved by the insurance industry 
these niche markets typically possess what we view as barriers to entry  such as being too small  too remote or too difficult to attract or sustain most competitors 
examples of products that we write for these markets include property and casualty insurance for transportation companies of gross written premiums  captive programs for transportation companies that we refer to as our alternative risk transfer operations  specialty personal lines  primarily recreational vehicle coverage and transportation and general commercial insurance in hawaii and alaska 
we strive to become a market leader in the specialty markets that we choose and serve by offering what we believe are specialized products  excellent customer service and superior claims response 
the company and its subsidiaries write insurance for various sizes of transportation fleets 
we do not believe that smaller fleets that generate annual premiums of less than  are large enough to retain the risks associated with participation in one of the captive programs we currently offer 
because there are more smaller fleets  we have more opportunities to write smaller risks than larger ones 
as general economic conditions improve  entrepreneurs are encouraged to start new transportation companies  which typically commence operations as a smaller risk and a potential traditional insurance customer for the company 
during periods of economic downturn  such as immediately following september   the smaller risks are more prone to failure because leisure travel decreases and there is consolidation in the industry 
an increase in the number of larger risks results in more prospective captive insurance customers 
by offering insurance products to all sizes of risks  we believe we have hedged against the possibility that there will be a reduction in demand for the products we offer 
we believe that we will continue to have opportunities to grow and profit with both traditional and alternative risk transfer customers based on our assumptions regarding future economic and competitive conditions 
we generally incur low start up costs for new businesses  typically less than  incurred over several quarters 
we believe our flexible processes and scalable systems  along with controlled ramp up of businesses  allow us to manage costs and match them with the revenue flow 
the factors that impact our growth rate are consistent across all products 
however  the trends impacting each of these factors may vary from time to time for individual products 
those factors are as follows submissions the increase or decrease in the number of new applications we receive 
this is influenced by the effectiveness of our marketing activities compared to the marketing activities of our competitors in each market 
the change in the number of current policyholders that are available for a renewal quote 
the number of policyholders available for renewal changes based upon the economic conditions impacting our customer groups and the extent of consolidation that may be taking place within the industries we support 
quotes the change in the percentage of the new applications received that do not receive a company quote 
we do not quote risks that do not meet our risk selection criteria or for which we have not been provided complete application data 
we refer to this ratio as the declination ratio and an increasing declination ratio usually results in reduced opportunities to write new business 

table of contents sales the change in percentage of the quotes we issue that are actually sold 
we refer to this ratio as the hit ratio 
hit ratios are affected by the number of competitors  the prices quoted by these competitors and the degree of difference between the competitors pricing  terms and conditions and ours 
rates the change in our rate structure from period to period 
the rates we file and quote are impacted by several factors including the cost and extent of the reinsurance we purchase  our operating efficiencies  our average loss costs  which reflect the effectiveness of our underwriting routines  our underwriting profit expectations  and our claims adjusting processes 
the difference between our rates and the rates of our competitors is the primary factor impacting the revenue growth of our established product lines 
product offerings and distribution we operate in multiple markets with multiple distribution approaches to attempt to reduce the probability that an adverse competitive response in any single market will have a significant impact on our overall business 
we also attempt to maintain several new products  product line extensions or product distribution approaches in an active development status so we are able to take advantage of market opportunities 
we select from potential new product ideas based on our stated new business criteria and the anticipated competitive response 
industry and trends the property and casualty insurance industry is cyclical 
historically  the industry has been characterized by periods of price competition and excess capacity soft market followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market 
we believe that the commercial transportation market is currently in the part of the cycle that can best be described as softening as compared to the peak of the hard market in and in  we perceived the market starting to firm and we believe it remained hard in and through the first half of in the second half of  we perceived early indications of some softening 
the cyclical nature of the industry impacts our business operations 
for passenger transportation  distressed operators whether distressed due to being insured by other insurance companies that have raised rates or exited the market  or due to having less than desirable risk characteristics continue to be heavily marketed to us by brokers causing an increase in our new business declination rates 
in addition  renewal retention rates for all transportation continue at levels we view as favorable  however  our renewal rate increases were lower in than the increases attained from mid through increased rate levels beyond those necessary to keep up with inflation and achieve our planned financial targets have resulted in the company attaining combined ratios in recent periods that have enabled us to achieve our corporate objective of maintaining a combined ratio of or lower 
while our combined ratio may fluctuate from year to year  over the past five years we have exceeded our underwriting profit objective by achieving an average gaap combined ratio of 
our gaap combined ratio was in  in  in  in and in we believe the following factors have contributed to this performance our business model and bottom line orientation have resulted in what we believe is disciplined and consistent risk assessment and pricing adequacy 
our ability to attract and retain what we believe are some of the best transportation companies in the industries we serve into our captive programs 
operating expense reductions through system investments and a lower cost structure in our captive products 
additionally  our business may be affected by the risks impacting the property and casualty insurance industry related to severe weather conditions  explosions  terrorist attacks and riots 
for weather related events such as hurricanes  tornados and hailstorms  we conduct an analysis at least annually pursuant to which we input our in force exposures vehicle values in all states and property limits in 
table of contents hawaii into an independent catastrophe model that predicts our probable maximum loss at various statistical confidence levels 
our estimated probable maximum loss is impacted by changes in our in force exposures as well as changes to the assumptions inherent in the catastrophe model 
hurricane and other weather related events have not had a material negative impact on our past results 
severe hurricanes in the third and fourth quarter of and the same period in resulted in approximately million and million  respectively  in total incurred losses 
our transportation insurance business in particular also is affected by cost trends that negatively impact profitability such as inflation in vehicle repair costs  vehicle replacement parts costs  used vehicle prices  fuel costs and medical care costs 
we routinely obtain independent data for vehicle repair inflation  vehicle replacement parts costs  used vehicle prices  fuel costs and medical care costs and adjust our pricing routines to attempt to more accurately project the future costs associated with insurance claims 
historically  these increased costs have not had a material adverse impact on our results 
of course  we would expect a negative impact on our future results if we fail to properly account for and project for these inflationary trends 
increased litigation of claims may also negatively impact our profitability 
as described below  the average revenue dollar per personal lines policy is significantly lower than typical commercial policies 
profitability in the specialty personal lines component is dependent on proper pricing and the efficiency of underwriting and policy administration 
the company continuously strives to improve its underwriting and policy issuance functions to keep this cost element as low as possible by utilizing current technology advances 
to succeed as a transportation underwriter and personal lines underwriter  we must understand and be able to quantify the different risk characteristics of the operations we consider quoting 
certain coverages are more stable and predictable than others and we must recognize the various components of the risks we assume when we write any specific class of insurance business 
examples of trends that can change and  therefore  impact our profitability are loss frequency  loss severity  geographic loss cost differentials  societal and legal factors impacting loss costs such as tort reform  punitive damage inflation and increasing jury awards and changes in regulation impacting the insurance relationship 
any changes in these factors that are not recognized and priced for accordingly will affect the company s future profitability 
we believe our product management organization provides the focus on a specific risk class needed to stay current with the trends affecting each specific class of business we write 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from premiums from our insurance policies and income from our investment portfolio 
our underwriting approach is to price our products to achieve an underwriting profit even if it requires us to forego volume 
since  our insurance subsidiaries have been increasing their premium rates to offset rising losses and reinsurance costs 
rate increases continued during  but at a reduced pace and level as compared to and as with all property and casualty companies  the beneficial impact of these price increases is reflected in our financial results over time 
we implement price increases on our in force policies as they are renewed  which generally takes twelve months for our entire book of business and up to an additional twelve months to earn a full year of premium at the higher rate 
there are distinct differences in the timing of written premiums in traditional transportation insurance and our alternative risk transfer captive insurance components 
we write traditional transportation insurance policies throughout all months of the year and commence new annual policies at the expiration of the old policy 
under the captive programs  all members of the group share a common expiration date 
these common expiration dates are scheduled throughout the calendar year  with a majority renewing during the first half of the year 
any new captive program participant written during the last half of the calendar year will be written for less than a full annual term so its next renewal date coincides with the common expiration date of the captive program it has joined 
the alternative risk transfer component of our business grew to of total gross premium written during as compared to in this includes recognition of the company and its subsidiaries traditional transportation policyholders that elected to convert to a captive program in our traditional transportation insurance premiums are relatively unchanged as compared to  reflecting the conversion of traditional transportation policyholders to the captive program 

table of contents the projected profitability from the traditional transportation and transportation captive businesses are substantially comparable 
increased investment income opportunities generally are available with traditional insurance but the lower acquisition expenses and persistence of the captive programs generally provide for lower operating expenses from these programs 
the lower expenses associated with our captives generally offset the projected reductions in investment income potential 
from a projected profitability perspective  we are ambivalent as to whether a transportation operator elects to purchase traditional insurance or one of our captive program options 
all of our transportation products  traditional or alternative risk transfer  are priced to achieve targeted underwriting margins 
because traditional insurance tends to have a higher operating expense structure  the portion of the premiums available to pay losses tends to be lower for a traditional insurance quote versus an alternative risk transfer insurance quote 
we use a cost plus pricing approach that projects future losses based upon the insured s historic losses and other factors 
operating expenses  premium taxes  expenses and a profit margin are then added to the projected loss component to achieve the total premium to be quoted 
the lower the projected losses  expenses and taxes  the lower the total quoted premiums regardless of whether it is a traditional or alternate risk transfer program quotation 
quoted premiums are computed in accordance with our approved insurance department filings in each state 
our specialty personal lines products are also priced to achieve targeted underwriting margins 
the average premium per policy for this business component is significantly less than transportation lines 
we employ what we consider to be a conservative approach to investment and capital management with the intention of supporting insurance operations by providing a stable source of income to offset underwriting risk and growing income to offset inflation 
the primary goal of our investment policy is to preserve principal while optimizing income 
expenses our expenses consist primarily of losses and loss adjustment expenses  or lae  commissions and other underwriting expenses  and other operating and general expenses 
losses and lae are a function of the amount and type of insurance contracts we write and of the loss experience of the underlying risks 
we record losses and lae based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses we expect to be reported on contracts written 
we seek to establish case reserves at the maximum probable exposure based on our historical claims experience 
our ability to estimate losses and lae accurately at the time of pricing our contracts is a critical factor in determining our profitability 
the amount reported under losses and lae in any period includes payments in the period net of the change in the value of the reserves for unpaid losses and lae between the beginning and the end of the period 
commissions and other underwriting expenses consist principally of brokerage and agent commissions that represent a percentage of the premiums on insurance policies and reinsurance contracts written  and vary depending upon the amount and types of contracts written  and to a lesser extent ceding commissions paid to ceding insurers and excise taxes 
other operating and general expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses including salaries  benefits and certain costs associated with awards under our equity compensation plans and other general operating expenses 
other than expenses relating to stock options and other equity grants  our personnel expenses are primarily fixed in nature and do not vary with the amount of premiums written 
interest expenses are disclosed separately from operating and general expenses 
results of operations overview the company s net earnings for were million or per share diluted  compared to million or per share diluted recorded in the company s earnings increased compared to the same period in there are several factors that contributed to the increase in net earnings including continued growth in earned premium with loss and lae trends that as expected  have shown a slight deterioration in  but have been consistently favorable since the company s commissions and other underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums earned are lower in than  as a result of reductions in our estimated expenses related to insolvencies and other state fees and continued leverage of fixed expenses 
while expenses are 
table of contents higher in response to building our infrastructure and other related expenses of operating as a public entity  our overall increase in fixed expenses was lower than the revenue growth for our investment portfolio has grown during the year contributing to a increase in investment income 
underwriting underwriting profitability  as opposed to overall profitability or net earnings  is measured by the combined ratio 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and lae ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
a combined ratio under is indicative of an underwriting profit 
our underwriting approach is to price our products to achieve an underwriting profit even if it requires us to forego volume 
since  our insurance subsidiaries have been increasing their premium rates to offset rising losses and reinsurance costs

the ratio of the sum of commissions and other underwriting expenses  other operating expenses less other income to premiums earned 
there are distinct differences in the timing of written premiums in our traditional transportation component and our alternative risk transfer component composed primarily of captive programs compared to all of our other businesses 
the captive programs focus on specialty or niche insurance businesses that provide various services and coverages tailored to meet specific requirements of defined client groups and their members 
these services include risk management consulting  claims administration and handling  loss control and prevention  and reinsurance placement  along with various types of property and casualty insurance coverage 
insurance coverage is provided primarily to associations or similar groups of members and to specified classes of business of the company s agent partners 
except for our captive programs  we write most of our insurance policies throughout all months of the year and commence new annual policies at the expiration of the old policy 
under most of our captive programs  all members of a particular captive share a common expiration date 
any policy for a new captive program participant will be written between incept date and the next common renewal date of the captive program 
in the alternative risk transfer component  most captive members renew their contracts during the first six months of the year  resulting in a concentration of gross premiums during the first six months of a given fiscal year 
gross written premium includes both direct premium and assumed premium 
during  as a percent of total gross premiums written  the alternative risk transfer component of the business had the largest increase of points or million compared to the same period in the alternative risk transfer component added two new captive programs in  which accounted for of the increase in the alternative risk transfer component 
the 
table of contents remainder of the increase was primarily related to new participants in existing programs and to a lesser extent increased rates 
the company operates its business as one segment property and casualty insurance 
the company manages this segment through a product management structure 
the following table sets forth an analysis of gross premiums written by business component during the periods indicated year ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands transportation alternative risk transfer specialty personal lines hawaii and alaska other gross premiums written compared to the following table shows revenues for the years ended december  and summarized by the broader business component description  which were determined based primarily on similar economic characteristics  products and services year ended december  change revenue amount percent dollars in thousands premiums earned transportation alternative risk transfer specialty personal lines hawaii and alaska other total premiums earned net investment income realized gains on investments other total revenues our net premiums earned increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our alternative risk transfer component increased during compared to the same period in  primarily due to new captive programs and new participants in existing captive programs 
during this period and prior periods  our alternative risk transfer business was one of the fastest growing components of our business 
a portion of the new customers in the alternative risk transfer component were larger premium customers that were previously in our transportation component 
due to an increase in the number of policies in force primarily from expanded distribution  our specialty personal lines component increased in compared to the transportation component remained relatively constant in compared to the slight decrease in the transportation component is primarily due to i a decline in assumed premium from a reinsurance arrangement involving primarily physical damage coverage on trucks because the company with whom we had the agreement elected to exit the business and ii larger premium customers moving from the transportation component to our captive programs in the alternative risk transfer component 
our other component  which is comprised primarily of premium from assigned risk plans from the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries operate  increased or million to million in the increase in this component is primarily due to an increase in our assigned risk premiums 

table of contents the loss and lae ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the loss and lae ratio from to of points is primarily due to the fact that approximately of the increase in premiums earned in was produced by the alternative risk transfer and other component 
historically  these components have higher loss and lae ratios than the company s traditional components  and as a result had the effect of raising the loss ratio in this increase is mostly offset by a million favorable development of prior year loss reserves 
the company considers the variance in the loss and lae ratio of points for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  to be consistent with management s expectations that losses would deteriorate slightly based on historical loss patterns 
the underwriting expense ratio for the year ended december  decreased points to compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the underwriting expense ratio is primarily a result of four factors increased risk retention  continued leverage of our fixed expense  a reduction in our estimated expenses for insolvencies and other state fees and recording of assigned business 
in november  we increased our risk retention on public transportation products  which contributes to a decrease in our expense ratio as the additional retained written premium is earned 
while expenses are higher in response to building our infrastructure and other related expenses of operating as a public entity  our overall increase in fixed expenses was lower than the revenue growth for the year ended december  using data available from the national conference of insurance guarantee funds  we reduced our estimated expenses for insolvencies and other state fees during the third quarter of the reduction in estimated expenses reduced our underwriting expense ratio by points 
we record our assigned risk premium quarterly based on reports from various states and agencies that manage the plans 
the assignments are based on our written premium for specific coverages in certain states 
we have written workers compensation insurance in several states beginning in due to the lack of sufficient detail because the plans report to us on a lag  our estimated net share of the assigned risks were charged to commissions and other underwriting expenses  with a like amount recorded as assessments and fees payable in the correct periods 
during the third and fourth quarter of  sufficient information was obtained to enable us to classify the business on a gross basis  including premiums earned and losses and loss adjustment expenses 
while this had no impact on net income  it reduced our underwriting expense ratio by points

during this period and prior periods  our alternative risk transfer business was and continues to be one of the fastest growing 
table of contents components of our business 
a portion of the new customers in the alternative risk transfer component were larger premium customers that were previously in our transportation component 
the transportation component increased during due to increased rates on renewed policies and  because in the fourth quarter of  we expanded our community service and paratransit product 
offsetting the increase in the transportation component was a i a decline in assumed premium from a reinsurance arrangement involving primarily physical damage coverage on trucks because the company with whom we had the agreement elected to exit the business and ii larger premium customers moving from the transportation component to our captive programs in the alternative risk transfer component 
our hawaii and alaska component and other component  which is comprised primarily of premium from assigned risk plans from the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries operate  increased and  respectively 
the loss and lae ratio for increased points to compared to in the variance reflects less favorable development in compared to of losses that occurred in prior years  the adverse impact of four hurricanes that occurred in the third quarter of and unusually low frequency and severity of incurred losses experienced in favorable development of million in on net reserves of million compared to million for on net reserves of million resulted in a reduction of points of the variance 
the favorable development for both years was primarily the result of settlements below the established case reserves or revisions to our estimated settlements on an individual case by case basis  and primarily related to the preceding two years 
the revisions to our case reserves reflect new information gained by our claims adjusters in the normal course of adjusting claims and then reflected in the financial statements when the information becomes available 
it is typical for our larger commercial auto liability claims to take several years to settle and we continually revise our estimates as more information about the losses and related bodily injuries becomes known and the claims get closer to being settled 
we did not make any significant revisions to our reserving methodology or assumptions in or the results reflect million from hurricane losses that contributed points of the variance 
none of the hurricane losses were severe enough to trigger our property catastrophe insurance  which attaches at million per occurrence 
the unusually low frequency and severity of incurred losses in was the primary reason for the remaining point variance 
we believe that the low frequency and severity of losses in was more favorable than is typical  but not outside expected parameters 
other than the total absence of weather related catastrophes in  we are unaware of any specific events or trends that affected the timing and distribution of incurred losses 
in  incurred losses have been returning to ratios more consistent with historical results 
the underwriting expense ratio for improved point to compared to for the improvement resulted from our fixed expenses increasing at a slower rate than the net earned premium growth 
specifically  our employee related expenses grew at a slower rate than our revenue growth because the new positions created during this period were primarily entry level and we better leveraged existing management as our business grew 
investment income compared to net investment income increased million  or to million in compared to  due primarily to a growth in average cash and invested assets over the same period

table of contents other than temporary impairment adjustment of million recognized in the decrease in net realized gains in was due to fewer sales opportunities in the fixed income market in while designated as available for sale  we generally intend to hold our fixed maturities through maturity or recovery if in an unrealized loss position 
when evaluating sales opportunities  we do not have any specific thresholds that would cause us to sell these securities prior to maturity 
we consider multiple factors  such as reinvestment alternatives and specific circumstances of the investment currently held 
credit quality  portfolio allocation and other than temporary impairment are other factors that may encourage us to sell a security prior to maturity at a gain or loss 
historically and during the most recent extended low interest rate period  we have not had the need to sell our investment to generate liquidity 
compared to net realized gains of million for were comparable to million for other operating and general expenses compared to other operating and general expenses increased million  or to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in these increases reflect the continuing growth in our business and additional costs incurred related to being a publicly traded company 
compared to other operating and general expenses of million increased approximately  or million during the year ended december  compared to million during  reflecting the continuing growth in our business and the continued investment in the infrastructure  particularly information technology  required to support our growing business 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in  in and in differences in the effective tax rates are primarily due to the effect of tax exempt investment income 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements for further analysis of items affecting our effective tax rate 
financial condition investments at december  our investment portfolio contained million in fixed maturity securities and million in equity securities  all carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity on an after tax basis 
at december  we had pretax net unrealized losses of million on fixed maturities and a pretax unrealized gains of million on equity securities 
at december   of the fixed maturities in our portfolio were rated investment grade credit rating of aaa to bbb by standard poor s corporation

the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
factors considered and resources used by management include those discussed in management s discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other than temporary impairment

the national association of insurance commissioners model law for risk based capital rbc provides formulas to determine the amount of capital that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
at december  and  the capital ratios of all our insurance companies substantially exceeded the rbc requirements 
sources of funds 
the liquidity requirements of our insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and payments of dividends and taxes to us 
historically  cash flows from premiums and investment income have provided more than sufficient funds to meet these requirements without forcing the sale of investments 
if our cash flows change dramatically from historical patterns  for example as a result of a decrease in premiums or an increase in claims paid or operating expenses  we may be forced to sell securities before their maturity and possibly at a loss 
our insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid  short term investments to meet their liquidity needs 
funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities 
ordinarily  we collect premiums and earn investment income on the policies we issue in advance of the payment of losses 
our historic pattern of using premium receipts for the payment of liabilities has enabled us to extend slightly the maturities of our investment portfolio beyond the estimated settlement date of our loss reserves 
in an initial public offering completed in february  the company sold  shares of common stock generating approximately million of net proceeds 
we used the net proceeds for the repayment in full of a million loan plus the accrued interest from great american  our majority shareholder  and the remainder will continue to be used for other general purposes including surplus contributions to our insurance company subsidiaries 
we believe that our insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and operating expenses  as well as meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies  inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies 
we will have continuing cash needs for administrative expenses  the payment of principal and interest on borrowings  shareholder dividends and taxes 
funds to meet these obligations will come primarily from dividend and tax payments from our insurance company subsidiaries and from our line of credit 
under the state insurance laws  dividends and capital distributions from our insurance companies are subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus and earnings 
the maximum amount of dividends that our insurance companies could pay to us without seeking regulatory approval in is million 
our insurance subsidiaries paid no dividends in and paid million in dividends in without the need for regulatory approval 
under tax allocation and cost sharing agreements among nic and its subsidiaries  taxes and expenses are allocated among the entities 
the federal income tax provision of our individual subsidiaries is computed as if the subsidiary filed a separate tax return 
the resulting provision or credit is currently payable to or receivable from the company 
in may  we purchased the outstanding common equity of a business trust that issued mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities 
the trust used the proceeds from the issuance of its capital securities and common equity to buy million of debentures issued by us 
these debentures are the trust s only assets and mature in the interest rate is equal to the three month libor at december  and at 
table of contents december  plus basis points with interest payments due quarterly 
payments from the debentures finance the distributions paid on the capital securities 
we have the right to redeem the debentures  in whole or in part  on or after may  we used the net proceeds from the debentures to fund our obligations to our subsidiaries and to increase the capitalization of our insurance company subsidiaries 
we also have a million line of credit unused at december  that bears interest at the lending institution s prime rate at december  and at december  less basis points and requires an annual commitment fee of thousand 
in accordance with the terms of the line of credit agreement  interest payments are due monthly and the principal balance is due upon demand 
the line of credit is available currently  and has been used in the past  for general corporate purposes  including the capitalization of our insurance company subsidiaries in order to support the growth of their written premiums 
we may request an increase in this line of credit in the future based on liquidity and capital needs  although we have no current plans to do so 
we have a term loan that is governed by a four year  unsecured term loan agreement that was executed in august the note was originally issued for million and bears interest at the lender s prime rate at december  and at december  less basis points 
the outstanding principal amount at december  was million 
payments on the note are due in monthly principal installments of  plus interest 
the term loan agreement contains certain customary covenants for a term loan of this nature including covenants relating to delivery of financial statements  maintenance of insurance  payment of taxes  corporate existence  compliance with laws  maintenance of financial ratios  absence of liens and mergers and liquidations 
at december  we were in compliance with all of our loan covenants 
our insurance subsidiaries generate liquidity primarily by collecting and investing premiums in advance of paying claims 
for  and  we generated consolidated cash flow from operations of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that the remaining net proceeds from our initial public offering  funds generated from operations  including dividends  and funds available under our line of credit will provide sufficient resources to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
however  if these funds are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period  we would be required to generate cash through additional borrowings  sale of assets  sale of portfolio securities or similar transactions 
historically  and during the most recent extended low interest rate period  we have not had the need to sell our investments to generate liquidity 
if we were forced to sell portfolio securities early for liquidity purposes rather than holding them to maturity  we would recognize gains or losses on those securities earlier than anticipated 
if we were forced to borrow additional funds in order to meet liquidity needs  we would incur additional interest expense which would have a negative impact on our earnings 
since our ability to meet our obligations in the long term beyond a month period is dependent upon factors such as market changes  insurance regulatory changes and economic conditions  no assurance can be given that the available net cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating needs 
at december   the company had million held in an escrow account for the purchase of tcc from triumphe insurance holdings llc by niic 
the million that was held in an escrow account is shown on the december   consolidated balance sheet in other assets 
on january   the first business day after the january effective date of the purchase  the funds were released from the escrow account 
the company made a second payment of million for the remaining balance of the purchase price 
off balance sheet items

actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates  and the estimates provided do not reflect potential recoveries under reinsurance treaties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change and impact amounts reported in the future 
management believes that the establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and the determination of other than temporary impairment on investments are two areas where by the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
we discuss these two policies below 
our other significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
loss and loss adjustment expenses lae reserves significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of that loss to us and our final payment of that loss  and its related lae 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities 
at december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  of gross losses and lae reserves  representing management s best estimate of the ultimate loss 
management records on a monthly and quarterly basis its best estimate of loss reserves 
for purposes of computing the recorded reserves  management utilizes various data inputs  including analysis that is derived from a review of prior quarter results performed by actuaries employed by great american 
in addition  on an annual basis  actuaries from great american review the recorded reserves for niic and niic hi utilizing current period data and provide a statement of actuarial opinion  required annually in accordance with state insurance regulations  on the statutory reserves recorded by these us insurance subsidiaries 
since  our first full year of operations  the actuaries have opined each year that the reserves recorded at december are reasonable 
the actuarial analysis of niic s and niic hi s net reserves as of the end of fiscal years ending december  and reflected point estimates that were within of management s recorded net reserves as of such dates 
using this actuarial data along with its other data inputs  management concluded that the recorded reserves appropriately reflect management s best estimates of the liability as of each year end 
the quarterly reviews of unpaid loss and lae reserves by great american actuaries are prepared using standard actuarial techniques 
these may include but may not be limited to the case incurred development method  the paid development method  
table of contents the bornhuetter ferguson method  and the incremental paid lae to paid loss methods 
supplementary statistical information is reviewed to determine which methods are most appropriate and whether adjustments are needed to particular methods 
this information includes open and closed claim counts  average case reserves and average incurred on open claims  closure rates and statistics related to closed and open claim percentages  average closed claim severity  ultimate claim severity  reported loss ratios  projected ultimate loss ratios  and loss payment patterns 
an important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future 
the sensitivity of recorded reserves to an unexpected change in the trends  is estimated by adding to the trend that is embedded in the factors used to determine the reserves for ultimate liabilities 
this unexpected change could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation  inflation from social programs  new medical technologies  or other factors such as those listed below in connection with our largest lines of business 
the estimated cumulative unfavorable impact that this change would have on our net income is shown below in thousands cumulative line of business impact commercial auto liability workers compensation commercial auto liability 
in this line of business  we provide coverage protecting buses  limousines  other public transportation vehicles and trucking for accidents causing property damage or personal injury to others 
some of the important variables affecting our estimation of loss reserves for commercial auto liability include litigious climate  unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues  magnitude of jury awards  outside counsel costs  and frequency and timing of claims reporting 
workers compensation 
in this line of business  we provide coverage for employees who may be injured in the course of employment 
some of the important variables affecting our estimation of loss reserves for workers compensation include legislative actions and regulatory interpretations  future medical cost inflation  and timing of claims reporting 
within each line  great american actuaries review the results of individual tests  supplementary statistical information and input from management to select their point estimate of the ultimate liability 
this estimate may be one test  a weighted average of several tests  or a judgmental selection as the actuaries determine is appropriate 
the actuarial review is performed each quarter as a test of the reasonableness of management s point estimate and to 
table of contents provide management with a consulting opinion regarding the advisability of modifying its reserve setting assumptions for future periods 
the great american actuaries do not develop ranges of losses 
the level of detail at which data is analyzed varies among the different lines of business 
data is generally analyzed by major product or coverage  using countrywide data 
appropriate segmentation of the data is determined based on data volume  data credibility  mix of business and other actuarial considerations 
point estimates are selected based on test indications and judgment 
claims we view as potentially significant are subject to a rigorous review process involving the adjuster  claims management and executive management 
we seek to establish reserves at the maximum probable exposure based on our historic claims experience 
incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr  reserves are determined separate from the case reserving process and include estimates for potential adverse development of the recorded case reserves 
we monitor ibnr reserves monthly with financial management and quarterly with an actuary from great american 
ibnr reserves are adjusted monthly based on historic patterns and current trends and exposures 
when a claim is reported  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
the estimate reflects informed judgment of our claims personnel based on general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel 
during the loss adjustment period  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department based on developments and periodic reviews of the cases 
individual case reserves are reviewed for adequacy at least quarterly by senior claims management 
when establishing and reviewing reserves  we analyze historic data and estimate the impact of various loss development factors  such as our historic loss experience and that of the industry  trends in claims frequency and severity  our mix of business  our claims processing procedures  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in imposition of damages  and changes and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
a change in any of these factors from the assumptions implicit in our estimate can cause our actual loss experience to be better or worse than our reserves  and the difference can be material 
there is no precise method  however  for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves 
currently established reserves may not prove adequate in light of subsequent actual occurrences 
to the extent that reserves are inadequate and are increased or strengthened  the amount of such increase is treated as a charge to earnings in the period that the deficiency is recognized 
to the extent that reserves are redundant and are released  the amount of the release is a benefit to earnings in the period that redundancy is recognized 
the changes we have recorded in our reserves in the past three years illustrate the potential for revisions inherent in estimating reserves 
in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred prior to in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred prior to in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred in years prior to we did not significantly change our reserving methodology or our claims settlement process in any of these years 
the development reflected settlements that differed from the established case reserves  changes in the case reserves based on new information for that specific claim or the differences in the timing of actual settlements compared to the payout patterns assumed in our accident year ibnr reductions 
the types of coverages we offer and risk levels we retain have a direct influence on the development of claims 
specifically  short duration claims and lower risk retention levels generally are more predictable and normally have less development 
future favorable or unfavorable development of reserves from this past development experience should not be assumed or estimated 
the reserves reflected in the financial statements are our most accurate estimation 

table of contents the following table shows the breakdown of our reserves between case reserves estimated amounts required to settle claims that have already been reported  ibnr reserves estimated amounts that will be needed to settle claims that have already occurred but have not yet been reported to us  as well as reserves for possible development on known claims and lae reserves estimated amounts required to adjust  record and settle claims  other than the claim payments themselves gross loss reserves at december  statutory lines of business case ibnr lae total in thousands commercial auto liability workers compensation auto physical damage general liability private passenger inland marine commercial multiple peril other lines reinsurance recoverables 
we are also subject to credit risks with respect to our third party reinsurers 
although reinsurers are liable to us to the extent we cede risks to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all these risks 
as a result  reinsurance does not limit our ultimate obligation to pay claims to policyholders and we may not be able to recover claims made to our reinsurers 
we manage this credit risk by selecting what we believe to be quality reinsurers  closely monitoring their financial condition  timely billing and collecting amounts due and obtaining sufficient collateral when necessary 
other than temporary impairment our principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation risks 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
recognition of income ceases when a bond goes into default 
we evaluate whether impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause and amount of decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations we use in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  whether the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  economic stability of an entire industry sector or subsection  whether the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss  the extent to which the unrealized loss is credit driven or a result of changes in market interest rates  historical operating  balance sheet and cash flow data  internally generated financial models and forecasts  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  and other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 

table of contents when an investment is determined to have other than temporary impairment  in most cases we will evaluate the merits of disposing the investment  which will allow us to realize the loss for tax purposes and to reinvest the proceeds in what we view as more productive investments 
for those investments we choose to retain  we record an adjustment for impairment 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a non cash charge of million related to general motors acceptance corporation and ford motor credit corporation notes  with a combined par value of million 
in light of recent credit rating downgrades  and the difficulty in accurately projecting the future recovery period of the securities  the company concluded that this unrealized loss was an other than temporary impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
the charges established a new cost basis for these investment securities which are held as part of the available for sale portfolio 
we experienced no impairment adjustments in  thousand in adjustments in  respectively 
because total unrealized losses are a component of shareholders equity  any recognition of other than temporary impairment losses has no effect on our comprehensive income or book value 
see management s discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our exposures to market risk relate primarily to our investment portfolio  which is exposed to interest rate risk and  to a lesser extent  equity price risk 
we have not entered  and do not plan to enter  into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
fixed maturity portfolio 
the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio is directly impacted by changes in interest rates  in addition to credit risk 
our fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of substantially all fixed rate investments with primarily short term and intermediate term maturities 
we believe this practice allows us to be flexible in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
we manage the portfolios of our insurance companies to attempt to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
we invest in an evolving mix of traditional fixed income and variable rate notes  including step up rate and range notes  in our fixed maturity portfolio to capture what we believe are adequate risk adjusted returns in an evolving investment environment 
the following table provides information about our available for sale fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to interest rate risk 
the table shows expected principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for each of the five subsequent years and collectively for all years thereafter

we manage equity price risk primarily through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation techniques such as investing in exchange traded funds
