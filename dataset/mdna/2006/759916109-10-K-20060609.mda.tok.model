overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel therapeutics for diseases that affect the central nervous system 
a number of drug development programs are currently being conducted to evaluate our naturally occurring drug candidates in diseases such as schizophrenia  bipolar disorder and neurodegeneration 
in addition  we sell two commercial products  protein a for monoclonal antibody purification and secreflo for assessment of pancreatic disorders 
in fiscal  we experienced significant growth in sales and profits from our commercial products business 
our business strategy is to deploy the profits from our current commercial products and any revenue that we may receive from our patents to enable us to invest in the development of our product candidates in the treatment area of neuropsychiatric diseases while at the same time minimize our operating losses 
critical accounting policies and estimates while our significant accounting polices are more fully described in notes to our financial statements  we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition we apply staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 
to our revenue arrangements 
we generate product revenues from the sale of our protein a products to customers in the pharmaceutical and process chromatography industries and from the sale of secreflo to hospital based gastroenterologists 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize revenue related to product sales upon delivery of the product to the customer as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
during the fiscal year ended march   we received  of cash from a sponsored research and development project under an agreement with the stanley medical research institute 
research revenue is recognized for costs plus fixed fee contracts as costs are incurred 
during fiscal we generated non product revenues from sponsored research and development projects under a small business innovation research sbir 
table of contents phase i grant 
research expenses in the accompanying statements of operations include funded and unfunded expenses 
additionally  during fiscal year  the company earned and recognized approximately  in royalty revenue from chirhoclin  inc impairment analysis of long lived assets we review our long term assets for impairment at each reporting period in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
during fiscal  under the terms of our september licensing agreement with chirhoclin  inc we made a milestone payment to chirhoclin that consisted of  in cash and  shares of our common stock 
we recorded the fair value of the shares issued   and the cash paid of  as a long term intangible asset 
beginning in april  we began to amortize this intangible asset to cost of revenue over the remaining term of the license  approximately seven years 
we amortized  during the year ended march  at march   as a result of a dispute with chirhoclin  we recorded an impairment charge of  in our results of operations for the year ended march  during the year ended march   we amortized the remaining balance of this long term intangible asset of  to cost of goods sold 
this long term intangible asset was fully amortized at march  inventory we value inventory at cost or  if lower  fair market value 
we determine cost using the first in  first out method 
we regularly review our inventories and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on certain factors that may impact the realizable value of our inventory 
factors we consider include expected sales volume  production capacity and expiration dates 
we write down inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected requirements to cost of goods sold 
accrued liabilities we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require that we estimate accrued liabilities 
this process involves identifying services  which have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue expenses include fees paid to our contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials and service fees paid to organizations for their performance in conducting our clinical trials 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for that period may be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
repligen was not required to pay approximately  of accrued but unremitted royalties to chirhoclin related to sales of secreflo from february to march this amount was recorded as other income in the quarter ended june  
table of contents results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements and the related footnotes thereto 
revenues total revenue for fiscal  and were   and  revenues for the years ending march   and were primarily comprised of sales of our commercial products  protein a and secreflo 
during the fiscal year ended march   and sales of our commercial products were year ended march change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages protein a secreflo other product revenue product revenue substantially all of our products based on recombinant protein a are sold to customers who incorporate our manufactured products into their proprietary antibody purification systems to be sold directly to the pharmaceutical industry 
monoclonal antibodies are a well established class of drug with applications in rheumatoid arthritis  asthma  crohn s disease and a variety of cancers 
sales of protein a are therefore impacted by the timing of large scale production orders and on the regulatory approvals for such antibodies  which may result in significant quarterly fluctuations 
during fiscal  protein a sales increased by  as a result of a rise in the demand for our protein a products 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a supply agreement with gehc was amended to expand the scope of manufacturing and extend the term of the agreement through during fiscal  manufacturing problems experienced by one of our significant customers negatively impacted our sales of protein a 
we anticipate that sales of protein a will continue to grow during the next year  but at a reduced rate and will continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations due to timing of large scale production orders 
sales of secreflo decreased  in fiscal due to competition with our sole supplier of secreflo and as a result of a reduction in sales and marketing efforts 
sales increased  in fiscal from  in fiscal during which a delay in the delivery of a new lot of secreflo from the manufacturer negatively impacted sales 
the settlement in fiscal with our sole supplier of secreflo provides for continued supply during fiscal during the fiscal year  we received  of cash from a sponsored research and development project under an agreement with the stanley medical research institute 
research revenue is recognized for costs plus fixed fee contracts as costs are incurred 
additionally  during fiscal year  we earned and recognized approximately  in royalty revenue from chirhoclin  inc during fiscal  we generated  of non product revenues from sponsored research and development projects under a small business innovation research sbir phase i grant 

table of contents costs and operating expenses total costs and operating expenses for fiscal  and were approximately   and  respectively 
vs 
vs 
costs and operating expenses cost of product revenue research and development selling  general and administrative impairment of long lived asset total operating expenses the decrease in cost of product revenue of  in fiscal is attributable to a decrease in royalty and amortization fees of  associated with secreflo  partially offset by an increase of  in direct materials and increased personnel costs of  this reduction in secreflo related expenses is due to the settlement agreement in may of with chirhoclin while the increase in material costs and personnel is a result of higher sale levels 
during fiscal  the increase in costs of product revenue of  was directly attributable to higher product sales and a charge of approximately  for excess and expired inventory 
gross profit is positively impacted in periods when product sales are higher because there is more absorption of fixed costs 
we anticipate that higher product sales and the aforementioned settlement with chirhoclin will result in the similar margins for fiscal research and development expenses for fiscal  and were approximately   and  respectively 
research and development costs primarily include costs of internal personnel  external research collaborations  clinical trials and the costs associated with the manufacturing and testing of clinical materials 
we currently have ongoing research and development programs that support our product candidates of secretin and uridine 
in addition  we are involved with a number of early stage programs that may or may not be further developed 
due to the small size of the company and the fact that these various programs share personnel and fixed costs such as facility costs  depreciation  and supplies  we do not track our expenses by program 
each of our research and development programs is subject to risks and uncertainties  including the requirement to seek regulatory approvals that are outside of our control 
for example  our clinical trials may be subject to delays based on our inability to enroll patients at the rate that we expect to meet the schedule for our planned clinical trials 
moreover  the product candidates identified in these research programs  particularly in our early stage programs must overcome significant technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
for example  results from our preclinical animal models may not be replicated in our clinical trials with humans 
as a result of these risks and uncertainties  we are unable to predict with any certainty the period in which material net cash inflows from such projects could be expected to commence or the completion date of these programs 
these risks and uncertainties also prevent us from estimating with any certainty the specific timing and future costs of our research and development programs  although historical trends within the industry suggest that expenses tend to increase in later stages of development 
collaborations with commercial vendors and academic researchers accounted for  and of our research and development expenses in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the outsourcing of such services provides us flexibility to discontinue or increase spending depending on the success of our research and development programs 
during fiscal  research and development expenses increased by  this increase is largely attributable to higher clinical trial expenses of  increased personnel expenses of  and increased license expense of  offset by decreased expenses associated with our external research of  during fiscal  costs of clinical trials decreased by  clinical materials decreased by  external collaborations costs decreased by  and staffing costs decreased by 
table of contents future research and development expenses are dependent on a number of variables  including the cost and design of clinical trials and external costs such as manufacturing of clinical materials 
we expect our research and development expenses in fiscal to increase due to an increase in clinical trials and may further increase if we acquire an additional product candidate 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include the associated costs with selling our commercial products and costs required to support our research and development efforts including legal  accounting  patent  shareholder services and other administrative functions 
in addition  sg a expenses have historically included costs associated with various litigation matters 
during fiscal  sg a costs increased by approximately  this increase was a result of increased personnel expenses of  increased professional expenses of  increased legal expenses of  and increased marketing costs of  during fiscal  sg a costs decreased by approximately  a result of decreased costs in shareholder services of  and marketing expenses of  offset by increased legal costs of  and external costs relating to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of of  we expect sg a expenses to increase in fy due to litigation and personnel expenses 
impairment of long lived asset during fiscal  we recognized a non cash charge of  associated with the termination of the secreflo license agreement 
see legal proceedings and note of notes to financial statements 
investment income investment income includes income earned on invested cash balances 
investment income for fiscal  and was approximately   and  respectively 
the increase of  or in fiscal is attributable to a higher interest rates compared to fiscal the increase of  or in fiscal was attributable to higher interest rates earned as compared to fiscal we expect interest income to vary based on changes in the amount of funds invested and fluctuation of interest rates 
other income during the year ended march   repligen entered into a settlement agreement with chirhoclin  inc  in full settlement of their arbitration proceedings 
as a result of the settlement  we determined that we were not required to pay approximately  of previously accrued but unremitted royalties to chirhoclin related to secreflo sales from february to march this amount  which was accrued at march   was reversed at the time of settlement and is recorded as other income in the fiscal year ended march  other income for the year ended march  consists of  in proceeds from a legal settlement from pro neuron received in november liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and revenues derived from product sales and grants 
our revenue for the foreseeable future will be limited to our product revenue related to protein a and secreflo 
given the uncertainties related to pharmaceutical product development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our therapeutic product candidates or our patents will generate revenue and cash flows 
at march  we had cash and marketable securities of  compared to  at march  restricted cash of  is not included in cash and marketable securities for either or 
table of contents cash flows in thousands year ended march  cash provided by used in increase decrease increase decrease operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities in fiscal  our operating activities provided cash of  as a result of our net profit of  and non cash charges such as depreciation  amortization and stock compensation charges 
sources of cash included a decrease in accounts receivable of approximately  due to improved cash collections and a reduction in prepaid expenses of approximately  uses of cash included an increase in inventories of approximately  which was a result of purchases related to a manufacturing process conversion and an increase in accrued liabilities of approximately  in fiscal  our cash used in operations decreased from levels as a result of our reduced net loss before non cash charges such as depreciation  amortization and stock compensation charges 
this reduced loss benefited from the significant increase in our product sales  the receipt of  from a legal settlement and reduced research and development expenses 
increased product sales in fiscal also reduced our inventory levels 
accounts receivable decreased from levels due to improved cash collections 
in addition  as a result of a dispute with our supplier of secreflo we recorded a royalty obligation but did not pay  therefore  increasing accrued expenses 
investing activities in fiscal  our purchases of property  plant and equipment were  of which  was financed through capital leases 
we expect to incur greater than  of capital investment primarily to expand our protein a manufacturing facility in the next twelve months 
in fiscal  our purchases of property and equipment were  of which  was financed through capital leases 
purchases and redemptions of marketable securities account for the remainder of the fluctuation during fiscal and fiscal we generally place our marketable security investments in high quality credit instruments as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
financing activities in fiscal  exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of  in fiscal  exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of  a decrease from fiscal year s proceeds of  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet financing arrangements 

table of contents contractual obligations as of march   we had the following fixed obligations and commitments payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations contractual obligations total the above amounts represent principal payments only while principal and interest are payable through a fixed monthly payment of approximately  and a fixed annual payment of  this amount represents minimum commitments due under a third party manufacturing agreement 
these amounts include payments for license  supply and consulting agreements 
capital requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the success of our clinical studies  the scope of and progress made in our research and development activities  our ability to acquire additional product candidates  the success of any proposed financing efforts  and the ability to sustain sales and profits of our commercial products 
absent an acquisition of a product candidate  we believe our current cash balances are adequate to meet our cash needs for at least the next twenty four months 
we expect to incur an increased level of expense in fiscal compared to those incurred in fiscal this is due to anticipated increases in clinical study expenses and legal fees for litigation in process currently  as well as increased personnel expenses 
our future capital requirements include  but are not limited to  continued investment in our research and development programs  capital expenditures primarily associated with purchases of equipment and continued investment in our intellectual property portfolio 
we plan to continue to invest in key research and development activities 
after the discontinuation of our phase iii trial in autism  we began a review of technology and product candidates that would complement our existing portfolio of development programs 
we continue to seek to acquire such potential assets that may offer us the best opportunity to create value for our shareholders 
in order to acquire such assets  we may need to seek additional financing to fund these investments 
this may require the issuance or sale of additional equity or debt securities 
the sale of additional equity may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
should we need to secure additional financing to acquire a product  fund future investment in research and development  or meet our future liquidity requirements  we may not be able to secure such financing  or obtain such financing on favorable terms because of the volatile nature of the biotechnology marketplace 
net operating loss carryforwards at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately  to reduce future federal income taxes  if any 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards have expired and will continue to expire at various dates  
table of contents beginning in fiscal year  if not used 
net operating loss carryforwards and available tax credits are subject to review and possible adjustment by the internal revenue service and may be limited in the event of certain changes in the ownership interest of significant stockholders 
we did not record a tax provision in the fiscal year statement of operations as we did not generate taxable income 
effects of inflation our assets are primarily monetary  consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
since we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 
recent accounting pronouncements stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas no 
r  which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments  including employee stock options  at fair value  effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after november  generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
as of april  we plan on adopting sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  which is a method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
we apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a straight line basis 
we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r to have a material effect on our financial statements  in the form of additional compensation expense  on a quarterly and annual basis 
we expect to record total compensation expense of approximately  during fiscal as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
however  the actual expense recorded as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r may differ materially from the  as a result of changes in the number of options granted annually by repligen s board of directors  the price of our common stock  volatility of our stock price  the estimate of the expected life of options granted and risk free interest rates as measured at the grant date 
accounting changes and error corrections in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years after the date the statement was issued 
the company will apply the provisions of sfas no 
starting january  on a prospective basis 
the company does not believe that there will be a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations from the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have investments in commercial paper  us government and agency securities as well as corporate bonds and other debt securities 
as a result  we are exposed to potential loss from market risks that may occur as a result of changes in interest rates  changes in credit quality of the issuer or otherwise 
we generally place our marketable security investments in high quality credit instruments  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of march  however  the conservative nature of our investments mitigates our interest rate exposure  and our investment policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue  issuer  with the exception of us treasury obligations and type of instrument 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments due to interest rate fluctuations and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is limited 
we intend to hold these investments to maturity  in accordance with our business plans
