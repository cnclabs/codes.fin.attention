item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and our combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included as part of this annual report on form k 
operating results factors affecting operating results our results of operations are affected by the following key factors in each of our business divisions agribusiness in the agribusiness division  we purchase  store  process  transport and sell agricultural commodities and commodity products 
profitability in this division is principally affected by volatility in the prices of agricultural commodities and commodity products and the availability and cost of transportation and logistics services  including truck  barge  rail and ocean freight 
additionally  profitability in the division is also affected by the relative prices of processed oilseed products and the raw materials necessary to produce them  which are influenced by the global supply and demand for each 
our oilseed processing profitability is also impacted by industry capacity utilization and energy costs 
availability of agricultural commodities is affected by weather conditions  governmental policies and agricultural growing patterns 
demand is affected by growth in worldwide consumption of food products  population growth  changes in per capita incomes and the relative prices of substitute agricultural products 
we expect that population growth and rising standards of living will continue to have a positive impact on global demand for our agribusiness products 
from time to time  imbalances may exist between oilseed processing capacity and demand for oilseed products  which impacts our decisions regarding whether and when to purchase  store  process  transport or sell these commodities  including whether to reduce our own oilseed processing capacity 
fertilizer in the fertilizer division  demand for our products is affected by the profitability of the brazilian agricultural sector  agricultural commodity prices  international fertilizer prices  the types of crops planted  the number of acres planted  the quality of the land under cultivation and weather related issues affecting the success of the harvest 
in addition  our selling prices are influenced by international selling prices for imported fertilizers and raw materials  such as phosphate  ammonia and urea  as our products are priced to import parity 
profitability in our fertilizer division is also affected by the cost of imported raw materials since we do not produce locally all of our raw material requirements 
a significant portion of our raw material needs are met with imports 
the brazilian fertilizer business is also a seasonal business with fertilizer sales concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
as a result  we generally import and mine raw materials and produce finished goods during the first half of the year in preparation for the main brazilian cultivation season that occurs during the second half of the year 
food products in the food products division  which consists of our edible oil products and milling products segments  our operations are affected by changes in the prices of raw materials  such as crude vegetable oils and grains  the mix of products we sell  changes in eating habits  changes in per capita incomes  consumer purchasing power levels and changes in general economic conditions and the competitive environment in europe  north america and brazil  the principal markets of our food products division 
competition in this industry has intensified in the past several years due to consolidation in the supermarket industry and attempts by our competitors to increase market share 
in addition  our results of operations are affected by the following factors foreign currency exchange rates due to the global nature of our operations  our operating results can be materially impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
both translation of our foreign subsidiary financial statements and foreign currency transactions affect our results as described below 
translation of foreign currency financial statements 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
however  the functional currency of the majority of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency 
we translate the amounts included in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars on a monthly basis at weighted average exchange rates  which we believe approximates the actual exchange rates on the dates of the transactions 
translations of the local currency income statement and cash flow amounts to us dollars are affected by fluctuations of the local currency during a quarter versus the us dollar 
further  comparisons of results between quarters are affected by the differences in the average exchange rates during one quarter versus another quarter 
our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars from local currency at period end exchange rates and we record the resulting foreign exchange translation adjustments in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
included in other comprehensive income for the year ended december   and were foreign exchange net translation gains of million  million and million  respectively  representing the net gains from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities 
foreign currency transactions 
certain of our foreign subsidiaries  most significantly those in brazil  have monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in us dollars 
these us dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the applicable balance sheet date 
the resulting gain or loss is included in our consolidated statements of income as a foreign exchange gain or loss 
we also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as foreign currency forward contracts  swaps and options  to limit exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and our local currency operating expenses 
these derivative instruments are marked to market  with changes in their fair value recognized as a component of foreign exchange in our consolidated statements of income 
we may also hedge other foreign currency exposures as deemed appropriate 
brazil 
the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiaries is the brazilian real 
as such  exchange rate changes between the us dollar and the real affect our operating profitability 
the real appreciated against the us dollar at december  compared to the rate at december   and the real appreciated against the us dollar at december  when compared to the rate at december  in  the average real us dollar exchange rate was r  compared to r in  which represents a strengthening in the value of the real versus the us dollar in we use long term intercompany loans to reduce our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations in brazil  particularly their effects on our results of operations 
these loans do not require cash payment of principal and are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  the foreign exchange gains or losses on these intercompany loans are recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
this is in contrast to foreign exchange gains or losses on third party debt and short term intercompany debt  which are recorded in foreign exchange gains losses in our consolidated statements of income 
agribusiness segment brazil 
our agribusiness sales are u 
s dollar denominated or us dollar linked 
in addition  commodity inventories in our agribusiness segment are stated at market value  which is generally linked to us dollar based international prices 
as a result  these commodity inventories provide a natural hedge to our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates in our agribusiness segment 
devaluations of the real against the us dollar generally have a positive effect on our agribusiness segment results in brazil  as real denominated industrial and selling  general and administrative sg a costs are translated to us dollars at weaker real to us dollar exchange rates  which results in lower us dollar costs 
devaluations of the real generate gains based on the changes in the local currency value of these commodity inventories  which are reflected in cost of goods sold in our consolidated statements of income 
however  devaluations of the real will also generate offsetting net foreign exchange losses on the net us dollar monetary liability position of our brazilian agribusiness subsidiaries  which are reflected in foreign exchange losses in our consolidated statements of income 
as our brazilian subsidiaries are primarily funded with intercompany  us dollar denominated debt  the mark to market gains on the commodity inventories generally offset the foreign exchange losses on the intercompany us dollar denominated debt 
our effective tax rate is also favorably affected by the devaluation of the real  as we recognize tax benefits related to foreign exchange losses on certain intercompany loans 
the foreign exchange losses eliminate in our consolidated statements of income but the related tax effects remain 
appreciations generally have a corresponding negative effect on our results when local currency denominated costs are translated to us dollars at stronger real to us dollar exchange rates resulting in higher us dollar costs and losses based on changes in the local currency value of our agribusiness segment commodity inventories 
at the same time  appreciations of the real generate offsetting net foreign exchange gains on the net us dollar monetary position of our brazilian subsidiaries  which are reflected in foreign exchange gains in our consolidated statements of income 
our effective tax rate is unfavorably affected by the appreciation of the real  as we incur income taxes related to foreign exchange gains on certain intercompany loans 
however  we use derivative instruments to offset the foreign exchange gains on certain intercompany loans  which reduce the income tax expense resulting from the appreciation of the real 
fertilizer segment brazil 
our fertilizer segment sales prices are linked to us dollar priced imported and domestic raw materials 
mining  industrial and sg a expenses are real denominated costs 
inventories in our fertilizer segment are accounted for on the historical cost basis and are not marked to market 
these inventories are generally financed with us dollar denominated intercompany loans 
appreciations of the real against the us dollar result in higher mining  industrial and sg a expenses when translated into us dollars and net foreign exchange gains on the net us dollar monetary liability position of our fertilizer segment 
in addition  our gross profit margins are adversely affected by appreciations of the real as our local currency revenues are linked to us dollar priced imported and domestic raw materials  and we are selling higher cost inventories acquired and produced when the real was weaker 
inventories are typically acquired and produced in the first half of the year  while products are typically sold in the second half of the year 
thus  the recording of the exchange gains on the net us dollar monetary liability position and the effects of the appreciating real on our gross profit margins generally do not occur in the same quarterly reporting period 
as such  the foreign exchange impact on the intercompany debt is reflected monthly in our results while the impact on gross profit margins is reflected at the time products are sold 
the converse is true for devaluations of the real and their effects on our financial statements 
edible oil and milling products segment brazil 
our food products businesses are generally local currency businesses 
the costs of raw materials  principally wheat and soybean oil  are largely us dollar linked and changes in the costs of these raw materials have historically been passed through to the customer in the form of higher or lower selling prices 
however  delays or difficulties in passing through changes in raw materials costs into local currency selling prices can affect margins 
other operations 
we operate in countries that are members of the european union and several european countries that are not members of the european union 
our risk management policy is to fully hedge our monetary exposures in those countries to minimize the financial effects of fluctuations in the euro and other european currencies 
we also operate in argentina  where we are exposed to the peso 
our risk management policy is to fully hedge our monetary exposure to the financial effects of fluctuations in the value of the peso relative to the us dollar 
income taxes as a bermuda exempted company  we are not subject to income taxes in our jurisdiction of incorporation 
however  our subsidiaries  which operate in multiple tax jurisdictions  are subject to income taxes at various statutory rates 
in  we received a favorable us tax ruling with respect to the tax status of certain entities acquired in the acquisition of cereol sa cereol 
we had recorded a million deferred tax liability in the opening balance sheet of cereol in  related to unremitted earnings of a subsidiary that were not considered to be permanently reinvested 
based upon the final ruling received in  we determined that the subsidiary could be liquidated without generating tax on the unremitted earnings 
as a result of receipt of the favorable us tax ruling  and in accordance with eitf issue no 
 uncertainties related to income taxes in a purchase business combination  we reduced certain indefinite lived intangible assets acquired in the cereol acquisition by million  net of deferred tax liabilities  to zero and then recognized a million non cash tax benefit in our consolidated statements of income 
in conjunction with this transaction  we incurred million of tax expense in  related to the repatriation of the post acquisition unremitted earnings of a foreign subsidiary under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
we have in the past obtained tax benefits under us tax laws providing incentives under the provisions of the extraterritorial income act eti legislation 
however  the jobs act ultimately repeals the eti benefit 
under the jobs act  the eti will be phased out with of the otherwise available eti benefit retained for  of the otherwise available eti benefit retained for  of the otherwise available eti benefit retained for and the eti benefit phased out completely in the eti benefit has been replaced with an income tax deduction intended to allocate benefits previously provided to us exporters across all manufacturers when fully phased in 
although most of our us operations qualify as manufacturing  we do not expect to receive significant benefits from this new tax legislation as we have from the prior one primarily due to our us tax position 
inflation inflation did not have a material impact on our business in  or results of operations overview our agribusiness results for were lower than despite higher volumes 
overall  agribusiness volumes for increased over as customers continued to respond to lower agricultural commodity prices and lower ocean freight prices as compared to s higher prices 
soybean prices declined significantly in the second half of  in response to a record us soybean crop and for most of remained lower than spot market prices for ocean freight have declined primarily due to an increase in vessel availability resulting from new capacity and a reduction in chinese demand for ocean freight 
as a result  our agribusiness margins have suffered  as it is more difficult to fully recover our freight costs for shipments to customers 
our agribusiness results will continue to be pressured by freight costs 
in brazil  farm economics in deteriorated due to a drought  lower soybean prices and a steadily appreciating real 
brazilian farmers reacted to these conditions by withholding crop sales which negatively affected our results in this region 
our agribusiness results also suffered from the effects of a stronger real on local currency costs when these costs were translated into us dollars 
our european agribusiness margins improved as a result of our european biodiesel operations  which were contributed to a joint venture in the fourth quarter of see liquidity and capital resources formation of european biodiesel joint venture below 
softseed operations benefited from ample commodity supplies and strong demand for vegetable oil from the biodiesel sector 
our fertilizer results for were lower than due to higher costs and lower margins 
margins suffered primarily due to a stronger real which contributed to higher inventory carrying costs and operating expenses  which are real based 
in anticipation of stronger demand later in  we purchased and manufactured excess fertilizer inventories early in the year which resulted in increased inventory carrying costs as these inventories were purchased when the real was weaker but sold later at a stronger real us dollar exchange rate  which pressured our margins when translated into us dollars 
additionally  as a result of lower retail fertilizer sales in the soybean sector  our fertilizer inventory levels were higher than necessary going into by the end of  we sold a significant portion of these higher priced excess fertilizer inventories at lower prices  reducing our inventories to more appropriate levels 
margins were further pressured by the inability of farmers to absorb higher selling prices  which was in contrast to  when farmers purchased fertilizer earlier in the year to take advantage of lower prices 
fertilizer results were also negatively impacted by increases in bad debt expenses 
as a result of these industry conditions in brazil  and our efforts to reduce costs and improve capacity utilization  we have reduced our workforce in brazil by approximately  permanently closed two oilseed processing plants and idled seven fertilizer facilities and initiated other cost savings measures in we have also expanded our risk management program to lower our exposure to the real by hedging both balance sheet and income statement exposures 
our agribusiness and fertilizer results included impairment and restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  reflecting the costs of the plant closures and workforce reductions in brazil 
we estimate that these steps will save million to million in in addition  we are expanding our phosphate mining capacity in brazil by over allowing us to substitute more expensive imported fertilizer raw materials with domestic supply at lower costs 
we expect the recovery in the brazilian farm sector to be slow in largely due to the continued strengthening of the real 
as a result  we expect that retail fertilizer volumes in the brazilian market will be flat in we also expect a more competitive oilseed processing environment in argentina  as the industry expands capacity in that country 
in addition  we expect to close three additional oilseed processing plants in brazil in the first quarter of  which will result in asset impairment and restructuring charges related to those closures  the amount of which has not yet been determined 
we will continue to monitor market conditions in south america  and additional future restructuring and asset impairment charges may result if conditions improve slower than expected or not to the extent expected 
although edible oil results improved in north america and brazil in  these increases were more than offset by declines in profitability in eastern europe 
brazil and the united states benefited from higher margins primarily due to lower raw material costs 
in addition  the increased demand for low and reduced trans fat products boosted our canola oil margins 
results in eastern europe were negatively affected by lower average selling prices and the high cost of raw materials we had purchased in in romania and the ukraine  higher selling and marketing expenses for repositioned and new margarine brands in poland and higher selling expenses in russia due to the establishment of a new sales group 
until the completion of a new sunseed crushing plant in voronezh  russia  which is expected by the end of  we will continue to supply our russian bottled oil business with imports at higher costs compared to domestic supply 
in  we also incurred million of restructuring charges relating to workforce reductions in brazil and europe 
our milling product segment results for were higher than wheat milling products benefited from improved product mix resulting in higher volumes and selling prices in brazil 
corn milling results declined primarily due to lower margins 
segment results in  we reclassified certain agribusiness product lines from the edible oil products segment to the agribusiness segment 
as a result  amounts for the years ended december  and have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
in the second quarter of  we sold our brazilian soy ingredients business to the solae company  our joint venture with dupont 
as a result  our other soy ingredients segment now reflects only the historical results of this soy ingredients business 
a summary of certain items in our consolidated statements of income and volumes by reportable segment for the periods indicated is set forth below 
year ended december  percent change percent change us in millions  except percentages volumes in thousands of metric tons agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total year ended december  percent change percent change us in millions  except percentages net sales agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total costs of goods sold agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total gross profit agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total selling  general and administrative expenses agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total foreign exchange gain loss agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total interest income agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total year ended december  percent change percent change us in millions  except percentages interest expense agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total segment operating profit agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total depreciation  depletion and amortization agribusiness fertilizer edible oil products milling products other soy ingredients total net income total segment operating profit is our consolidated income from operations before income tax and minority interest that includes an allocated portion of the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to debt financing operating working capital  including readily marketable inventories 
also included in total segment operating profit is an allocation of interest income and interest expense attributable to the financing of operating working capital 
total segment operating profit is a non gaap measure and is not intended to replace income from operations before income tax and minority interest  the most directly comparable gaap measure 
total segment operating profit is a key performance measurement used by our management to evaluate whether our operating activities cover the financing costs of our business 
we believe total segment operating profit is a more complete measure of our operating profitability  since it allocates foreign exchange gains and losses and the cost of debt financing working capital to the appropriate operating segments 
additionally  we believe total segment operating profit assists investors by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of our portfolio of businesses before non operating factors that affect net income 
total segment operating profit is not a measure of consolidated operating results under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to income from operations before income tax and minority interest or any other measure of consolidated operating results under gaap 
below is a reconciliation of income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest to total segment operating profit year ended december  us in millions income from continuing operations before income tax and minority interest unallocated income expense net gain on sale of soy ingredients business total segment operating profit unallocated income expense net includes interest income  interest expense  foreign exchange gains and losses and other income and expense not directly attributable to our operating segments 
compared to agribusiness segment 
agribusiness segment net sales decreased due to lower average selling prices for agricultural commodity products  partially offset by an increase in volumes 
the decrease in average selling prices was primarily due to increased global supply of grains and oilseeds 
agribusiness volumes increased as customers responded to lower prices in for agricultural commodities compared to s higher prices 
cost of goods sold decreased primarily due to lower raw material costs  partially offset by an increase in volumes 
included in cost of goods sold in was million of impairment and restructuring charges relating to two oilseed processing plants in brazil  which were closed in  and the impairment of one plant in india  a million decrease in the remaining balance of our allowance for recoverable taxes in argentina  primarily as a result of payments being received without delays and the significant improvement in the argentine government s financial condition  and a reversal of a million provision for a transactional tax resulting from a favorable us tax ruling 
included in cost of goods sold in were million of non cash impairment charges on long lived assets and million of restructuring charges relating to our western european oilseed processing operations 
gross profit decreased primarily due to lower results in our brazilian agribusiness operations caused by the slower pace of farmer selling  which reduced margins and capacity utilization in brazil  freight costs and higher operational expenses due to the impact of the stronger real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
sg a decreased primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expense as a result of recoveries on advances to farmers and lower variable compensation expense  offset in part by the impact of the stronger brazilian real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars 
sg a included million of restructuring charges relating to a workforce reduction in our brazilian and european operations 
segment operating profit decreased primarily due to the decrease in gross profit 
fertilizer segment 
fertilizer segment net sales increased primarily due to an increase in average selling prices offset in part by a decrease in volumes 
retail volumes declined as farmers reduced their fertilizer purchases due to reduced plantings of soybeans and a reduction in the use of fertilizers 
partially offsetting the volume decline was an increase in nitrogen based fertilizer sales volumes in compared to as brazilian farmers responded to attractive sugar cane prices by increasing their sugar cane plantings 
selling prices benefited from higher international prices primarily for nitrogen based fertilizer raw materials 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to increases in imported raw material costs  higher operational and depreciation expenses attributable to new blending  granulation and acidulation plants that commenced production during the second quarter of and higher costs due to the impact of the stronger real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars in compared to legislation passed in brazil in may enabled us to recover million in value added tax credits  which are included as a reduction to cost of goods sold 
gross profit decreased by primarily due to lower volumes  increases in raw material costs  operational and depreciation expenses 
we purchased and manufactured fertilizer inventories in anticipation of stronger demand later in the year  which resulted in increased inventory carrying costs as these fertilizer inventories were purchased when the real was weaker but sold later at a stronger real us dollar exchange rate 
this negatively pressured margins as fertilizer prices in us dollar terms remained relatively stable 
margins were further negatively affected by the inability of the farmers to absorb higher selling prices 
sg a increased primarily due to higher bad debt expense of million  higher employee expenses  a million restructuring charge relating to a workforce reduction in brazil and the effect of the stronger real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars compared to last year 
bad debt expense increased primarily due to increases in delinquent accounts as a result of weakened farm economics in brazil 
in certain regions in brazil  the crop was poor in quality and yield  primarily due to a drought 
in  sg a included a reversal of a provision of million due to favorable settlement relating to an audit of value added taxes in brazil 
segment operating profit decreased primarily due to the decrease in gross profit and increases in sg a 
edible oil products segment 
edible oil products segment net sales decreased primarily due to lower average selling prices caused by a decrease in raw material costs that resulted from increased global supply of oilseeds 
the decrease in average selling prices was partially offset by a increase in volumes 
our volumes increased in most regions as a result of the lower selling prices  which helped stimulate customer demand 
cost of goods sold decreased primarily due to lower raw material costs offset partially by increases in energy costs 
included in cost of goods sold in were million of impairment charges related to write downs of certain refining and packaging facilities in our north and south american edible oil operations 
gross profit increased primarily due to the increase in sales volumes  lower raw material costs and a more profitable product mix in most locations 
sg a increased increased primarily due to the effects of a stronger real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars  higher employee costs related to building our sales force in russia and higher advertising expenses in brazil and poland related to the launch and repositioning of our margarine brands 
in  sg a included million of restructuring charges relating to a work force reductions in brazil and europe 
segment operating profit decreased primarily due to the increase in sg a 
milling products segment 
milling products segment net sales increased primarily due to higher average selling prices for wheat milling products as a result of improved product mix and higher volumes in brazil benefited by increases in international wheat prices 
average selling prices for corn milling products were slightly lower 
cost of goods sold increased primarily due to higher energy costs and operational expenses resulting from the impact of the stronger real on local currency costs when translated into us dollars offset by lower volumes 
in addition  cost of goods sold for benefited from raw material purchases we made earlier in the year prior to an increase in international wheat prices and lower expenses due to synergies created from the exchange of our brazilian retail flour assets for the industrial flour assets of j 
mac do sa in gross profit increased primarily due to higher average selling prices for wheat milling products  lower raw material costs and a more profitable mix of products sold 
sg a increased primarily due to the impact of the stronger real 
segment operating profit increased as a result of the improvement in gross profit 
consolidated financial costs 
the following is a summary of consolidated financial costs for the periods indicated year ended december  change us in millions  except percentages interest income interest expense foreign exchange losses interest income increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest bearing accounts receivable 
interest expense increased due to higher average interest rates on short term debt 
foreign exchange losses of million in included hedging costs related to our exposure in brazil partially offset by exchange gains on our brazilian us dollar net monetary liability position primarily due to the appreciation of the real in in addition  the devaluation of the argentine peso in resulted in exchange losses on our argentine us dollar net monetary liability position 
foreign exchange losses of million in included hedging costs related to our exposure in brazil and exchange losses on our brazilian us dollar net monetary liability position primarily due to the devaluation of the real in the first six months of during the third quarter of  the real appreciated resulting in foreign exchange gains on the us dollar net monetary liability position in brazil in that quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  the real and the euro appreciated against the us dollar which resulted in foreign exchange gains on the us dollar net monetary liability positions of bunge s brazilian and european subsidiaries 
the foreign exchange gains recorded in the third quarter of did not offset the foreign exchange losses recorded in the first six months of primarily because the aggregate net us dollar monetary liability position in the third quarter of was less than it was in the first half of other income expense net 
other income expense net increased million to million in from million in primarily due to higher earnings from bunge s french vegetable oil processing and european biodiesel joint ventures and gains on the sales of long lived assets 
included a pretax gain of million from the formation of our biodiesel joint venture with diester industrie in december included a pretax gain of million from our asset exchange transaction with j 
mac do 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit for of million included a non cash million reversal of a deferred tax liability as a result of a favorable us tax ruling with respect to unremitted earnings of a foreign subsidiary acquired see income taxes above and a million reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances as a result of the projected utilization of net operating loss carry forwards 
we were able to recognize these operating loss carry forwards because of the legal restructuring of the bunge s brazilian subsidiaries  increased statutory taxable income of these subsidiaries caused by the effects of the real appreciation and actions undertaken to recover the net operating loss carry forwards 
the remaining decrease in our income taxes was primarily attributable to a reduction in earnings in higher tax jurisdictions 
minority interest 
minority interest expense decreased million to million in from million in  primarily due to lower earnings from our non wholly owned subsidiaries and the acquisition of the remaining minority interest of bunge brasil sa in the third and fourth quarters of bunge now owns of bunge brasil 
net income 
net income increased million to million in from million in net income for includes the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances of million and a reduction of deferred tax liabilities of million due to a favorable tax ruling  impairment and restructuring charges of million  net of tax  the reversal of valuation allowances on recoverable taxes of million  net of tax  the value added tax credits of million  net of tax  related to a change in tax laws  gains on sales of long lived assets of million  net of tax and a reversal of a transactional tax provision for million  net of tax  due to a favorable tax ruling 
net income for included million of after tax impairment and restructuring charges on long lived assets in europe and a million after tax gain on the asset exchange transaction with j 
mac do 
compared to agribusiness segment 
agribusiness segment net sales increased due to higher average selling prices for soy commodity products and a increase in volumes 
selling prices for soy commodity products increased compared to last year primarily due to the shortage associated with the reduced us soybean crop 
prices of our softseed products also increased following the trend of soybean product prices 
volume increases were driven mainly by higher origination volumes in north america and south america 
cost of goods sold increased due to higher raw material costs  increased volumes and provisions related to the values of certain forward sales contracts for agricultural commodity products due to nonperformance by counterparties 
included in cost of goods sold in were million of non cash impairment charges on long lived assets and million of restructuring charges relating to our western european oilseed processing operations 
included in cost of goods sold in were million of non cash impairment charges on long lived assets in our european oilseed processing operations  a million decline in our allowance for recoverable taxes as a result of either cash received by us or compensation against taxes owed by us to the argentine government and a curtailment gain of million relating to the reduction of pension and postretirement healthcare benefits of certain us employees 
gross profit increased due to improvements in margins which resulted from effective freight and risk management  strong softseed profitability  efficiency improvements in logistics and higher volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased primarily due to increases in bad debt expense associated with higher commodity prices  increased variable employee compensation expense relating to the improved financial results  increased legal and tax provisions and an increase in the work force in our international marketing business 
sg a in benefited from a million curtailment gain relating to certain postretirement healthcare benefit plans 
foreign exchange losses for were million compared to foreign exchange gains of million in through the first six months of  the real devalued against the us dollar  resulting in exchange losses on our us dollar net monetary liability position in brazil 
our us dollar monetary exposure in brazil is typically at its highest level during the first half of the year 
during the second half of  the real appreciated  resulting in exchange gains on our us dollar net monetary liability position in brazil 
however  the exposure to the us dollar was lower and thus the related exchange gains recorded in the second half of were not enough to offset the exchange losses recorded through the first six months of the exchange gains in resulted from the appreciation of the real 
foreign exchange gains and losses are substantially offset by inventory mark to market adjustments  which are included in cost of goods sold 
interest expense increased primarily due to higher average levels of operating working capital  as a result of the higher commodity prices experienced during most of the year 
segment operating profit increased primarily due to the improvements in margins and volume growth 
fertilizer segment 
fertilizer segment net sales increased due to higher average selling prices 
selling prices benefited from higher international selling prices for imported fertilizers and raw materials  which helped increase local sales prices as local fertilizer products are priced to import parity 
although volumes in were flat versus  retail fertilizer sales volumes increased as a result of a slight increase in market share 
however  the retail fertilizer volume growth in was offset by a decrease in sales volumes of lower margin fertilizer byproducts  such as gypsum 
cost of goods sold increased due to higher imported raw material costs mitigated in part by lower local production costs as we are able to source much of our raw materials from our own mines 
gross profit increased as a result of higher fertilizer selling prices  partially offset by increases in imported raw material costs 
sg a increased primarily due to bad debt provisions associated with the higher selling prices  increases in employee compensation expense because of higher salaries and certain other labor and legal provisions 
in addition  benefited from non recurring credits relating to social health and welfare taxes in brazil and lower bad debt expense 
segment operating profit increased primarily due to the increase in gross profit  partially offset by the increase in sg a  higher foreign exchange losses as a result of costs associated with managing foreign exchange exposure and higher interest expense associated with increases in working capital levels 
edible oil products segment 
the table below outlines our edible oil products segment results for and the results for include the results of lesieur  a french bottled oil producer  which we sold to our saipol joint venture in july in addition  for comparative purposes  the results of our edible oil products segment excluding lesieur and the results of lesieur alone are also presented 
year ended december  year ended december  actual actual excluding lesieur lesieur us in millions  except volumes volumes in thousands of metric tons net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses foreign exchange gain interest income interest expense segment operating profit edible oil products segment net sales  excluding lesieur  increased primarily due to a increase in sales volumes and higher average selling prices 
increases in selling prices were primarily due to higher raw material costs  principally crude soybean oil 
the increase in soybean oil prices also resulted in higher selling prices for other softseed products as they follow the trend of soybean oil prices primarily in north america and eastern europe 
volumes increased primarily in north america as a result of stronger demand 
cost of goods sold  excluding lesieur  increased primarily due to increases in sales volumes and higher raw material costs 
included in cost of goods sold in were million of impairment charges relating to write downs of certain refining and packaging facilities in our north and south american edible oil operations and in  a million curtailment gain relating to certain postretirement healthcare benefit plans 
gross profit  excluding lesieur  decreased primarily due the impairment charges incurred in and higher raw material costs partially offset by increases in sales volumes and margin expansion in eastern europe and canada as a result of the higher average selling prices 
sg a  excluding lesieur  decreased primarily due to lower marketing expenses 
sg a in benefited from a million curtailment gain relating to certain postretirement healthcare benefit plans 
segment operating profit  excluding lesieur  decreased primarily due to lower gross profit and higher interest expenses attributable to higher levels of working capital partially offset by increases in sales volumes 
milling products segment 
milling products segment net sales increased primarily due to a increase in sales volumes 
corn milling volumes increased primarily due to higher sales to us commercial customers  higher sales under the us government food aid program and the addition of a corn milling facility acquired in the latter half of the increase in wheat milling volumes was primarily due to the addition of our industrial flour business which resulted from the asset exchange of bunge s brazilian retail flour assets for j 
mac do sa s industrial flour assets and million in cash in march cost of goods sold increased due to the increase in sales volumes and higher raw material costs 
gross profit increased primarily due to the increase in sales volumes 
segment operating profit increased by as a result of the improvement in gross profit 
consolidated financial costs 
the following is a summary of consolidated financial costs for the periods indicated year ended december  percent change us in millions  except percentages interest income interest expense foreign exchange losses gains included in interest income for was million of interest income earned on the cash invested in brazil from the net proceeds of the june public equity offering  which was used in the third and fourth quarters of to acquire the remaining equity interest in bunge brasil that we did not already own 
excluding this million  interest income decreased due to lower interest rates earned on invested cash in brazil  partially offset by an increase in the average balance of invested cash 
interest expense decreased million primarily due to lower interest rates on our debt portfolio and million of benefits from interest rate hedges  partially offset by higher average borrowings 
foreign exchange losses of million included costs associated with managing foreign exchange exposure related to our monetary exposure in brazil and exchange losses on our brazilian us dollar net monetary liability position primarily due to the devaluation of the real in the first six months of the first half of the year is usually when our us dollar net monetary liability exposure in brazil is at its highest level because of our acquisition of crops harvested in april  may and june 
during the six months ended december   the real appreciated resulting in exchange gains on the us dollar net monetary liability position in brazil in that period 
however  the exposure to the us dollar was lower and thus the related exchange gains recorded in the six months ended december  were not enough to offset the exchange losses recorded in the first six months of the appreciation in the value of the euro during also resulted in exchange gains on our european us dollar monetary liability position 
the exchange gains in resulted from the appreciation in the value of the brazilian real versus the us dollar and a gain on a net us dollar denominated monetary asset in argentina 
foreign exchange gains and losses are substantially offset by inventory marked to market adjustments  which are included in cost of goods sold 
other income expense net 
other income expense net increased million to million in from million of income in primarily due to million of gains on interest rate derivatives and the pretax gain of million on the asset exchange transaction with j 
mac do  offset by a decrease in our earnings from solae 
solae s results declined primarily due to lower margins on product sales caused by the high commodity costs that existed during most of income tax expense 
income tax expense increased million to million in from million in primarily due to an increase in pretax income 
our annual effective tax rate for was  compared to an annual effective tax rate of in excluding the tax free gain on the sale of our brazilian soy ingredients business to solae  the annual effective tax rate was 
the primary cause of the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to increased earnings in in lower tax jurisdictions 
minority interest 
minority interest expense increased million to million in from million in primarily due to increased earnings at our less than wholly owned subsidiaries 
net income 
net income increased million to million in from million in net income for included million of after tax impairment and restructuring charges on long lived assets in europe and a million after tax gain on the asset exchange transaction with j 
mac do 
net income for included the million gain on the asset sale of our brazilian soy ingredients business to solae  an after tax gain of million relating to the curtailment of certain pension and postretirement healthcare benefit plans  million of after tax impairment charges on long lived assets in europe and a loss on discontinued operations of million related to operations we sold in liquidity and capital resources our primary financial objective is to maintain sufficient liquidity through a conservative balance sheet that provides flexibility to pursue our growth objectives 
our current ratio  defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  was and at december  and  respectively 
cash and readily marketable inventories 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  and million at december  included in our inventories were readily marketable inventories of  million at december  and  million at december  readily marketable inventories are agricultural commodity inventories  financed primarily with debt  which are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics  widely available markets and international pricing mechanisms 
the increase in inventories was primarily attributable to our north american operations where inventories returned to more normal levels at the end of relative to unusually low inventory levels at the end of which were caused by reluctant farmer selling due to perceived low commodity prices 
fertilizer segment accounts receivable 
in our fertilizer segment  customer accounts receivable typically have repayment terms of up to days 
the actual due dates are individually determined based upon when a farmer purchases our fertilizers and the anticipated harvest and sale of the farmer s crop  as the farmer s cash flow is cyclical and is typically generated after the crop is harvested 
the payment terms for these accounts receivable are typically renegotiated if there is a crop failure or the cash flows generated from the harvest are not adequate for the farmer to repay balances due to us 
in certain regions in brazil  the crop was poor in quantity and yield  primarily due to a drought 
as a result of the extension of credit terms and concerns about the collectibility of some of the accounts receivable  we have increased our reserve for doubtful accounts in the fertilizer segment to million at december  from million at december  at december   our total fertilizer segment accounts receivable was million compared to million at december  we closely monitor the recoverability of these accounts receivable 
secured advances to suppliers and prepaid commodity contracts 
we purchase soybeans through prepaid commodity purchase contracts and advances to farmers in brazil 
these arrangements are typically secured by the farmer s future crop and mortgages on the farmer s land and other assets and are generally settled after the farmer s crop is harvested and sold 
at december   we had million in prepaid commodity purchase contracts and advances to farmers compared to million at december  against these outstanding balances  we also had accounts payables reflecting soybeans which had been delivered by these farmers to our facilities with a value of million as of december  and million as of december  the allowance for uncollectible advances totaled million at december  and million at december  we closely monitor the collectibility of these advances 
accounts receivable securitization 
in october  certain of our european subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization facility euro securitization facility 
through the euro securitization facility  our european subsidiaries may offer to sell and the investor has the option to buy  without recourse  on a monthly basis certain eligible trade accounts receivable  up to a maximum amount of euro million 
our european subsidiaries retain collection and administrative responsibilities for the accounts receivable sold 
the initial term of the euro securitization facility expires in  but may be terminated earlier upon occurrence of certain limited circumstances 
the effective yield rates on the accounts receivable sold are based on monthly eur libor plus 
per annum 
as of december   we sold approximately million of accounts receivable to the euro securitization facility  of which we have retained a million beneficial interest in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet at december  see off balance sheet arrangements for more information 
long term and short term debt 
we conduct most of our financing activities through a centralized financing structure  designed to act as our central treasury  which enables us and our subsidiaries to borrow long term and short term debt more efficiently 
this structure includes a master trust facility  the primary assets of which consist of intercompany loans made to bunge limited and its subsidiaries 
bunge limited s wholly owned financing subsidiaries fund the master trust with long and short term debt obtained from third parties  including through our commercial paper program 
to finance working capital  we use cash flows generated from operations and short term borrowings  including our commercial paper program  and various long term bank facilities and bank credit lines  which are sufficient to meet our business needs 
at december   we had approximately  million of committed borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program  other short term lines of credit and long term credit facilities  all of which are with a number of lending institutions 
of this committed capacity   million was unused and available at december  at december   we had million outstanding under our commercial paper program 
our commercial paper program is our least expensive available short term funding source 
we maintain back up bank credit lines equal to the maximum capacity of our commercial paper program of million 
these credit lines expire in june if we were unable to access the commercial paper market  we would use these bank credit lines  which would be at a higher cost than our commercial paper 
bunge has provided parent level guarantees of the indebtedness under these bank credit lines entered into by its wholly owned subsidiary 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under these back up bank credit lines 
our short term and long term debt decreased by million at december  from december  primarily due to the conversion to bunge limited common shares by the noteholders of our convertible notes due november  as described below 
in july  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes bearing interest at a rate of per year that mature in july the notes were issued by our wholly owned finance subsidiary  bunge limited finance corp  and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by bunge limited 
interest on these unsecured senior notes is payable semi annually in arrears in january and july of each year  commencing in january we used the net proceeds of this offering of million for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness 
in december  we canceled our million european revolving credit agreement 
no material termination fees were incurred as a result of the cancellation 
we determined that the facility was no longer needed given our assessment of present and anticipated liquidity requirements 
in november  we amended our million revolving credit agreement to allow us to borrow euros or us dollars at our discretion 
in october  we announced our intention to redeem for cash on november  the remaining outstanding convertible notes due november  the convertible notes were convertible into common shares of bunge limited for each  principal amount of convertible notes 
this represents a price of per share at which bunge limited common shares would be issued and delivered following conversion 
substantially all holders of the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of million convertible notes converted their notes into an aggregate of  million common shares of bunge limited prior to the redemption date 
through our subsidiaries  we have various other long term debt facilities at fixed and variable interest rates denominated in both us dollars and brazilian reais  most of which mature between and at december   we had million outstanding under these long term debt facilities 
of this amount  at december   million was secured by certain land  property  plant and equipment and investments in our consolidated subsidiaries  having a net carrying value of million 
our credit facilities and certain senior notes require us to comply with specified financial covenants related to minimum net worth  working capital and a maximum debt to capitalization ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  we do not have any ratings downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt 
however  a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to renew existing or to obtain access to new credit facilities in the future and would increase the cost of such facilities to us 
our credit ratings on our unsecured guaranteed senior notes by moody s investors service  inc moody s at december  were baa with outlook stable  and bbb with outlook stable by standard poor s rating services and fitch rating services fitch 
our commercial paper is rated a by standard poor s rating services  p by moody s and f by fitch  and the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings are indexed to these ratings 
we have various outstanding interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million for the purpose of managing our interest rate exposure on a portion of our fixed rate senior notes 
under the terms of the interest rate swaps  we make payments based on six month libor set in arrears  and we receive payments based on fixed interest rates 
accrued interest payable of approximately million relating to these swaps was recorded as an increase to interest expense in the maturity of the interest rate swap agreements correspond with the maturity of the associated fixed rate senior notes 
shareholders equity 
shareholders equity increased to  million at december  from  million at december   as a result of the net income of million  million from the issuance of our common shares upon the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of restricted stock units that had vested  million from the conversion of a portion of the convertible notes and other comprehensive income of million  which includes foreign exchange gains of million 
this increase was partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders of million 
cash flows compared to in  our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased million  reflecting the net impact of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  compared to a million decrease in our cash and cash equivalents balance in our operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in our cash flow from operations has varied depending on the timing of the acquisition of  and the market prices for  our agribusiness commodity inventories  as well as the timing of when such inventories were sold 
in addition  the growth of our business has resulted in the need to increase working capital levels which reduces our cash flow from operations 
historically  our operating activities use cash in the first half of the year due to purchases of the south american harvest  which occurs in march  april and may 
in addition  in the first half of the year we are also building fertilizer inventories in anticipation of sales to farmers who typically purchase the bulk of their fertilizer needs in the second half of the year 
also during the first half of the year  north american and european old crop inventories harvested and purchased in september  october and november of the previous year are at their lowest level 
cash flows in the second half of the year will vary depending upon the amount of advances made to farmers in brazil and the amount of north american and european new crops purchased during the september  october and november harvest periods 
in addition  most of the south american inventories acquired during the march  april and may harvest period have been sold 
the decrease in the cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to the decline in income from operations before income taxes and minority interest and higher levels of operating working capital for compared to cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of included approximately million from the sale of accounts receivable through a new securitization facility 
in  cash flow benefited from the reduction in high soybean prices

we have the option under each lease to purchase the barges or railcars at fixed amounts  based on estimated fair values or to sell the assets 
if we elect to sell  we will receive proceeds up to fixed amounts specified in the agreements 
if the proceeds of such sales are less than the specified fixed amounts  we would be obligated under a guarantee to pay supplemental rent for the deficiency in proceeds up to a maximum of approximately million at december  the operating leases expire through there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under this guarantee 
prior to january   we issued a guarantee to a financial institution related to debt of our joint ventures in argentina  which are our unconsolidated affiliates 
the term of the guarantee is equal to the term of the related financing  which matures in there are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable us to recover any amounts paid under this guarantee

the terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financing arrangements  which can be as short as days or as long as days 
in the event that the customers default on their payments to the institution and we would be required to perform under the guarantees  we have obtained collateral from the customers 
at december   million of these financing arrangements were collateralized by tangible property 
we have determined the fair value of these guarantees to be immaterial at december  in addition  we have issued parent level guarantees for the repayment of certain senior notes and senior credit facilities  which were issued or entered into by our wholly owned subsidiaries  with a carrying amount of  million at december  all outstanding debt related to these guarantees are reflected in our consolidated financial statements included as part of this annual report on form k 
there are no significant restrictions on the ability of bunge limited finance corp 
or any of our other subsidiaries to transfer funds to us 
also  certain of our subsidiaries have provided guarantees of indebtedness of certain of their subsidiaries under certain lines of credit with various institutions 
the total borrowing capacity under these lines of credit was million as of december   of which approximately million of related debt was outstanding as of such date 
accounts receivable securitization facilities in october  certain of our european subsidiaries entered into an accounts receivable securitization facility euro securitization facility 
through the euro securitization facility  our european subsidiaries may offer to sell and the investor has the option to buy  without recourse  on a monthly basis certain eligible trade accounts receivable  up to a maximum amount of euro million 
eligible accounts receivable are based on accounts receivable in certain designated european countries 
we account for the transfers of eligible accounts receivable as sales under sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
our european subsidiaries retain collection and administrative responsibilities for the accounts receivable sold 
at the time an account receivable is sold and title has transferred it is removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the proceeds are reflected in cash provided by operating activities 
the effective yield rates on the accounts receivable sold are based on monthly eur libor plus 
per annum 
we recognized approximately million in related expenses for the year ended december   which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income 
the initial term of the euro securitization facility expires in  but may be terminated earlier upon the occurrence of certain limited circumstances 
our european subsidiaries retain beneficial interests in certain accounts receivable that do not qualify as a sale under sfas no 
the beneficial interests are subordinate to the investor s interests and are valued at historical cost  which approximates fair value 
the beneficial interests are recorded in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we sold approximately million accounts receivable to the euro securitization facility  of which we have retained a million beneficial interest in certain accounts receivable that did not qualify as a sale under the terms of the sfas no 
in addition  we have two other accounts receivable securitization facilities through our wholly owned north american operating subsidiaries 
through agreements with certain financial institutions  we may sell  on a revolving basis  undivided percentage ownership interests undivided interests in designated pools of accounts receivable without recourse up to a maximum amount of approximately million 
collections reduce accounts receivable included in the pools  and are used to purchase new receivables  which become part of the pools 
one of the facilities expires in  with an option to renew  and the other facility expires in the effective yield rates approximate the day commercial paper rate plus annual commitment fees ranging from to basis points 
during and  the outstanding undivided interests averaged million and million  respectively  under these north american securitization facilities 
we retain collection and administrative responsibilities for the accounts receivable in the pools 
bunge recognized million  million and million in related expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively  which are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
in addition  we retain interests in the pools of accounts receivable not sold under these securitization facilities 
due to the short term nature of the accounts receivable  our retained interests in the pools are valued at historical cost  which approximate fair value 
the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been retained in our consolidated balance sheets since collections of all pooled accounts receivable are first utilized to reduce the outstanding undivided interests 
accounts receivable at december  were net of million representing the outstanding undivided interests in pooled accounts receivable 
at december   there were no undivided interests in the pooled receivables outstanding 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations and their expected maturities at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in the future periods indicated 
at december  contractual obligations total less than year years years after years us in millions commercial paper borrowings other short term borrowings long term debt fixed interest rate obligations non cancelable lease obligations freight supply agreements inventory purchase commitments total contractual obligations we also have variable interest rate obligations on certain of our outstanding borrowings 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into purchase commitments for time on ocean freight vessels and freight service on railroad lines for the purpose of transporting agricultural commodities 
in addition  we sell time on these ocean freight vessels when excess freight capacity is available 
these agreements range from two months to six years in the case of ocean freight vessels and to years in the case of railroad services 
actual amounts paid under these contracts may differ due to the variable components of these agreements and the amount of income earned by us on the sale of excess capacity 
the railroad freight services agreements require a minimum monthly payment regardless of the actual level of freight services used by us 
the costs of our freight supply agreements are typically passed through to our customers as a component of the prices we charge for our products 
however  changes in the market value of freight compared to the rates at which we have contracted for freight may affect margins on the sales of agricultural commodities 
employee benefit plans we expect to contribute million to our defined benefit pension plans and million to our postretirement healthcare benefit plans in critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iii of this annual report on form k 
allowances for uncollectible accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers and record allowances for uncollectible accounts if we have determined that collection is doubtful 
we base our determination of the allowance for uncollectible accounts on analyses of credit quality for specific accounts  historical trends of charge offs and recoveries  the economic and financial condition of the farming industry and other market conditions 
different assumptions  changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of our customers could result in additional provisions to the allowance for uncollectible accounts and an increase in bad debt expense 
at december   our allowances for uncollectible trade accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers were million and million  respectively 
at december   our allowances for uncollectible trade accounts receivable and secured advances to suppliers were million and million  respectively 
the increase in bad debt was primarily in the fertilizer segment 
we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and will adjust these reserves in the future depending upon significant changes in circumstances 
recoverable taxes we evaluate the collectibility of our recoverable taxes and record valuation allowances if we determine that collection is doubtful 
recoverable taxes primarily represent value added taxes paid on the acquisition of raw materials and other services which can be recovered in cash or as compensation of outstanding balances against income taxes or certain other taxes we may owe 
management s assumption about the collectibility of recoverable taxes requires significant judgment because it involves an assessment of the ability and willingness of the applicable federal or local government to refund the taxes 
the balance of these allowances fluctuates depending on the sales activity of existing inventories  purchases of new inventories  seasonality  changes in applicable tax rates  cash payment by the applicable government agencies and compensation of outstanding balances against income or certain other taxes owed to the applicable governments 
at december   the allowance for recoverable taxes was million 
we continue to monitor the economic environment and events taking place in the applicable countries and will adjust these reserves in the future depending upon significant changes in circumstances 
agricultural commodity derivatives to the extent we consider it prudent for minimizing risk  we use exchange traded futures and options contracts to minimize the effect of price fluctuations on agricultural commodity transactions 
the futures and options contracts that we use for hedging are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges 
we also manage risk by entering into fixed price purchase contracts with pre approved producers and establishing limits for individual suppliers 
fixed price sales contracts are entered into with customers with acceptable creditworthiness  as determined by us 
the fair values of futures and options contracts are determined primarily from quotes listed on the applicable commodity exchanges 
fixed price purchase and sales contracts are with various counterparties and the fair value of such contracts are determined from the market price of the underlying product 
we are exposed to loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these contracts 
the risk of nonperformance is routinely monitored and provisions recorded if necessary to account for potential nonperformance 
different assumptions  changes in economic circumstances or the deterioration of the financial condition of the counterparties to these contracts could result in additional provisions and increased expense reflected in cost of goods sold 
intangible assets and long lived assets long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the projected future cash flows to be generated by such assets 
if it appears that the carrying value of our assets is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss as a charge against results of operations 
our judgments related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amount of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  changes in these factors could cause us to realize material impairment charges 
in  we recorded a pretax impairment charge in our agribusiness segment of million relating to certain south american oilseed processing facilities which have been closed due to a deteriorating operating environment due to industry over capacity and million relating to an oilseed processing plant in india 
in addition  we expect to close three additional oilseed processing plant in brazil in the first quarter of  which will result in asset impairment and restructuring charges related to those closures  the amount of which has not yet been determined 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the costs of businesses acquired over the fair market value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually 
in assessing the recovery of goodwill  projections regarding estimated discounted future cash flows  market place data and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the reporting units and the respective assets 
these projections are based on historical data  anticipated market conditions and management plans 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual impairment test and determined that there were no impairments of goodwill 
contingencies we are a party to a large number of claims and lawsuits  primarily tax and labor claims in brazil  arising in the normal course of business  and have accrued our estimate of the probable costs to resolve these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel and is based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies relating to these proceedings 
for more information on tax and labor claims in brazil  please see item legal proceedings 
employee benefit plans we sponsor various pension and postretirement benefit plans 
in connection with the plans  we make various assumptions in the determination of projected benefit obligations and expense recognition related to pension and postretirement obligations 
key assumptions include discount rates  rates of return on plan assets  asset allocations and rates of future compensation increases 
management develops its assumptions based on its experience and by reference to market related data 
all assumptions are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary 
our weighted average discount rate assumption used to calculate projected benefit obligations under the plans was at the september  measurement date and was consistent with the rate at the september  measurement date 
our discount rate is based on the us aa rated corporate bonds with similar maturities 
our us based plans represent approximately of total projected benefit obligations 
the weighted average rate of return assumption on assets of funded plans was as of the measurement date and was also consistent with the weighted average rate 
our average targeted assumed asset allocations of equity securities and of fixed income securities consisting primarily of government and corporate debt securities for the significant plans 
in  we recorded a decrease in the additional minimum pension liability which increased shareholders equity by million  net of tax benefit of million due to asset performance of the plans assets resulting in overall improvement in the unfunded status 
future recognition of additional minimum pension liabilities will depend on the actual return on the plans assets and the discount rate 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate on our defined benefit pension plans would increase annual expense and the projected benefit obligation by million and million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the long term return assumptions on our defined benefit pension plan assets would increase or decrease annual pension expense by million 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we are likely to realize 
we consider projections of future taxable income and prudent tax planning strategies to assess the need for and the size of the valuation allowances 
if we determine that we can realize a deferred tax asset in excess of our net recorded amount  we decrease the valuation allowance  thereby increasing net income 
conversely  if we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset  we increase the valuation allowance  thereby decreasing net income 
prior to recording a valuation allowance  our deferred tax assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
however  we have recorded valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively  primarily representing the uncertainty regarding the recoverability of certain net operating loss carry forwards 
the decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance in resulted from the projected utilization of net operating loss carry forwards by our brazilian subsidiaries 
we were able to recognize these operating loss carry forwards because of the legal restructuring of our brazilian subsidiaries  increased statutory taxable income of these subsidiaries caused by the effects of the real appreciation and actions undertaken to recover the net operating loss carry forwards 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determined the liabilities are no longer necessary

 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies that an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective december  for calendar year companies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management as a result of our global operating and financing activities  we are exposed to changes in agricultural commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy and transportation costs which may affect our results of operations and financial position 
we use derivative instruments for the purpose of managing the exposures associated with commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy costs 
while these hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  those fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
the counter parties to these contractual arrangements are primarily major financial institutions or  in the case of commodity futures and options  a commodity exchange 
as a result  credit risk arising from these contracts is not significant and we do not anticipate any significant losses 
our board of directors finance and risk policy committee supervises  reviews and periodically revises our overall risk management policies and risk limits 
commodities risk we operate in many areas of the food industry from agricultural raw materials to the production and sale of branded food products 
as a result  we use and produce various materials  many of which are agricultural commodities  including soybeans  soybean oil  soybean meal  wheat and corn 
agricultural commodities are subject to price fluctuations due to a number of unpredictable factors that may create price risk 
we are also subject to the risk of counter party defaults under forward purchase or sale contracts 
we enter into various derivative contracts  primarily exchange traded futures  with the objective of managing our exposure to adverse price movements in the agricultural commodities used for our business operations 
we have established policies that limit the amount of unhedged fixed price agricultural commodity positions permissible for our operating companies  which are a combination of quantity and value at risk limits 
we measure and review our sensitivity to our net commodities position on a daily basis 
our daily net agricultural commodity position consists of inventory  related purchase and sale contracts  and exchange traded contracts  including those used to hedge portions of our production requirements 
the fair value of that position is a summation of the fair values calculated for each agricultural commodity by valuing each net position at quoted average futures prices for the period 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices 
the results of this analysis  which may differ from actual results  are as follows year ended december  year ended december  us in millions fair value market risk fair value market risk highest long position highest short position currency risk our global operations require active participation in foreign exchange markets 
to reduce the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuations  we follow a policy of hedging net monetary assets and liabilities and transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies applicable to each of our various subsidiaries 
our primary exposure is related to our businesses located in brazil and to a lesser extent  argentina  europe and asia 
we enter into derivative financial instruments  such as foreign currency options  forward contracts and swaps  to limit exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates with respect to our recorded foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and our local currency operating expenses 
we may also hedge other foreign currency exposures as deemed appropriate 
when determining our exposure  we exclude intercompany loans that are deemed to be permanently invested 
the repayments of permanently invested intercompany loans are not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future and therefore are treated as analogous to equity for accounting purposes 
as a result  the foreign exchange gains and losses on these borrowings are excluded from the determination of net income and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the balance of permanently invested intercompany borrowings was  million as of december  and million as of december  included in other comprehensive income loss are foreign exchange gains of million in the year ended december  and foreign exchange gains of million in the year ended december   related to permanently invested intercompany loans 
for risk management purposes and to determine the overall level of hedging required  we further reduce the foreign exchange exposure determined above by the value of our agricultural commodities inventories 
our agricultural commodities inventories  because of their international pricing in us dollars  provide a natural hedge to our currency exposure 
our net currency positions  including currency derivatives  and our market risk  which is the potential loss from an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  are set forth in the following table 
in addition  we have provided an analysis of our foreign currency exposure after reducing the exposure for our agricultural commodities inventory 
actual results may differ from the information set forth below

interest rate risk we issue debt in fixed and floating rate instruments 
we are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
the following table summarizes our total short and long term debt exposure to interest rate risk at december  variable rate debt fixed rate debt total us in millions a hypothetical basis point change in the interest rates of our long term variable rate debt at december  would result in an increase of approximately million or a decrease of approximately million in the fair market value of this debt 
in addition  a hypothetical change in the libor interest rates would result in a change in our interest expense of approximately million 
the change in rates assumes that all long term debt maturing within year is variable rate debt in addition to the debt that carries variable rate interest 
some of our variable rate debt is denominated in currencies other than in us dollars and other interest rate indices  such as igpm 
as such  the hypothetical change in interest rate ignores the impact from any currency movements 
our commercial paper is rated a by standard poor s rating services and p by moody s investors service  inc and the interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings are generally governed by these ratings 
interest rate derivatives in  bunge entered into various interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million maturing in for the purpose of managing its interest rate exposure associated with the million aggregate principal amount senior notes due under the terms of the interest rate swaps  bunge will make payments based on six month libor set in arrears  and will receive payments based on fixed interest rates 
in  bunge entered into various interest rate swap agreements maturing in and for the purpose of managing its interest rate exposure on a portion of our fixed rate debt 
bunge has accounted for these swap agreements as fair value hedges 
the interest rate swaps used by bunge as derivative hedging instruments have been recorded at fair value in other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded currently in earnings 
additionally  the carrying amount of the associated debt is adjusted through earnings for changes in the fair value due to changes in interest rates 
ineffectiveness  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 is recognized to the extent that these two adjustments do not offset 
during  bunge recognized no ineffectiveness related to its interest rate swap hedging instruments 
the derivatives bunge entered into for hedge purposes are assumed to be perfectly effective under the shortcut method of sfas no 
the differential to be paid or received based on changes in interest rates is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense 
the interest rate swaps settle every six months until expiration 
we recognized approximately million of accrued interest as interest expense in the year ended december  and million of accrued interest as a reduction of interest expense in the year ended december  in the condensed consolidated statements of income  relating to our outstanding swap agreements 
the following table summarizes our outstanding interest rate swap agreements as of december  maturity fair value loss december  us in millions total receive fixed pay variable notional amount weighted average variable rate payable weighted average fixed rate receivable interest is payable in arrears based on a forecasted rate of six month libor plus a spread
