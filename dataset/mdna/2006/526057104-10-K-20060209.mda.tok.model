outlook fiscal proved to be a very strong year for lennar and other large national homebuilders  as the pace of price appreciation on new homes drove record level profit margins in various markets 
during fiscal  we accumulated a record level backlog dollar value of new home orders  which at november  was higher than it was at the end of fiscal with communities in place to meet our delivery goals and a backlog of billion as of december   we believe that we are well positioned for fiscal as we enter fiscal  there have been early indications of a slower sales pace in certain markets in which we operate 
while these indicators point to the likelihood that price appreciation in these markets will not continue at the level experienced in fiscal  we believe that in most of these markets  with interest rates reasonably low  employment trends remaining positive and inventory levels only moderately up  our focus on inventory management and excellent land positions should support another record year for our company 
our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity position us well for opportunities  as we focus primarily on growing our company organically 
however  we remain opportunistic towards the acquisition of small and possibly large homebuilders 
in addition to maintaining a strong balance sheet and growing bottom line profitability  we remain focused on achieving strong returns on capital by managing our land portfolio and controlling additional homesites through options and strategic joint ventures 
results of operations overview we achieved record revenues  profits and earnings per share from continuing operations in our net earnings from continuing operations in were billion  or per share diluted per share basic  compared to million  or per share diluted per share basic  in the increase in net earnings from continuing operations was attributable to strength in our homebuilding division s operations 
in particular  both our deliveries and average sales price on homes delivered increased due to strong demand and supply constraints in strategic markets  low interest rates and favorable economic and demographic trends 
earnings per share amounts for all years have been adjusted to reflect the effect of our april class b common stock distribution and our january two for one stock split 
homebuilding our homebuilding division sells and constructs homes primarily for first time  move up and active adult homebuyers 
we sell homes under both our everything s included and design studio sm programs 
our land operations include the purchase  development and sale of land for our homebuilding activities  as well as the sale of land to third parties 
in certain circumstances  we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and minimize our risks by investing with third parties in unconsolidated entities 
the following tables set forth selected financial and operational information for the years indicated 
the results of operations of the homebuilders we acquired during these years are included in the tables since the respective dates of the acquisitions

substantially all of the homes currently in backlog are expected to be delivered in fiscal homes are sold using sales contracts  which are generally accompanied by sales deposits 
in some instances  purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they are unable to close on the sale of their existing home  fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances 
we experienced a cancellation rate of in  compared to and in and  respectively 
although cancellations can delay the sales of our homes  they have not had a material impact on sales  operations or liquidity because we closely monitor our prospective buyers ability to obtain financing and use that information to adjust construction start plans to match anticipated deliveries of homes 
we do not recognize revenue on homes under sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners  except for our mid to high rise condominiums under construction for which revenue is recognized under percentage of completion accounting 
during  we entered metropolitan new york city and the boston and reno  nevada markets and we expanded our presence in our east and west regions through homebuilding acquisitions 
during  we expanded our presence in all of our regions through homebuilding acquisitions 
during  we expanded our operations in california and south carolina through homebuilding acquisitions 
the results of operations of the acquisitions are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates

at november   of the homesites we owned were subject to home purchase contracts 
our backlog of sales contracts was  homes billion at november   compared to  homes billion at november  the higher backlog was primarily attributable to our growth and strong demand for our homes  which resulted in higher new orders in  compared to as a result of acquisitions combined with our organic growth  inventories  excluding consolidated inventory not owned  increased during  while revenues from sales of homes increased for the year ended november   compared to prior year 
versus revenues from home sales increased in to billion from billion in revenues were higher primarily due to a increase in the number of home deliveries and a increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in new home deliveries  excluding unconsolidated entities  increased to  homes in the year ended november  from  homes in in  new home deliveries were higher in each of our regions  compared to the average sales price of homes delivered increased to  in the year ended november  from  in gross margins on home sales were billion  or  in  compared to billion  or  in margins were positively impacted by an improvement in our east and west regions 
this improvement was primarily attributable to favorable pricing conditions  particularly in our land constrained markets  as well as a change in product mix 
this improvement was partially offset by warranty expense related to the resolution of a dispute 
homebuilding interest expense primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold was million in  compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to lower interest costs resulting from a lower debt leverage ratio while we continued to grow

the division sells substantially all of the loans it originates in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released  non recourse basis  however  we remain liable for customary representations and warranties related to loan sales 
the division also provides high speed internet and cable television services to residents of our communities and others 
the following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to our financial services division 
the results of operations of companies we acquired during these years are included in the table since the respective dates of the acquisitions 
financial services division s selected financial and operational data years ended november  dollars in thousands revenues costs and expenses operating earnings from continuing operations dollar value of mortgages originated number of mortgages originated mortgage capture rate of lennar homebuyers number of title and closing service transactions number of title policies issued versus operating earnings from continuing operations for the financial services division were million in the year ended november   compared to million last year 
the decrease was primarily due to reduced profitability from the division s mortgage operations as a result of a more competitive mortgage environment in  as well as a million pretax gain generated from monetizing a majority of the division s alarm monitoring contracts in this decrease was partially offset by improved profitability from the division s title operations in the division s mortgage capture rate ie  the percentage of our homebuyers  excluding cash settlements  who obtained mortgage financing from us in areas where we offered services was in the year ended november   compared to the decrease in the capture rate was a result of a more competitive mortgage environment 
during  we sold north american exchange company naec  a subsidiary of the financial services division s title company  which generated a million pretax gain 
versus operating earnings from continuing operations from our financial services division decreased to million in  compared to million in the decrease in operating earnings from continuing operations in was primarily due to a more competitive mortgage environment and a slowdown in refinance activity  which resulted in reduced profitability from our mortgage and title operations 
the decline in operating earnings from continuing operations was partially offset by a million gain generated by monetizing the majority of our alarm monitoring contracts in the division s mortgage capture rate ie  the percentage of our homebuyers  excluding cash settlements  who obtained mortgage financing from us in areas where we offered services was relatively consistent in the year ended november   compared to corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in the year ended november  and in both the years ended november  and financial condition and capital resources at november   we had cash related to our homebuilding and financial services operations of billion  compared to billion at november  the decrease in cash was primarily due to an increase in inventories  contributions to unconsolidated entities  repurchases of common stock and acquisitions partially offset by our net earnings  distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities and proceeds from debt issuances as we position ourselves for future growth 
we finance our land acquisition and development activities  construction activities  financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from our operations and public debt issuances  as well as cash borrowed under our revolving credit facility and warehouse lines of credit 
operating cash flow activities during and  cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to million and million  respectively 
during  cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings  an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities and distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities partially offset by an increase in inventories due to an increase in construction in progress to support a significantly higher backlog and land purchases to facilitate future growth  an increase in receivables resulting primarily from land sales and equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities 
during  cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings  distributions of earnings from unconsolidated entities  a decrease in financial services loans held for sale and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities offset in part by an increase in inventories to support a significantly higher backlog and an increase in receivables resulting primarily from land sales 
in particular  inventories increased by million during due to an increased number of home starts to support a significantly higher backlog combined with the accelerated takedown of homesites that had been under option 
investing cash flow activities cash flows used in investing activities totaled billion during  compared to million in in  we used million of cash for acquisitions  million of cash was contributed to unconsolidated entities and we had an increase in financial services loans held for investment of million 
this usage of cash was partially offset by million of distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities 
in  we used million of cash for acquisitions and million of cash was contributed to unconsolidated entities 
in particular  we contributed approximately million to an unconsolidated entity to fund the entity s purchase of newhall 
this usage of cash was partially offset by million of distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities 
during  we entered metropolitan new york city and the boston and reno  nevada markets and we expanded our presence in our east and west regions through homebuilding acquisitions 
the results of operations of these acquisitions are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates 
we are always looking at the possibility of acquiring homebuilders and other companies 
however  at november   we had no agreements or understandings regarding any significant transactions 
financing cash flow activities homebuilding debt to total capital is a financial measure commonly used in the homebuilding industry and is presented to assist in understanding the leverage of our homebuilding operations 
by providing a measure of leverage of our homebuilding operations  management believes that this measure enables readers of our financial statements to better understand our financial position and performance 
homebuilding debt to total capital as of november  and is calculated as follows dollars in thousands homebuilding debt stockholders equity total capital homebuilding debt to total capital the ratio at november  was consistent with the ratio in the prior year 
in addition to the use of capital in our homebuilding and financial services operations  we actively evaluate various other uses of capital  which fit into our homebuilding and financial services strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital goals 
this may include acquisitions of  or investments in  other entities  the payment of dividends or repurchases of our outstanding common stock or debt 
these activities may be funded through any combination of our credit facilities  cash generated from operations  sales of assets or the issuance of public debt  common stock or preferred stock 
the following table summarizes our homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable november  dollars in thousands zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior floating rate notes due senior floating rate notes due mortgage notes on land and other debt our average debt outstanding was billion in  compared to billion in the average rates for interest incurred were in  compared to in interest incurred for the year ended november  was million  compared to million in the majority of our short term financing needs  including financings for land acquisition and development activities and general operating needs  are met with cash generated from operations and funds available under our new unsecured credit facility the new facility  which replaced our senior unsecured credit facilities the credit facilities in june the new facility consists of a billion revolving credit facility maturing in june the new facility also includes access to an additional million via an accordion feature  under which the new facility may be increased to billion  subject to additional commitments 
we repaid the outstanding balance under the credit facilities with borrowings under the new facility 
as of november   the commitment under the new facility s revolving credit facility was increased by million via access of the accordion feature  reducing the access to additional commitments under the accordion feature to million as of november  subsequent to november   we received the remaining additional commitments of million under the accordion feature increasing the new facility to billion 
the new facility is guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries which include mortgage and title insurance subsidiaries 
interest rates on outstanding borrowings are libor based  with margins determined based on changes in our leverage ratio and credit ratings  or an alternate base rate 
at november   no amounts were outstanding under the new facility 
during the year ended november   the average daily borrowings under the credit facilities and the new facility were million 
we have a structured letter of credit facility the lc facility with a financial institution 
the purpose of the lc facility is to facilitate the issuance of up to million of letters of credit on a senior unsecured basis 
in connection with the lc facility  the financial institution issued million of its senior notes  which are linked to our performance on the lc facility 
if there is an event of default under the lc facility  including our failure to reimburse a draw against an issued letter of credit  the financial institution would assign its claim against us  to the extent of the amount due and payable by us under the lc facility  to its noteholders in lieu of their principal repayment on their performance linked notes 
in june  we entered into a letter of credit facility with a financial institution 
the purpose of the letter of credit facility is to facilitate the issuance of up to million of letters of credit on a senior unsecured basis through the facility s expiration date of june at november   we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of billion  which includes million outstanding under the lc facility and million outstanding under the letter of credit facility entered into in june the majority of these letters of credit are posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities or are posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts 
of our total letters of credit outstanding  million were collateralized against certain borrowings available under the new facility 
in april  we sold million of senior notes due the senior notes at a price of 
substitute registered notes were subsequently issued 
proceeds from the offering  after initial purchaser s discount and expenses  were million 
we added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes 
interest on the senior notes is due semi annually 
the senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated 
substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries guaranteed the senior notes 
in may  we redeemed all of our outstanding senior notes due the notes 
the redemption price was million  or of the principal amount of the notes outstanding  plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date 
the redemption of the notes resulted in a million pretax loss 
in july  we sold an additional million of senior notes at a price of 
the senior notes were the same issue as the senior notes we sold in april proceeds from the offering  after initial purchaser s discount and expenses  were million 
we added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes 
interest on the senior notes is due semi annually 
the senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated 
substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries guaranteed the senior notes 
at november   the carrying value of the senior notes sold in april and july was million 
in september  we sold million of senior notes due the new senior notes at a price of in a private placement 
proceeds from the offering  after initial purchaser s discount and expenses  were million 
we added the proceeds to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes 
interest on the new senior notes is due semi annually 
the new senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated 
substantially all of our subsidiaries other than finance company subsidiaries guaranteed the new senior notes 
we have agreed to exchange the new senior notes for registered notes 
the registered notes will have substantially identical terms as the new senior notes  except that the registered notes will not include transfer restrictions that are applicable to the new senior notes 
at november   the carrying value of the new senior notes was million 
in march and april  we issued a total of million of senior floating rate notes due the floating rate notes in a registered offering  which are callable at par beginning in march proceeds from the offerings  after underwriting discount and expenses  were million 
we used the proceeds to partially prepay the term loan b portion of the credit facilities and added the remainder to our working capital to be used for general corporate purposes 
we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of the term loan b with cash from our working capital 
interest on the floating rate notes is three month libor plus as of november  and is payable quarterly  compared to the term loan b interest of three month libor plus 
the floating rate notes are unsecured and unsubordinated 
at november   the carrying value of the floating rate notes was million 
substantially all of our subsidiaries  other than finance company subsidiaries  have guaranteed the floating rate notes 
in august  we sold million of senior notes due at a price of in a private placement 
proceeds from the offering  after initial purchaser s discount and expenses  were million 
we used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our credit facilities 
interest on the senior notes is due semi annually 
the senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated 
substantially all of our subsidiaries  other than finance company subsidiaries  guaranteed the senior notes 
at november   the carrying value of the senior notes was million 
we also sold million of senior floating rate notes due in a private placement 
the senior floating rate notes are callable at par beginning in february proceeds from the offering  after initial purchaser s discount and expenses  were million 
we used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our credit facilities 
interest on the senior floating rate notes is three month libor plus as of november  and is payable quarterly 
the senior floating rate notes are unsecured and unsubordinated 
substantially all of our subsidiaries  other than finance company subsidiaries  guaranteed the senior floating rate notes 
at november   the carrying value of the senior floating rate notes was million 
substantially all of our subsidiaries  other than finance company subsidiaries  have guaranteed all our senior notes and floating rate notes the guaranteed notes 
the guarantees are full and unconditional and the guarantor subsidiaries are directly and indirectly owned by lennar corporation 
the principal reason our subsidiaries  other than finance company subsidiaries  guaranteed the guaranteed notes is so holders of the guaranteed notes will have rights at least as great with regard to our subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of our unsecured debt 
therefore  the guarantees of the guaranteed notes will remain in effect while the guarantor subsidiaries guarantee a material amount of the debt of lennar corporation  as a separate entity  to others 
at any time  however  when a guarantor subsidiary is no longer guaranteeing at least million of lennar corporation s debt other than the guaranteed notes  either directly or by guaranteeing other subsidiaries obligations as guarantors of lennar corporation s debt  guarantor subsidiaries guarantee of the guaranteed notes will be suspended 
currently  the only debt the guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing other than the guaranteed notes is lennar corporation s principal revolving bank credit line 
therefore  if  the guarantor subsidiaries cease guaranteeing lennar corporation s obligations under the principal revolving bank credit line and are not guarantors of any new debt  the guarantor subsidiaries guarantees of the guaranteed notes will be suspended until such time  if any  as they again are guaranteeing at least million of lennar corporation s debt other than the guaranteed notes 
if the guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing the revolving credit line totaling at least million  we will treat the guarantees of the guaranteed notes as remaining in effect even during periods when lennar corporation s borrowings under the revolving credit line is less than million 
because it is possible that our banks will permit some or all of the guarantor subsidiaries to stop guaranteeing the revolving credit line  it is possible that  at some time or times in the future  the guaranteed notes will no longer be guaranteed by the guarantor subsidiaries 
at november   our financial services division had warehouse lines of credit totaling billion to fund our mortgage loan activities 
borrowings under the facilities were billion at november  and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold but not yet funded by the investor with outstanding principal balances of billion 
there are several interest rate pricing options  which fluctuate with market rates 
the effective interest rate on the facilities at november  was 
the warehouse lines of credit mature in august million and in april million  at which time we expect the facilities to be renewed 
at november   we had advances under a conduit funding agreement with a major financial institution amounting to million 
borrowings under this agreement are collateralized by mortgage loans and had an effective interest rate of at november  we also had a million revolving line of credit with a bank that matures in august  at which time the division expects the line of credit to be renewed 
the line of credit is collateralized by certain assets of the division and stock of certain title subsidiaries 
borrowings under the line of credit were million and had an effective interest rate of at november  we have various interest rate swap agreements  which effectively convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on million of outstanding debt related to our homebuilding operations 
the interest rate swaps mature at various dates through fiscal and fix the libor index to which certain of our debt interest rates are tied at an average interest rate of at november  the net effect on our operating results is that interest on the variable rate debt being hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates 
counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions 
at november   the fair market value of the interest rate swaps was a million liability 
our financial services division  in the normal course of business  uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the division enters into forward commitments and  to a lesser extent  option contracts to protect the value of loans held for sale from increases in market interest rates 
we do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non performance 
we have met all of our quantifiable debt covenants 
there have been no significant changes in liquidity from the balance sheet date to the date of issuance of this annual report on form k  except as noted above related to the remaining additional commitments of million received under the accordion feature increasing the new facility to billion 
changes in capital structure in january  we effected a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend of class a and class b common stock 
all share and per share amounts except authorized shares  treasury shares and par value have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the split 
there was no net effect on total stockholders equity as a result of the stock split 
in june  our board of directors authorized our stock repurchase program to permit future purchases of up to million shares adjusted for the january two for one stock split of our outstanding common stock 
during  we repurchased a total of million shares of our outstanding class a common stock under our stock repurchase program for an aggregate purchase price of million  or per share 
as of november   million shares of our common stock can be repurchased in the future under the program 
in addition to the class a common shares purchased under our stock repurchase program  we repurchased approximately  class a common shares related to the vesting of restricted stock and distributions of common stock from our deferred compensation plan during the year ended november  in september  our board of directors voted to increase the annual dividend rate with regard to our class a and class b common stock to per share per year payable quarterly from per share per year payable quarterly 
dividend rates reflect our january two for one stock split 
in recent years  we have sold convertible and non convertible debt into public markets  and at year end  we had a shelf registration statement effective under the securities act of  as amended  under which we could sell to the public up to billion of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock or other securities 
at november   we had another shelf registration statement effective under the securities act of  as amended  under which we could issue up to million of equity or debt securities in connection with acquisitions of companies or interests in companies  businesses or assets 
based on our current financial condition and credit relationships  we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of growth 
off balance sheet arrangements we strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or for the construction of homes for sale to third party homebuyers 
through these entities  we reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land  while increasing access to potential future homesites 
the use of these entities also  in some instances  enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access  or could not obtain access on as favorable terms  without the participation of a strategic partner 
our partners in these entities generally are unrelated homebuilders  land sellers and financial or other strategic partners 
most of the entities in which we invest are accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
at november   our recorded investment in unconsolidated entities was billion and our estimated maximum exposure to loss with regard to unconsolidated entities was our recorded investments in these entities in addition to the exposure under the guarantees discussed below 
in many instances  we are appointed as the day to day manager of these entities and receive fees for performing this function 
during  and  we received management fees and reimbursement of expenses totaling million  million and million  respectively  from unconsolidated entities in which we had investments 
we and or our partners sometimes obtain options or enter into other arrangements under which we can purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated entities 
option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair market value when we receive the options 
during  and  million  million and million  respectively  of the unconsolidated entities revenues were from land sales to our homebuilding divisions 
we do not include in our equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities our pro rata share of unconsolidated entities earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions 
instead  we account for those earnings as a reduction of our cost of purchasing the land from the unconsolidated entities 
this in effect defers recognition of our share of the unconsolidated entities earnings related to these sales until we deliver a home and title passes to a homebuyer 
summarized operating results for unconsolidated entities in which we had investments were as follows years ended november  dollars in thousands revenues costs and expenses net earnings of unconsolidated entities our share of net earnings our share of net earnings recognized our share of net earnings deferred our investment in unconsolidated entities equity of the unconsolidated entities our investment in the unconsolidated entities at november   the unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of billion and total liabilities of billion  which included billion of notes and mortgages payable 
in some instances  we and or our partners have provided guarantees of debt of certain unconsolidated entities on a pro rata basis 
at november   we had repayment guarantees of million and limited maintenance guarantees of million related to unconsolidated entity debt 
the fair market value of the repayment guarantees is insignificant 
when we and or our partners provide guarantees  the unconsolidated entity generally receives more favorable terms from its lenders than would otherwise be available to it 
the limited maintenance guarantees only apply if an unconsolidated entity defaults on its loan arrangements and the value of the collateral generally land and improvements is less than a specified percentage of the loan balance 
if we are required to make a payment under a limited maintenance guarantee to bring the value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance  the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds it distributes 
at november   there were no assets held as collateral that  upon the occurrence of any triggering event or condition under a guarantee  we could obtain and liquidate to recover all or a portion of the amounts to be paid under a guarantee 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at november  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable financial services notes and other debts payable including limited purpose finance subsidiaries interest commitments under interest bearing debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations we are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts including option contracts for the purchase  development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business 
option contracts for the purchase of land generally enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we are ready to build homes on them 
this reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings 
at november   we had access to acquire approximately  homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments 
at november   we had million of non refundable option deposits and advanced costs related to certain of these homesites 
we are committed  under various letters of credit  to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business 
outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled billion at november  additionally  we had outstanding performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects with estimated costs to complete of billion 
we do not believe there will be any draws upon these bonds  but if there were any  they would not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our financial services division had a pipeline of loans in process totaling approximately billion at november  to minimize credit risk  we use the same credit policies in the approval of our commitments as are applied to our lending activities 
loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately million as of november  substantially all of these commitments were for periods of days or less 
since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers  the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
our financial services division uses mandatory mortgage backed securities mbs forward commitments and mbs option contracts to hedge its interest rate exposure during the period from when it extends an interest rate lock to a loan applicant until the time at which the loan is sold to an investor 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk 
credit risk is managed by entering into mbs forward commitments and mbs option contracts only with investment banks with primary dealer status and loan sales transactions with permanent investors meeting our credit standards 
our risk  in the event of default by the purchaser  is the difference between the contract price and fair market value 
at november   we had open commitments amounting to million to sell mbs with varying settlement dates through february economic conditions during  the homebuilding environment remained strong due to a positive supply demand relationship  as well as low interest rates 
as a result of this favorable environment and growth in the number of our active communities  our new orders increased by in although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical  it has not undergone an economic down cycle in a number of years 
further  during  home prices rose significantly in many of our markets 
this has led some people to assert that the prices of land  new homes and the stock prices of homebuilding companies may be inflated and may decline if the demand for new homes weakens 
a decline in the prices for new homes could adversely affect both our revenues and margins 
a decline in our stock price could make raising capital through stock issuances more difficult and expensive 
market and financing risk we finance our contributions to joint ventures  land acquisition and development activities  construction activities  financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and public debt issuances  as well as cash borrowed under our revolving credit facility and warehouse lines of credit 
we also purchase land under option agreements  which enables us to acquire homesites when we are ready to build homes on them 
the financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings are managed by prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets  careful management of the land development process and limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land  as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts 
seasonality we have historically experienced variability in our results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business 
we typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first half of the calendar year  although the rate of orders for new homes is highly dependent on the number of active communities and the timing of new community openings 
we typically have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year compared to the first half because new home deliveries trail orders for new homes by several months 
as a result  our revenues and operating earnings from sales of homes are generally higher in the second half of our fiscal year 
interest rates and changing prices inflation can have a long term impact on us because increasing costs of land  materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes 
in addition  inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates  which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction 
rising interest rates  as well as increased materials and labor costs  may reduce gross margins 
in recent years  the increases in these costs have followed the general rate of inflation and hence have not had a significant adverse impact on us 
in addition  deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs 
therefore  either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp 
the american jobs creation act  which was signed into law in october  provides a tax deduction on qualified domestic production activities 
when fully phased in  the deduction will be up to of the lesser of qualified production activities income or taxable income 
based on the guidance provided by fsp  this deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and will reduce tax expense in the period or periods that the amounts are deductible on the tax return 
fsp was effective december  and the tax benefit resulting from the new deduction will be effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year  which begins december  we are evaluating the impact of this law on our future financial statements and currently estimate the future reduction in our federal income tax rate to be approximately basis points

sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year beginning december  
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this document 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application 
homebuilding operations revenue recognition revenues from sales of homes are recognized when sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners 
revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received  the earnings process is complete  title passes and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition 
effective december   as a result of the determination that we met all applicable requirements under sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  we began to apply the percentage of completion method to our mid to high rise condominiums under construction 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we record a portion of the value of condominium home contracts as revenue when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a full refund except for non delivery of the home  sufficient homes have already been sold to assure the entire property will not revert to rental property  sales prices are collectible and aggregate sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method is calculated based upon the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs to complete  and is adjusted for estimated cancellations due to potential customer defaults 
the change to the percentage of completion method did not have a material impact on our financial condition as of november   or our results of operations or cash flows for the year ended november  actual revenues and costs to complete construction in the future could differ from our current estimates 
if our estimates of revenues and development costs change  then our revenues  cost of sales and related cumulative profits will be revised in the period that estimates change 
inventories inventories are stated at cost  unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired  in which case the impaired inventory would be written down to fair market value 
inventory costs include land  land development and home construction costs  real estate taxes  deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction 
land  land development  amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas 
we evaluate our inventory for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from an asset is less than the reported value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of impairment to recognize is calculated by subtracting the fair market value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change due to the assumptions about future sales and cost of sales and the impact of recognizing impairments on the assets reported in our consolidated balance sheets  as well as our net earnings  could be material 
our assumptions about future home sales prices and volumes require significant judgment because historically the residential homebuilding industry has been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical  it has not undergone a down cycle in a number of years 
no material impairment charges were recorded during the years ended november   and while no material impairment existed as of november   there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy  might not lead to an impairment of inventory 
warranty costs although we subcontract virtually all segments of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trade  we are primarily responsible to correct any deficiencies 
additionally  in some instances  we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors 
warranty reserves are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home 
reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment 
at november   the reserve for warranty costs was million 
while we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs 
additionally  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 
investments in unconsolidated entities we frequently invest in entities that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders  land sellers and financial or other strategic partners 
most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary  as defined under fasb interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  and we have a significant  but less than controlling  interest in the entities 
we record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities  as described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
advances to these entities are included in the investment balance 
management uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of  or have a controlling interest in  an unconsolidated entity 
factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing  experience and financial condition of the other partners  voting rights  involvement in day to day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement 
the accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence 
as of november   we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest  but rather share control with our partners 
at november   the unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of billion and total liabilities of billion 
financial services operations revenue recognition loan origination revenues  net of direct origination costs  are recognized when the related loans are sold 
gains and losses from the sale of loans and loan servicing rights are recognized when the loans are sold and shipped to an investor 
premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective dates of the policies 
escrow fees are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed  usually upon the close of escrow 
interest income on loans held for sale is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates 
in all circumstances  we do not recognize revenue until the earnings process is complete and collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue recognition 
allowance for loan losses we provide an allowance for loan losses when and if we determine that loans or portions of them are not likely to be collected 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  we consider various factors such as past loan loss experience  regulatory examinations  present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by management 
anticipated changes in economic conditions  which may influence the level of the allowance  are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined 
this analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers financial conditions or prospects 
at november   the allowance for loan losses was million 
while we believe that the year end allowance was adequate  particularly in view of the fact that we usually sell the loans in the secondary mortgage market on a non recourse basis within days after we originate them  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy  might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher occurrence of loan charge offs 
this allowance requires management s judgment and estimate 
for these reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate 
homebuilding and financial services operations goodwill valuation goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of net assets acquired 
the process of determining goodwill requires judgment 
evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair market value of our reporting units 
inherent in such fair market value determinations are certain judgments and estimates  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change  which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
for those reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate 
we review goodwill annually or more frequently under certain conditions for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of september  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
at november   goodwill was million 
while we believe that no impairment existed as of november   there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments  including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy  might not lead to an impairment of goodwill 
valuation of deferred tax assets we record income taxes under the asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 
we believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and  in certain cases  business plans and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events 
although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates  we believe it is unlikely such changes would have a material period to period impact on our financial position or results of operations 
at november   our net deferred tax asset was million 
based on our assessment  it appears more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings 
stock based compensation with the approval of a committee consisting of members of our board of directors  from time to time we issue to employees options to purchase our common stock
