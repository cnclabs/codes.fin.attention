item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial information and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the years ended december    and included with this report 
the following information contains forward looking statements  see forward looking statements on page of this report 
overview swift energy had record net income  cash flow  and production for net income increased to million and cash flow increased to million over net income and cash flow 
production increased to bcfe over production 
we also had record revenues of million for  an increase of over levels  and became the largest crude oil producer in louisiana 
swift energy also dealt with challenges presented by the damage and disruption caused by hurricanes katrina and rita in the last half of we ended with total proved reserves of bcfe  a decrease of from year end levels 
revenues  production levels  and reserves for were lower than our pre hurricane guidance as a result of production shut ins and deferred drilling necessitated by hurricanes katrina and then rita 
we estimate that the effect of these hurricanes deferred approximately to bcfe of production and deferred the drilling of approximately to domestic wells into our weighted average sales price increased to per mcfe for from in the strong commodity prices during supported the increase in our revenues as compared to despite the impact of the hurricanes on production volumes 
our efforts and capital throughout remained primarily focused on infrastructure improvements  increased production  and the development of long lived reserves through exploration and exploitation activities primarily in our four regions south louisiana  south texas  toledo bend  and new zealand 
we expect to continue this focus throughout we are reviewing further potential capacity increase of the facilities in lake washington  and expect the new d seismic over the cote blanche island area to be completed in the third quarter of  and plan to acquire seismic on our offshore kaheru exploration permit in new zealand 
our overall costs and expenses increased in  and we expect to manage our costs and expenses to remain at this level in the largest increase in these costs and expenses is due to increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense as a result of increased estimates for future development costs and additional capital expenditures during we experienced higher costs due to increased oil production in lake washington  along with higher severance taxes due to increased revenues 
we also saw an increase in our general and administrative expenses due to an increased workforce and stock compensation expense associated with the issuance of restricted stock 
although our lease operating costs were less than originally anticipated through the first six months of  due to lower than expected chemical  repair and maintenance costs as well as no significant work over activity  lease operating costs were adversely affected in the second half of due to hurricanes katrina and rita 
during the last half of  we recorded approximately million of costs related to hurricane katrina and million related to hurricane rita  and we expect additional hurricane related costs to be incurred in approximately million of the total costs were expensed to lease operating expense  net of estimated insurance reimbursement  in the remainder of the costs related to capital projects 
we expect cost pressures to continue to affect the industry throughout  especially along the gulf coast following the hurricanes  with tightening availability of crews as well as increasing costs of services and basic equipment 
year end proved reserves of bcfe  representing a decline for the year  were crude oil  natural gas and ngls  compared to year end proved reserves of bcfe  which were crude oil  natural gas and ngls 
proved developed reserves decreased slightly to of total reserves at year end  compared to the previous year 
domestic proved reserves decreased at year end to bcfe and included the acquisition of reserves in the south bearhead creek field  which was predominantly proved undeveloped 
proved reserves in new zealand decreased to bcfe at year end  primarily attributable to production and downward revisions in the kauri sands in the rimu kauri area 
in  we focused our drilling activity  both domestically and in new zealand  on proved undeveloped locations that helped maximize production in a high price environment  but which also resulted in smaller additions to proved reserves 
our financial position remains strong and flexible  allowing us to take advantage of future opportunities in organic growth through drilling and strategic growth through acquisitions 
our financial ratios have also continued 
table of contents to improve 
our debt to pv ratio decreased to at december  compared to at december   due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices and a slight decrease in our total debt 
higher commodity prices have increased our pv value 
our debt to capitalization ratio was at december  compared to at year end  as debt levels decreased slightly in and retained earnings increased as a result of the current period profit 
including our cash on hand at year end  our net debt to capital ratio would have been and our net debt per mcfe would be per mcfe 
there are a number of factors that support our belief that swift energy s performance for will be strong 
we think that strong commodity prices will continue over the foreseeable future  based in part on forward strip pricing 
although production was impacted by the hurricane activity in the second half of  all of swift energy s operations in the south louisiana region are back on production at or above pre katrina production levels  except for the cote blanche island field  and the major facility expansion projects at the lake washington area are in the final commissioning stages 
cote blanche island is expected to be back online by the end of the first quarter of our merged d seismic data offsets around our fields in southern louisiana has yielded success in our exploration and development activities  as demonstrated by our year end drilling successes at our newport and bondi prospects in the lake washington area 
continued work over and recompletion activity is expected to take place in  particularly in the bay de chene and cote blanche island fields in southern louisiana  however  this work has been delayed somewhat due to our recovery efforts from hurricanes katrina and rita 
we ve also acquired additional property in our toledo bend region during the fourth quarter of  the south bearhead creek property 
the piakau discovery in new zealand has yielded positive results  although further reservoir delineation is required 
our diversified drilling portfolio positions us for higher impact exploration drilling as well as expanded exploitation efforts in results of operations years ended   and revenues 
our revenues in increased by compared to revenues in  and our revenues in increased by compared to revenues due primarily to increases in each successive year in oil and natural gas prices and in production from our lake washington and rimu kauri areas 
revenues from our oil and gas sales comprised substantially all of total revenues for   and crude oil production was of our production volumes in  in  and in natural gas production was of our production volumes in  in  and in domestic production was of our total production volumes in both and  and in the following table provides information regarding the changes in the sources of our oil and gas sales and volumes for the years ended december    and oil and gas oil and gas sales sales volume in millions bcfe area awp olmos brookeland lake washington masters creek other total domestic rimu kauri tawn total new zealand total oil and gas sales in increased by  or million  from the level of those revenues for  and our net sales volumes in increased by  or bcfe  over net sales volumes in average prices for oil increased to per bbl in from per bbl in average natural gas prices increased to per mcf in from per mcf in average ngl prices increased to per bbl in from per bbl in

our expenses in increased million  or  compared to expenses 
the majority of the increase was due to a million increase in dd a  an million increase in severance and other taxes  and a million increase in lease operating costs  all of which are primarily due to increased commodity prices and production volumes in this increase was partially offset by the absence of million of debt retirement costs incurred in our expenses in increased million  or  compared to expenses 
the majority of the increase was due to an million increase in dd a  an million increase in severance and other taxes  and a million increase in lease operating costs  all of which were primarily due to increased production volumes and oil and gas commodity prices in 
table of contents our general and administrative expenses  net  increased million  or  from the level of such expenses in  while general and administrative expenses  net  increased million  or  over levels 
the increase in both and were primarily due to increased salaries and burdens associated with our expanded workforce and the expensing of restricted stock compensation in a portion of the increase in costs was also attributable to sarbanes oxley act compliance costs increasing over the prior year 
these costs  while remaining high  have stabilized from to for the years   and  our capitalized general and administrative costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
our net general and administrative expenses per mcfe produced increased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in and per mcfe in our cost per mcfe was adversely affected by the approximate to bcfe of production that was deferred  and not produced in  because of hurricanes katrina and rita 
the portion of supervision fees recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses was million for  million for  and million for dd a increased million  or  in from levels  while dd a increased million  or  from levels 
domestically  dd a increased million in due to increases in the depletable oil and gas property base  slightly higher production in the period and lower reserves volumes 
in new zealand  dd a increased by million in due to the same reasons 
in  our domestic dd a increased by million due to increases in the depletable oil and gas property base  higher production in the period and slightly lower reserves volumes 
our new zealand dd a increased by million in due to increases in the depletable oil and gas property base along with lower reserves volumes  partially offset by lower production in the period 
our dd a rate per mcfe of production was in  in  and in  resulting from increases in per unit cost of reserves additions 
we recorded million  million  and million of accretions to our asset retirement obligation in   and  respectively 
our lease operating costs per mcfe produced were in  in and in our cost per mcfe was adversely affected by the approximate to bcfe of production that was deferred  and not produced in  because of hurricanes katrina and rita 
there were no supervision fees recorded as a reduction to production costs in or  while there were million in our lease operating costs in increased million  or  over the level of such expenses in  while costs increased million  or over levels 
approximately million of the increase in lease operating costs during was related to our domestic operations  which increased primarily due to hurricane related costs  along with increased oil production from our lake washington area 
our lease operating cost in new zealand increased in by million due to increases in plant operating costs related to increased staffing in this area 
approximately million of the increase in was due to our new zealand operations as production increased over levels 
severance and other taxes increased million  or over levels  while in these taxes increased million  or over levels 
the increases were due primarily to higher commodity prices and increased lake washington and rimu kauri production in each of the periods 
severance taxes on oil in louisiana are of oil sales  which is higher than in the other states where we have production 
as our percentage of oil production in louisiana increases  the overall percentage of severance costs to sales also increases 
severance and other taxes  as a percentage of oil and gas sales  were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized

interest expense on our senior notes due issued in june  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in and million in interest expense on our senior subordinated notes due issued in april  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in both and  and million in interest expense on our senior subordinated notes issued in august and repurchased and retired in  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in and million in interest expense on our bank credit facility  including commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in  million in  and million in other interest cost was million in we capitalize a portion of interest related to unproved properties 
the decrease of interest expense in was primarily due to the lower 
table of contents interest rate applicable to the notes issued in june versus the notes retired at that time 
the increase in interest expense in was due to lower capitalized interest than in in  we incurred million of debt retirement costs related to the repurchase and redemption of our senior subordinated notes due the costs were comprised of approximately million of premiums paid to repurchase the notes  million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs  million to write off unamortized debt discount and approximately million of other costs 
our overall effective tax rate was for  and for and the effective tax rate for  and was lower than the statutory tax rates primarily due to reductions from the new zealand statutory rate attributable to the currency effect on the new zealand deferred tax calculation 
the provision for included the reversal of a new zealand repatriation allowance offset by an adjustment to correct an error in a prior year s tax returns and higher state tax rate estimates 
the effective tax rate for included favorable corrections to tax basis amounts discovered while preparing the prior year s tax returns  partially offset by higher deferred state income taxes 
income tax expense in included higher domestic state income taxes and other items 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations on january  our adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a one time net of taxes charge of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income 
net income 
our net income in of million was higher than our net income of million due to higher commodity prices and increased production 
our net income in of million was higher than our net income of million due to higher commodity prices and increased production 
contractual commitments and obligations our contractual commitments for the next five years and thereafter as of december  are as follows thereafter total in thousands non cancelable operating leases asset retirement obligation construction at the corporate office drilling rigs  seismic and pipe inventory senior notes due senior subordinated notes due credit facility total our most significant office lease is in houston  texas extends until amounts shown by year are the fair values at december  amounts do not include the interest obligation  which is paid semiannually 
the credit facility expires in october and these amounts exclude a million standby letter of credit outstanding under this facility 

table of contents commodity price trends and uncertainties oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile in the future 
the price of oil has increased over the last two years and is at historical highs when compared to longer term historical prices 
factors such as worldwide supply disruptions  worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  fluctuating currency exchange rates  political conditions in major oil producing regions  especially the middle east  can cause fluctuations in the price of oil 
domestic natural gas prices continue to remain high when compared to longer term historical prices 
north american weather conditions  the industrial and consumer demand for natural gas  storage levels of natural gas  and the availability and accessibility of natural gas deposits in north america can cause significant fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
income tax regulations the tax laws in the jurisdictions we operate in are continuously changing and professional judgments regarding such tax laws can differ 
liquidity and capital resources during  we largely relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities of million to fund capital expenditures of million and million of acquisitions 
during  we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities of million  the issuance of our senior notes due  proceeds from the sale of non core properties and equipment of million  less the repayment of our senior subordinated notes due to fund capital expenditures of million and acquisitions of million 
net cash provided by operating activities 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities was million  representing a increase as compared to million generated during the million increase in was primarily due to an increase of million in oil and gas sales  attributable to higher commodity prices and production  offset in part by higher lease operating costs due to higher domestic production and severance taxes as a result of higher commodity prices 
in  net cash provided by operating activities increased by to million  as compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to an increase of million in oil and gas sales  attributable to higher commodity prices and production  offset in part by higher lease operating costs due to higher domestic production and severance taxes as a result of higher commodity prices in accounts receivable 
included in the accounts receivable balance  which totaled million at december   on the accompanying balance sheets  were approximately million of receivables related to hydrocarbon volumes produced from and that had been disputed since early as a result of the dispute  we did not record a receivable with regard to any disputed volumes and our contract governing these sales expired in based on settlement discussions  we settled our claim with this counter party in july by receiving a cash payment for less than our gross receivable 
accordingly  in the second quarter of  we increased our reserve for this claim by approximately million  which is recorded in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statements of income 
we assess the collectibility of accounts receivable  and based on our judgment  we accrue a reserve when we believe a receivable may not be collected 
at december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of less than million and million  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts has been deducted from the total accounts receivable balances on the accompanying balance sheets 
sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
we have incurred substantial costs to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of these expenditures have reduced our net cash provided by operating activities in each of the last three years 
in  and  sarbanes oxley act compliance costs  including internal and external costs  are reflected in general and administrative  net on the accompanying statements of income 
existing credit facility 
we had no borrowings under our bank credit facility at december   and million in outstanding borrowings at december  our bank credit facility at december  consisted of 
table of contents a million revolving line of credit with a million borrowing base 
the borrowing base is re determined at least every six months and was reaffirmed by our bank group at million  effective november  we maintain the commitment amount at million  which amount was set at our request effective may  under the terms of our bank credit facility  we can increase this commitment amount to the total amount of the borrowing base at our discretion  subject to the terms of the credit agreement 
our revolving credit facility includes requirements to maintain certain minimum financial ratios principally pertaining to adjusted working capital ratios and ebitdax  and limitations on incurring other debt 
we are in compliance with the provisions of this agreement 
our access to funds from our credit facility is not restricted under any material adverse condition clause  a clause that is common for credit agreements to include 
a material adverse condition clause can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have an adverse or material effect on our operations  financial condition  prospects or properties  and would impair our ability to make timely debt repayments 
our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report events or conditions having a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 
working capital 
our working capital improved from a deficit of million at december   to a surplus of million at december  the improvement primarily resulted from an increase in cash and cash equivalents and an increase in accounts receivable for oil and gas sales due to higher sales volumes and commodity prices 
repurchase of senior subordinated notes due in june  we repurchased million of our senior subordinated notes due pursuant to a tender offer  and recorded debt retirement costs of million related to this repurchase 
in july  we repurchased approximately million of these notes  and as of august   we redeemed the remaining million of these notes 
we have recorded a total of million in debt retirement costs related to the total repurchase of these notes 
debt maturities 
our credit facility extends until october  our million of senior notes mature july   and our million of senior subordinated notes mature may  capital expenditures 
in we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities of million to fund capital expenditures of million and acquisitions of million 
our total capital expenditures of approximately million in included domestic expenditures of million as follows million for drilling and developmental activity costs  predominantly in our lake washington area  million on property acquisitions  including million to acquire properties in the south bearhead creek field  million on exploratory drilling  mainly in our lake washington area  million of domestic prospect costs  principally prospect leasehold  d seismic activity  and geological costs of unproved prospects  million primarily for a field office building  computer equipment  software  furniture  and fixtures  million on gas processing plants in the brookeland and masters creek areas  and less than million on field compression facilities 
new zealand expenditures of million as follows million for drilling costs and developmental activity costs  predominantly in our rimu kauri area  
table of contents million on exploratory drilling  million on prospect costs  principally prospect leasehold  seismic and geological costs of unproved properties  million on gas processing plants  and million for computer equipment  software  furniture  and fixtures 
we have spent considerable time and capital in and on significant facility capacity upgrades in the lake washington field to increase facility capacity to approximately  barrels per day for crude oil  up from  barrels per day capacity in the first quarter of we have upgraded three production platforms  added new compression for the gas lift system  and installed a new oil delivery system and permanent barge loading facility 
we successfully completed of wells in  for a success rate of 
domestically  we completed of development wells for a success rate of and completed five of nine exploration wells 
a total of wells were drilled in the lake washington area  of which were completed  and wells were drilled in the awp olmos area  all of which were completed 
in new zealand  we completed two of five development wells  and one of five exploratory wells 
our capital expenditure budget is million to million  net of million to million of dispositions and excluding any acquisitions 
approximately of the budget is targeted for domestic activities  with about planned for activities in new zealand 
we plan to spend million to million in our south louisiana region  which includes lake washington  bay de chene and cote blanche island 
of this amount  approximately million to million will be focused in bay de chene and cote blanche island and includes approximately million designated for the cote blanche island d seismic acquisition planned for the million to million of dispositions relate to non core properties planned for later in we expect that our capital expenditures to remain below our cash flows provided from operating activities during  similar to during  we may utilize our free cash flow to expand our capital budget and accelerate our drilling inventory plans to take advantage of current commodity prices  potential acquisitions  debt repayment or stock repurchases 
for  we are targeting an increase of to for total production and an increase of to for proved reserves  over the levels 
our capital expenditures were approximately million in and million in during  we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities of million  the issuance of our senior notes due  proceeds from the sale of non core properties and equipment of million  less the repayment of our senior subordinated notes due to fund capital expenditures of million and acquisitions of million

in  we participated in drilling domestic development wells and ten domestic exploratory wells  of which development wells and four exploratory wells were completed 
in new zealand we drilled development wells  of which ten were completed  and one unsuccessful exploratory well 
new accounting principles eitf addresses when a limited partnership should be consolidated by its general partner 
eitf presumes that a sole general partner in a limited partnership controls the limited partnership  and therefore should consolidate the limited partnership 
the presumption of control can be overcome if the limited partners have a the substantive ability to remove the sole general partner or otherwise dissolve the limited partnership or b substantive participating rights 
the eitf reached a tentative conclusion on the circumstances in which either kick out rights or participating rights would be considered substantive and preclude consolidation by the general partner 
the fasb ratified the eitf consensus at the june eitf meeting 
we do not believe this eitf will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because we believe our limited partners have substantive kick out rights under paragraph b of fin r 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires all employee share based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
sfas no 
discontinues the ability to account for these equity instruments under the intrinsic value method as described in apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
the requirements of sfas no 
r are effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  sfas no 
r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods  we have chosen the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the adoption date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the adoption date 
in april  the sec issued a release announcing that it would provide for a phased in implementation process for sfas no 
r 
as a result  our required date to adopt sfas no 
r was january  also in april  the sec issued staff accounting bulleting no 
 share based payment  which provides guidance on the implementation of sfas no 
r 
sab no 
provides guidance on valuing options  estimating volatility and expected terms of the option awards  and discusses the sec s views on share based payment transactions with non employees  the capitalization of compensation cost and accounting for income tax effects of share based payment arrangements upon adoption of sfas no 
r 

table of contents we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement  the company previously accounted for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method is expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations 
however  it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
we use the black scholes merton formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees and expect to continue to use this acceptable option valuation model after the required adoption of sfas no 
r 
the significance of the impact of adoption will depend on levels of outstanding unvested share based payments on the date of adoption and share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement no 
r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement no 
as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share under stock based compensation 
we are still evaluating the effect of adopting this standard  but do not believe the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle will be material to our results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
requires voluntary changes in accounting principles to be applied retrospectively  unless it is impracticable 
sfas no 
s retrospective application requirement replaces apb s requirement to recognize most voluntary changes in accounting principle by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
if retrospective application for all prior periods is impracticable  the method used to report the change and the reason the retrospective application is impracticable are to be disclosed 
under sfas no 
 retrospective application will be the transition method in the unusual instance that a newly issued accounting pronouncement does not provide specific transition guidance 
it is expected that many pronouncements will specify transition methods other than retrospective 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   and the adoption of this statement is expected to have no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued an exposure draft accounting for uncertain tax positions  a proposed interpretation of fasb statement no 
the proposed interpretation would apply to all open tax positions under fasb no 
the conclusions in this interpretation include initial recognition of tax benefits  recognition and de recognition of tax positions  measurement of tax benefits and classifications of tax liabilities 
the comment period on this exposure draft ended in september  and we are currently assessing the impact  if any  that this interpretation would have on our financial position and results of operations 
the fasb has not issued an effective date for this interpretation  and a final standard will likely be issued in proved oil and gas reserves 
at year end  our total proved reserves were bcfe with a pv value of billion pv is a non gaap measure  see the section titled oil and natural gas reserves in our business and properties section for a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to the closest gaap measure  the standardized measure 
in  our proved natural gas reserves decreased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves decreased mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves decreased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent decrease of bcfe  or 
in  our proved natural gas reserves decreased by bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves increased by mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves decreased by mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent decrease of bcfe  or 
we added reserves over the past three years through both our drilling activity and purchases of minerals in place 
through drilling we added bcfe of which came from new zealand of proved reserves in  bcfe all of which was domestic in  and bcfe bcfe of which came from new zealand in through acquisitions we added bcfe of proved reserves in  bcfe in  and bcfe in at year end  of our total proved reserves were proved developed  compared with at year end and at year end the pv value of our total proved reserves at year end increased from the pv value at year end gas prices increased in to per mcf from per mcf at year end  compared to per mcf at year end oil prices increased in to per bbl from per bbl at year end  
table of contents compared to in under sec guidelines  estimates of proved reserves must be made using year end oil and gas sales prices and are held constant for that year s reserve calculation throughout the life of the properties 
subsequent changes to such year end oil and gas prices could have a significant impact on the calculated pv value 
critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of certain assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
significant estimates underlying these financial statements include the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion of oil and natural gas properties and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows there from  accruals related to oil and gas revenues  capital expenditures and lease operating expenses  estimates of insurance recoveries related to property damage and business interruption claims  the estimated future cost and timing of asset retirement obligations  and estimates made in our income tax calculations 
while we are not aware of any material revisions to any of our estimates  there will likely be future revisions to our estimates resulting from matters such as changes in ownership interests  payouts  joint venture audits  re allocations by purchasers or pipelines  or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and gas industry  many of which require retroactive application 
these types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs 
property and equipment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas property and equipment costs 
under this method of accounting  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration  development  and acquisition of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
such costs may be incurred both prior to and after the acquisition of a property and include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion  and equipment 
internal costs incurred that are directly identified with exploration  development  and acquisition activities undertaken by us for our own account  and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities  are also capitalized 
for the years   and  such internal costs capitalized totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
interest costs are also capitalized to unproved oil and gas properties 
for the years   and  capitalized interest on unproved properties totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
interest not capitalized and general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred 
full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of oil and gas properties including gas processing facilities  capitalized asset retirement obligations  net of related salvage values and deferred income taxes  and excluding the recognized asset retirement obligation liability is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties excluding cash outflows from recognized asset retirement obligations  including future development and abandonment costs of wells to be drilled  using period end prices  adjusted for the effects of hedging  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects ceiling test 
our hedges at december  consisted of natural gas price floors with strike prices lower than the period end price and thus did not materially affect prices used in this calculation 
this calculation is done on a country by country basis 

table of contents the calculation of the ceiling test and provision for dd a is based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimates 
accordingly  reserves estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
our reserves estimates are prepared in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidelines  and  are audited on an annual basis at year end by a firm of independent petroleum engineers in accordance with standards approved by the board of directors of the society of petroleum engineers 
given the volatility of oil and gas prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves could change in the near term 
if oil and gas prices decline from our period end prices used in the ceiling test  even if only for a short period  it is possible that non cash write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
price risk management activities 
the company follows sfas no 
 which requires that changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the statement also establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts is recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
hedge accounting for a qualifying hedge allows the gains and losses on derivatives to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statements and requires that a company formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting  and the ineffective portion of the hedge  are recognized currently in income 
we have a price risk management policy to use derivative instruments to protect against declines in oil and gas prices  mainly through the purchase of price floors and collars 
during  and  we recognized net losses of million  million and million  respectively  relating to our derivative activities 
this activity is recorded in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statements of income 
at december   the company had recorded million  net of taxes of less than million  of derivative losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax on the accompanying balance sheet 
this amount represents the change in fair value for the effective portion of our hedging transactions that qualified as cash flow hedges 
the ineffectiveness reported in price risk management and other  net for   and was not material 
we expect to reclassify all amounts currently held in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax into the statement of income within the next six months when the forecasted sale of hedged production occurs 
at december   we had in place price floors in effect for february through the june contract month for natural gas  that cover a portion of our domestic natural gas production for february to june the natural gas price floors cover notional volumes of  mmbtu  with a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu 
our natural gas price floors in place at december  are expected to cover approximately to of our estimated domestic natural gas production from february to june when we entered into these transactions discussed above  they were designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of natural gas production 
changes in the fair value of a hedge that is highly effective and is designated and documented and qualifies as a cash flow hedge  to the extent that the hedge is effective  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax 
when the hedged transactions are recorded upon the actual sale of oil and natural gas  these gains or losses are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of income tax and recorded in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statement of income 
the fair value of our derivatives is computed using the black scholes option pricing model and is periodically verified against quotes from brokers 
the fair value of these instruments at december   was million and is recognized on the accompanying balance sheet in other current assets

table of contents stock based compensation 
we have three stock based compensation plans  which are described more fully in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we issued restricted stock for the first time in and again in  and recorded expense related to these shares of million and less than million for and  respectively  in general and administrative  net on the accompanying statements of income 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income for employee stock options  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant  or in the case of the employee stock purchase plan  the purchase price is of the lower of the closing price of our common stock as quoted on the new york stock exchange at the beginning or end of the plan year or a date during the year chosen by the participant 
foreign currency 
we use the us dollar as our functional currency in new zealand 
the functional currency is determined by examining the entities cash flows  commodity pricing  environment and financing arrangements 
we have both assets and liabilities denominated in new zealand dollars  the new zealand deferred income taxes and a portion of our asset retirement obligation on the accompanying balance sheet 
for accounts other than deferred income taxes  as the currency rate changes between the us dollar and the new zealand dollar  we recognize transaction gains and losses in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statements of income 
we recognize transaction gains and losses on deferred income taxes in provision for income taxes on the accompanying statement of income 
related party transactions we are the operator of a number of properties owned by affiliated limited partnerships and  accordingly  charge these entities operating fees 
the operating fees charged to the partnerships totaled approximately million in  and  and are recorded as reductions of general and administrative  net 
we also have been reimbursed for administrative  and overhead costs incurred in conducting the business of the limited partnerships  which totaled less than million  million  and million in   and  respectively  and are recorded as reductions in general and administrative  net 
included in accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets  is approximately million and million  respectively  in receivables from and payables to the partnerships at december  we receive research  technical writing  publishing  and website related services from tec com inc  a corporation located in knoxville  tennessee and controlled and majority owned by the sister of the company s chairman of the board and aunt of the company s chief executive officer 
in  and  we paid approximately million per year to tec com for such services pursuant to the terms of the contract between the parties 
the contract was renewed june  on substantially the same terms and expires june  we believe that the terms of this contract are consistent with third party arrangements that provide similar services 
as a matter of corporate governance policy and practice  related party transactions are annually presented and considered by the corporate governance committee of our board of directors in accordance with the committee s charter

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility are expected to continue 
our price risk management policy permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options contracts to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
below is a description of the financial instruments we have utilized to hedge our exposure to price risk 
price floors at december   we had in place price floors in effect through the june contract month for natural gas  these cover a portion of our domestic natural gas production for february to june the natural gas price floors cover notional volumes of  mmbtu  with a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu 
our natural gas price floors in place at december  are expected to cover approximately to of our domestic natural gas production from february to june the fair value of these instruments at december   was million and is recognized on the accompanying balance sheet in other current assets 
there are no additional cash outflows for these price floors  as the cash premium was paid at inception of the hedge 
the maximum loss that could be sustained from these price floors in would be their fair value at december  of million 
new zealand gas contracts all of our gas production in new zealand is sold under long term  fixed price contracts denominated in new zealand dollars 
these contracts protect against price volatility  and our revenue from these contracts will vary only due to production fluctuations and foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
our senior notes and senior subordinated notes both have fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow risk from market interest rate changes on these notes 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  which bears a floating rate of interest and therefore is susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the result of a fluctuation in the bank s base rate would constitute basis points and would not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows based on this same level or a modest level of borrowing 
income tax carryforwards 
we had significant federal and state net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards at december  the company has not recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets attributable to these carryovers at december   as management estimates that it is more likely than not that these assets will be fully utilized before they expire except for a million valuation allowance against the capital loss carryforward  as detailed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
significant changes in estimates caused by changes in oil and gas prices  production levels  capital expenditures  and other variables could impact the company s ability to utilize the carryover amounts 
if we are not able to use our carryforwards  our results of operations and cash flows will be negatively impacted 
financial instruments and debt maturities 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings  and senior notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid or short term nature of these instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
based upon quoted market prices as of december  and  the fair values of our senior subordinated notes due were million  or of face value  and million  or of face value  respectively 
based upon quoted market prices as of december  and  the fair values of our senior notes due were million  or of face value  and million  or of face value 
the carrying value of our senior subordinated notes due was million at december for both and the carrying value of our senior notes due was million at december for both and foreign currency risk 
we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currencies  most notably the new zealand dollar 
fluctuations in rates between the new zealand dollar and us dollar may impact our 
table of contents financial results from our new zealand subsidiaries since we have receivables  liabilities  natural gas and ngl sales contracts  and new zealand income tax calculations  all denominated in new zealand dollars 
we use the us dollar as our functional currency in new zealand and because of this  our results of operations  cash flows and effective tax rate are impacted from fluctuations between the us dollar and the new zealand dollar 
customer credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
our ability to collect on sales to our customers is dependent on the liquidity of our customer base 
to manage customer credit risk  we monitor credit ratings of customers and seek to minimize exposure to any one customer where other customers are readily available 
due to availability of other purchasers  we do not believe the loss of any single oil or gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
