item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
overview we are a leading provider of information technology it and business process outsourcing bpo services to corporate and government clients around the world 
this section provides an overview of the principal factors and events that impacted our results and the principal risks and opportunities that could impact our future 
highlights progress on initiatives at the beginning of  we stated our priorities were to shift our focus from improving our core business and strengthening our balance sheet to a longer term strategy  which contemplated significant new investments in our infrastructure and in new service offerings intended to improve our cost competitiveness and generate future growth 
this discussion outlines our progress on these initiatives 
investments in these initiatives  including our upfront investment in the uk ministry of defence contract referred to below  reduced our earnings by approximately per share during investments in infrastructure 
the principal focus of our investments in infrastructure during the year was the development of our agile enterprise platform  a network based utility architecture designed to create a flexible  open and cost effective technology foundation for the delivery of a significant portion of our it outsourcing and bpo services 
this platform includes the build out of a global secure infrastructure  which is expected to be completed during  as well as the modernization of legacy systems 
as part of this strategy we have established alliance relationships with leading industry providers  which we refer to as the eds agility alliance 
we believe the technology vision behind the agile enterprise platform represents a key market differentiator for eds and contributed to our increased level of new business signings in and year to date in investments in new service offerings 
our investments included a significant expansion of our human resources hr bpo capabilities  principally through the creation in the first quarter of excelleratehro llp  our owned joint venture with towers perrin 
excelleratehro combines our payroll and related hr outsourcing business with the pension  health and welfare administration services business formerly operated by towers perrin as its towers perrin administrative services tpas business 
the new company enables us to offer a comprehensive set of hr outsourcing solutions across the core areas of benefits  payroll  compensation management  workforce administration and relocation  recruitment and staffing  and workforce development 
the million in cash we paid at closing of the transaction which principally represented the purchase price for the business and the right to use the towers perrin brand  net of towers perrin s interest in the new company and its share of the cash capital contribution approximately million to the venture was funded from cash on hand 
we invested additional amounts in excelleratehro and other bpo offerings during the year and will continue to focus on expanding our bpo offerings in cost competitiveness 
we continued to focus on improving our cost competitiveness in as part of our long term goal to reduce our cost of revenue by approximately over the four year period commencing with during  we reduced our cost of revenue by approximately billion principally through the following improvements in our supply chain  including increased usage of centralizing sourcing  competitive bidding  advanced sourcing tools and automation and improvements in demand planning  logistics and fulfillment  labor cost management through increased productivity  investment in automation and monitoring tools  and acceleration of our best shore sm initiatives by increasing our capabilities in lower cost geographies  enterprise process improvements  including greater standardization and consolidation  more regimented contract start up processes and service delivery automation  and production process improvements  including automation and process redesign enabling improved utilization of data center capacity 
in addition  during we sold sixteen domestic and international real estate properties in connection with our efforts to improve our cost competitiveness and enhance workplace capacity usage 
net proceeds from the sale were million 
fourteen properties involved in the sale have been leased back for various extended periods 
a deferred net gain of million has been allocated to various leased properties and will be recognized over the respective term of each lease 
we recognized a net gain of million on the sale of the remaining properties which is included in other income in the consolidated statement of operations 
general motors recompete gm is our largest single client  accounting for approximately billion  or  of our total revenue in our ten year master service agreement  or msa  with gm expires in june the msa serves as a framework for the negotiation and operation of service agreements for certain in scope it services as defined in the msa we provide to gm on a worldwide basis 
these in scope services account for a substantial majority of our revenues from gm 
in february  gm announced the results of a recompete process which covered substantially all of the work we perform under the msa  including applications maintenance  infrastructure operations and integration management 
we were awarded approximately of the contracts we bid on with a total contract value of approximately billion over five years 
see priorities and expectations for and beyond below for a discussion of the financial impact of the gm recompete in and thereafter 
at kearney during  we approved a plan to proceed with a transaction to sell of our ownership interest in our at kearney management consulting business 
that subsidiary  the sale of which was completed on january   is classified as held for sale at december  and and its results for the years ended december   and are included in income loss from discontinued operations 
at kearney s results include a pre tax impairment charge of million to write down the carrying value of its long lived assets  including tradename intangible  to estimated fair value less cost to sell 
the estimated fair value was determined based on the terms of the sale 
the impairment charge is partially offset by the recognition of million previously unrecognized tax assets that will be realized as a result of the sale 
we refer you to notes and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
third party bankruptcies we provide it services to delphi corporation delphi through a long term agreement 
on october   delphi filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
due to uncertainties regarding the recoverability of certain pre bankruptcy receivables associated with the delphi contract  we recorded receivable reserves of million which is reflected in cost of revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
the remaining assets associated with our services agreement with delphi are expected to be recovered through collection or future operations 
during  we recorded write downs of our investment in an aircraft leasing partnership due to uncertainties regarding the recoverability of the partnership s investments in aircraft leased by delta air lines  which filed for bankruptcy on september   and the proposed sale of certain lease investments in the partnership 
these write downs were partially offset by the accelerated recognition of previously deferred investment tax credits associated with the investment 
these write downs totaled million and are reflected in other expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
client contract payment during  we reached an agreement with a government client to consolidate and extend our multiple it services agreements with that client into a single extended agreement 
as a result of this contract realignment  we received a non refundable payment of million from the client in the third quarter of a similar payment will be received from this client in the second quarter of which will be used to fund the incremental capital requirements in necessitated by the service delivery transformational requirements for this new contract 
these payments will be recognized as revenue as we provide services over the five year term of the new contract and resulted from the revision of contract pricing and delivery standards of numerous existing it service contracts prior to their contractual end dates 
accounting change we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  as of january  this statement requires the recognition of compensation expense when an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
this change in accounting resulted in the recognition of compensation expense of million million net of tax in the effect of all share based payments on earnings per share both basic and dilutive would have been and  respectively  during the years ended december  and if we had applied the provisions of sfas r 
the effect of share based payments both basic and dilutive on earnings per share during the year ended december  was 
in addition  effective with our march long term incentive award grant  we significantly limited the use of annual stock option grants and instead provided annual grants of performance vesting restricted stock units performance rsus 
although we continue to use stock options as a component of the long term incentive compensation of our senior executives along with performance rsus  we have completely replaced the use of stock options in favor of performance rsus for all other incentive plan participants 
the vesting of the performance rsus is tied to our performance as measured by operating margin  net asset utilization and organic revenue growth over multiple year periods 
prior to january   we recognized compensation cost associated with stock based awards under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under apb no 
 the difference between the quoted market price as of the date of the grant and the contractual purchase price of shares was charged to operations over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
no compensation cost was recognized for fixed stock options with exercise prices equal to the market price of the stock on the dates of grant and shares acquired by employees under the eds stock purchase plan or nonqualified stock purchase plan 
the primary difference in the accounting under sfas r is that compensation expense for share based awards is now recognized when we obtain employee services 
using the fair value approach required by sfas r  compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
prior to january   pro forma compensation expense using the fair value approach was disclosed in the notes to the financial statements in accordance with sfas beginning january   compensation expense for stock options was recognized using the same methodology used to determine pro forma expense for disclosure purposes under sfas we record a tax benefit related to share based payments  recognizing a deferred tax asset based on an effective tax rate of 
the excess of the market value of our stock over the exercise price at the date of exercise represents the tax deduction to be received 
if this deduction is equal to the amount of compensation expense recorded for that option  the entire tax asset is realized 
if the deduction is greater than the compensation expense recognized  we will record an increase in additional paid in capital 
however  if the deduction is less than the expense recognized  a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  and the deficiency will be reported as deferred tax expense in the period that options expire  are exercised or forfeited 
there are numerous factors that influence the portion of the deferred tax asset that will be realized  including exercise behavior of the employees  future market price of the stock  and the volatility used in calculating the fair value of options on the grant date 
at this time  we cannot predict the actual realization of our deferred tax assets 
nmci we provide end to end it infrastructure on a seat management basis to the department of navy the don  which includes the us navy and marine corps  under a contract that has been extended through september seats are ordered on a governmental fiscal year basis  which runs from october through september amounts to be billed per seat are based on the type of seat ordered 
in addition  certain milestones must be met before we can bill at a price equal to the full seat price included in the pricing schedule 
according to that schedule  seats under management are generally billed at a price of of the associated full seat price until certain service performance levels as defined in the contract are satisfied 
upon meeting such service levels  seats operating under the nmci environment are billed at a price equal to of the full seat price while those operating under the pre existing  or legacy  network environment continue to be billed at a price equal to of the full seat price 
at december   we had approximately  computer seats under management that were then billable  and approximately of these seats were operating under the nmci environment 
long lived assets and lease receivables associated with the contract totaled approximately million and million  respectively  at december  if we do not maintain or exceed current monthly seat cutover rates  or if we do not meet service performance and customer satisfaction levels in accordance with anticipated timelines  estimates of future contract cash flows will decline 
we continue to pursue several opportunities to improve the financial performance of this contract  including efforts to increase the average seat price  qualify for performance and customer satisfaction incentives under the contract  improve productivity  extend the contract term through the don s optional three year extension period  and seek additional business with this client 
we also are seeking to obtain compensation for significant amounts related to services required by and provided to the client in addition to contractual requirements  including services related to legacy applications  and for amounts related to the minimum order obligations under the contract 
in addition  we expect to recover a significant portion of our investment in this contract through the sale of nmci infrastructure and desktop assets to the client at the end of the contract term 
we reported revenues of million  operating losses of million and free cash flow of million associated with the nmci contract in  compared with revenues of million  operating losses of million and free cash flow usage of million in the results are exclusive of the million asset impairment charge taken in the third quarter of and the million repurchase of financial assets from a securitization trust in the fourth quarter of the securitization trust had been used to finance the purchase of capital assets for the contract 
the increase in revenue in compared to is attributable to a greater number of seats under management and recognition of seats billed at of the full seat price  offset in part by a decline in product sales 
the decrease in operating losses in compared to is due to increased productivity  reduced depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the impairment of nmci related long lived assets in the third quarter of  additional seats under management and recognition of seats billed at of the full seat price 
the increase in free cash flow in is due to the aforementioned operational improvements  as well as our repurchase in the fourth quarter of of assets associated with the nmci securitization facility 
see off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations below 
although we continue to have a number of opportunities to improve the performance of the nmci contract over the longer term  we also face a number of significant risks  including the factors that resulted in the impairment of assets in the third quarter of uk ministry of defence in march  a consortium led by us was awarded a ten year contract for the first increment of the uk ministry of defence mod project to consolidate numerous existing information networks into a single next generation infrastructure the defence information infrastructure future project 
the total contract value of this contract was approximately billion over ten years 
billings under the contract are initially based upon the achievement of milestones during the initial development and subsequently on the number of seats deployed 
our upfront expenditure and capital investment requirements for this contract during adversely impacted our free cash flow and earnings for the year 
many of the services and service delivery challenges required by this contract are similar to those required by the nmci contract discussed above  and accordingly  many of the risks are the same 
we have applied lessons learned from our experience with the nmci contract to this contract  including contract terms with clearly defined client and eds accountability and improved program management 
we have met client expectations regarding key deliverables under this contract despite program changes and inability to achieve certain related dependencies that have extended the initial development timeline 
this contract provides for adjustments to reflect the financial impact to eds of client driven program changes and inability to achieve dependencies 
we are working with the client to agree upon the appropriate adjustments provided for under the contract 
if we do not reach satisfactory resolution with respect to these matters or for any future delays in the development timeline or seat deployment schedule our revenues  earnings and free cash flow for this contract  or the timing of the recognition thereof  could be adversely impacted 
settlement of consolidated securities class action on november   we entered into a memorandum of understanding regarding a settlement of the consolidated securities class action filed in late  subject to certain conditions  including final approval of the settlement by the us district court for the eastern district of texas 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the terms of the settlement provide for a cash payment of million 
we estimate approximately one half of such payment will be made by our insurers and have recognized the cost of our portion of the settlement in our financial statements as of december  other on march   we launched excelleratehro llp  our owned joint venture with towers perrin  to deliver a comprehensive range of hr bpo services 
excelleratehro combines eds payroll and related hr outsourcing business with the pension  health and welfare administration services business formerly operated by towers perrin as its tpas business 
the new company enables us to offer a comprehensive set of hr outsourcing solutions across the core areas of benefits  payroll  compensation management  workforce administration and relocation  recruitment and staffing  and workforce development 
the million in cash we paid at closing of the transaction was funded from cash on hand 
this payment principally represented the purchase price for the acquisition by excelleratehro of towers perrin s benefits administration business and the right to use the towers perrin brand name  net of towers perrin s interest in excelleratehro and its share of the cash capital contribution approximately million to the venture 
during  we identified deterioration in the projected performance of one of our commercial contracts based  among other things  on a change in management s judgment regarding the amount and likelihood of achieving anticipated benefits from contract specific productivity initiatives  primarily related to the length of time necessary to achieve cost savings from planned infrastructure optimization initiatives 
we determined that the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the contract over its remaining term were insufficient to recover the contract s deferred contract costs 
as a result  we recognized a non cash impairment charge of million in the second quarter of to write off the contract s deferred contract costs 
the impairment charge is reported as a component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and is included in the results of the outsourcing segment 
remaining long lived assets associated with this contract totaled million at december  the current estimate of cash flows includes cost reductions resulting from the expected optimization of the contract s service delivery infrastructure based on project plans and anticipated vendor rate reductions based on historical and industry trends 
some of the project plans have near term milestones that are critical to meeting overall cost reduction goals 
it is reasonably possible that these milestones may not be met or actual cost savings from these and other planned initiatives may not materialize in the near term and  as a result  remaining long lived assets associated with the contract will become fully impaired 
we continue to pursue several opportunities to improve the financial performance of this contract  including leveraging the infrastructure through the addition of new business opportunities with the client 
priorities and expectations for and beyond we have substantially completed the transformation outlined in to stabilize  fix and invest to grow our business 
our priorities for and beyond are focused on achieving profitable growth through continued focus on cost competitiveness and service quality 
we will continue initiatives to reduce our cost of revenues by approximately billion in following a reduction of approximately billion in each of the past two years 
these initiatives include continued reengineering of our supply chain  labor cost management  enterprise process improvement and production process improvement 
in addition  we will seek to build on our service excellence initiatives  which efforts resulted in increased client loyalty and innovation metrics in we expect revenues of approximately billion  which would represent an increase in organic revenues of from this reflects an anticipated increase in revenues from new business signed during  including the uk mod contract  offset by a decrease in gm revenues discussed above 
we refer you to results of operations below for a definition of organic revenues 
we currently expect earnings per share of approximately  excluding the impact of expensing stock options and performance rsus  and discontinued operations 
such forecasted increase in earnings is due to several factors  including the positive impact of the productivity initiatives described above  improvements in the performance of our nmci and uk mod contracts  revenue growth  and certain extraordinary items that adversely impacted earnings  such as the pension charge related to the termination of our uk inland revenue contract and litigation and settlement expenses 
the incremental impact of such items on our earnings will be partially offset by the second half impact of the expiration of our msa with gm  additional investments in technology and infrastructure  increased sales costs associated with higher levels of new contract signings  and expenses associated with the acceleration of our offshore initiatives 
on february  we announced that the board of directors had authorized a billion share repurchase program over months 
on february  we entered into a million accelerated share repurchase agreement see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
our expectations regarding earnings per share referred to above reflects the impact of the shares acquired through the accelerated share repurchase agreement and other shares that may be repurchased in  which will be somewhat offset by the impact of anticipated issuances of additional shares upon option exercises and other compensation programs 
we expect free cash flow in of million to billion  compared to million in  with the forecasted improvement driven principally by our expected improvements in operating margins and improvements in working capital 
such improvements would be somewhat offset by an increase in net capital expenditures due to the benefit of our sale of real estate assets in gm is our largest single client  accounting for approximately billion  or  of our total revenue in our ten year msa with gm expires in june in february  gm announced the results of a recompete process which covered substantially all of the work we perform under the msa  including applications maintenance  infrastructure operations and integration management 
we were awarded approximately of the contracts we bid on with a total contract value of approximately billion over five years see total contract value of contract signings below 
we expect annualized revenue from gm of approximately billion over the next five years  including the business recently awarded as well as other gm business not part of the recompete 
we expect revenue from gm  which will include the msa through june  will be approximately billion 
we do not expect a significant change in our operating margins attributable to gm revenue compared to we refer you to the discussion in risk factors above of our exposure to certain industries  including the united states automobile industry  that have been experiencing financial difficulties 
such exposure has had  and could in the future have  a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we continue to work with the don with respect to our efforts to improve the performance of our nmci contract and expect that client to extend the contract term through its optional three year extension period  which would run through september  we also expect continued improvement in the operational performance of the contract in  which lost million in  through an increase in average seat prices as well as additional opportunities with this client 
as a result of such operational improvement and anticipated extension of the contract term  we expect this contract  which has used approximately billion of free cash flow since inception  to generate significant free cash flow during and thereafter  including free cash flow generated from the extended contract and through the expected sale of nmci infrastructure and desktop assets to the client at the end of the contract term 
we continue to face a number of risks under this contract  however  as described under highlights above 
see total contract value of contract signings below for a discussion of our expectations for new contract signings for the estimates for financial performance set forth in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations rely on management s current assumptions  including assumptions concerning future events  and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors  many of which are outside the control of management  that could cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
for a discussion of certain of these factors  we refer you to the discussion under risk factors in item a of this form k as well as additional assumptions related to our financial guidance referred to under income taxes below 
total contract value of contract signings a key metric used by management to monitor new business activity is the total contract value  or tcv  of our contract signings 
there are no third party standards or requirements governing the calculation of tcv 
the tcv of a client contract represents our estimate at contract signing of the total revenue expected over the term of that contract 
contract signings include contracts with new clients and renewals  extensions and add on business with existing clients 
tcv does not include potential revenues that could be earned from a client relationship as a result of future expansion of service offerings to that client  nor does it reflect option years under non governmental contracts that are subject to client discretion 
tcv reflects a number of management estimates and judgments regarding the contract  including assumptions regarding demand driven usage  scope of work and client requirements 
in addition  our contracts may be subject to currency fluctuations and  for contracts with the us federal government  annual funding constraints and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity characteristics 
accordingly  the tcv we report should not be considered firm orders or predictive of future operating results 
following is a summary of the tcv of contract signings  excluding contracts signed by our former at kearney and ugs plm solutions subsidiaries  by quarter for the last five years in billions first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter year the tcv of contract signings can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on a number of factors  including the timing of significant new and renewal contracts and the length of those contracts 
our tcv of contract signings increased to billion in compared to billion in  reflecting an increase in average contract size as well as a greater impact from new and add on business compared to the significant decrease in and compared to the prior years has negatively impacted our revenues since  as a significant portion of our revenue is generated by long term it services contracts 
our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will be dependent on our ability to increase the tcv of contract signings to a level higher than that of recent years 
we expect tcv of contract signings in to be in excess of billion 
we refer you to the discussion of revenues in results of operations below 
results of operations revenues 
following is a summary of revenues from contracts with base non gm clients and revenues from gm  excluding revenues from our former at kearney and ugs plm solutions subsidiaries which are reported as discontinued operations  for the years ended december   and in millions revenues base gm total following is a summary of our revenue growth percentages calculated using revenues reported in the consolidated statements of operations  and adjusted for the impact of foreign currency translation  acquisitions and those divestitures not accounted for as discontinued operations organic revenue growth total base gm as reported revenue growth impact of foreign currency changes fixed us dollar revenue growth impact of acquisitions impact of divestitures organic revenue growth fixed us dollar revenue growth is calculated by removing from as reported revenues the impact of the change in exchange rates between the local currency and the us dollar from the current period and the comparable prior period 
organic revenue growth further excludes revenue growth due to acquisitions in the period presented if the comparable prior period had no revenues from the same acquisition  and revenue decreases due to businesses divested in the period presented or the comparable prior period 
vs 
the decrease in base organic revenues in was primarily attributable to a million  or  decrease in our outsourcing segment which excludes the results of our nmci contract 
the decrease in our outsourcing segment was attributable to a million  or  decrease in the americas unit  a million  or  decrease in europe  middle east and africa emea  and a million  or  decrease in the us government unit  offset by a million  or  increase in asia pacific 
the decrease in revenues in emea was primarily due to the termination of our contract with the uk government s inland revenue department effective june   offset by an increase in revenue from other government and commercial clients  including our contract with the uk ministry of defence 
the decrease in the americas was primarily due to the termination of our other commercial contract effective august  see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in us government was primarily attributable to the completion of a large federal contract in early vs 
the decrease in base organic revenues in was primarily attributable to a million  or  decrease in our outsourcing segment and a million  or  decrease in our nmci segment 
the decrease in the outsourcing segment was attributable to a million  or  decrease in emea and a million  or  decrease in the us government unit  offset by a million  or  increase in the americas and a million  or  increase in asia pacific 
the decrease in revenues in the nmci segment was associated with lower product sales which were partially offset by increased service revenue 
the decrease in base organic revenues in emea in was primarily due to the termination of our contract with the uk government s inland revenue department effective june   and was offset by an increase in revenues from financial services and other government clients 
the us government business experienced reduced revenues in due to runoff from our state and local business  including the termination of the medicaid contract with the state of texas early in the first quarter of the decrease in revenues from our state and local business was offset by an increase in revenues from us federal government contracts 
the decrease in organic revenues from gm in and was primarily attributable to reduced pricing under our msa with gm  which expires in june  as well as gm s move toward a multi vendor strategy 
we expect revenues from gm of approximately billion in and annualized revenues of approximately to billion beginning in we refer you to overview above for a discussion of the recent gm recompete 
gross margin

our gross margins in all periods were adversely affected by the performance of the nmci contract  including asset write downs in and the nmci contract had a basis point  basis point and basis point negative impact on our gross margin percentages in  and  respectively 
other items affecting our gross margin include a pension obligation settlement loss associated with the termination of the inland revenue contract basis points  an increase in compensation expense attributable to the change in accounting for share based payments basis points  a deferred cost impairment charge associated with a large it commercial contract basis points and litigation costs basis points 
these items were partially offset by favorable resolution of certain customer contract matters that permitted recognition of previously deferred revenue basis points

an additional item affecting our gross margin was operating losses and other charges on our other commercial contract basis points 
other items affecting our gross margin include operating losses on our other commercial contract basis points and a million basis point reversal of mci receivable reserves

sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in our sg a percentage in was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense resulting from the change in accounting for share based payments  and performance based rsus basis points and incremental legal and regulatory costs basis points 
our sg a expense in was also impacted by higher sales and marketing costs  including commissions associated with increasing tcv of new business signings basis points  and by certain investment initiatives discussed in highlights above basis points

other income expense 
other income expense includes interest expense  interest and dividend income  investment gains and losses  minority interest expense  and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
following is a summary of other income expense for the years ended december   and in millions other income expense interest expense interest income and other  net total the decrease in interest expense in was primarily due to the extinguishment of debt resulting from our debt exchange offer completed in and other scheduled debt repayments 
see financial position and liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion of our outstanding debt balance 
interest expense in includes million in expenses resulting from our debt exchange offer 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the exchange offer 
the increase in interest income and other in was primarily due to interest income on increased levels of cash and marketable securities  and foreign currency transaction gains 
interest income and other in includes net investment losses of million  including a write down of million relating to our leveraged lease investments  and interest and other income of million 
interest income and other in includes net investment losses of million  including a write down of million relating to our leveraged lease investments  and interest and other income of million 
interest income and other in includes net investment gains of million and other income of million 
income taxes 
our effective tax rates on income loss from continuing operations were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the tax rate in was significantly impacted by i recognition of additional valuation allowances of million for losses incurred in certain foreign tax jurisdictions due to underperforming operations  and ii reversal of certain tax contingency accruals of million due to progress made in jurisdictional tax audits 
our effective tax rate will fluctuate also in the future as a result of our adoption of sfas r as discussed in overview above 
as we record expense under sfas r  a deferred tax asset is recorded 
the realization of that asset is dependent upon the intrinsic value of an option on the date of exercise 
any unrealized deferred tax asset is charged to tax expense in the period of exercise or expiration and  accordingly  would result in a higher effective tax rate in such period 
see application of critical accounting policies below for a discussion of factors affecting income tax expense 
the us research and development tax credit expired as of december  a retroactive extension of the credit is contained in legislation that has been passed by both the house and senate and is currently in reconciliation conference 
the company has determined its guidance on the basis that the credit will be extended with retroactive effect to january  in the event that the legislation is not passed in its current form  full year guidance could be impacted and in the event the legislation is not passed and signed by the president by march   quarterly results could be adversely impacted until the extension of the credit is signed and can be reflected in the full year effective tax rate 
on october   the president of the united states signed the american jobs creation act of the act created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
management determined that the incremental cost of the repatriation did not produce a corresponding economic benefit  and as a result  we did not make a repatriation under this provision 
discontinued operations 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  was million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and income loss from discontinued operations is comprised primarily of the net results of at kearney which is classified as held for sale at december   and ugs plm solutions which was sold during the second quarter of discontinued operations also includes our european technology solutions and subscription fulfillment businesses sold during income from discontinued operations includes net gains losses of million  million and million  net of income taxes  in  and  respectively 
net income loss

 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  on a cumulative basis as of january  the adoption of eitf resulted in a non cash adjustment of billion  net of tax  resulting primarily from the reversal of unbilled revenue associated with our it service contracts which we had been accounting for using the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition 
the adjustment also reflects the deferral and subsequent amortization of system construction costs which were previously expensed as incurred and included in the percentage of completion model for the respective contracts 
in addition  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective january  sfas no 
requires that the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the majority of our retirement obligations relate to leases which require the facilities be restored to original condition at the expiration of the leases 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a reduction of income reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million after tax 
additionally  the fair value of the liability recorded on january  was million 
segment information 
we refer you to note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of certain financial information related to our reportable segments for  and  as well as certain financial information related to our operations by geographic region and by service line for such years 
financial position at december   we held cash and marketable securities of billion  had working capital of billion  and had a current ratio current assets current liabilities of to this compares to cash and marketable securities of billion  working capital of billion  and a current ratio of to at december  approximately of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  were not available for debt repayment due to various commercial limitations on the use of these assets 
the decrease in cash and marketable securities in is due principally to cash payments of million associated with the purchase of towers perrin s benefits administration business in the first quarter of  million associated with the purchase of the outstanding interest in our australian subsidiary in the second quarter of and debt payments of million in  offset by free cash flow of million see liquidity and capital resources below for the definition of free cash flow 
days sales outstanding for trade receivables were days at december  compared to days at december  days payable outstanding were days at december  and total debt was billion at december  versus billion at december  total debt consists of notes payable and capital leases 
the total debt to capital ratio which includes total debt and minority interests as components of capital was at december  compared to at december  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations in connection with certain service contracts  we may arrange a client supported financing transaction csft with our client and an independent third party financial institution or its designee 
the use of these transactions enables us to offer clients more favorable financing terms 
these transactions also enable the preservation of our capital and allow us to avoid client credit risk relating to the repayment of the financed amounts 
under these transactions  the independent third party financial institution finances the purchase of certain it related assets and simultaneously leases those assets for use in connection with the service contract 
the use of a csft on a service contract results in lower contract revenue and expense to eds over the contract term 
in csfts  client payments are made directly to the financial institution providing the financing 
if the client does not make the required payments under the service contract  under no circumstances do we have an ultimate obligation to acquire the underlying assets unless our nonperformance under the service contract would permit its termination  or we fail to comply with certain customary terms under the financing agreements  including  for example  covenants we have undertaken regarding the use of the assets for their intended purpose 
we consider the possibility of our failure to comply with any of these terms to be remote 
at december   the estimated future asset purchases to be financed under existing arrangements were million 
the aggregate dollar values of assets purchased under our csft arrangements were million  million and million during  and  respectively 
as of december   there were outstanding an aggregate of million under csfts yet to be paid by our clients 
in the event a client contract is terminated due to nonperformance  we would be required to acquire only those assets associated with the outstanding amounts for that contract 
net of repayments  the estimated future maximum amount outstanding under existing financing arrangements is not expected to exceed million 
we believe we have sufficient alternative sources of capital to directly finance the purchase of capital assets to be used for our current and future client contracts without the use of these arrangements 
during  we established a securitization facility under which we financed the purchase of capital assets for our nmci contract 
under the terms of the facility  we sold certain financial assets resulting from that contract to a trust trust classified as a qualifying special purpose entity for accounting purposes 
during  we completed agreements with the trust s lenders to repurchase financial assets for million in cash 
upon completion of the transaction  we recognized current lease receivables of million and non current lease receivables of million associated with this purchase 
such receivables are being collected over the remaining term of the nmci contract 
performance guarantees 
in the normal course of business  we may provide certain clients  principally governmental entities  with financial performance guarantees  which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds 
in general  we would be liable for the amounts of these guarantees in the event our nonperformance permits termination of the related contract by our client  the likelihood of which we believe is remote 
we believe we are in compliance with our performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee 
following is a summary of the estimated expiration of financial guarantees outstanding as of december  in millions estimated expiration per period total thereafter performance guarantees csft transactions standby letters of credit  surety bonds and other other guarantees total contractual obligations 
following is a summary of payments due in specified periods related to our contractual obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period total after long term debt  including current portion and interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations total amounts represent the expected cash payments principal and interest of our long term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments or bond premiums or discounts 
amounts also include capital lease payments principal and interest 
purchase obligations include material agreements to purchase goods or services  principally software and telecommunications services  that are enforceable and legally binding on eds and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
purchase obligations also exclude our obligation to repurchase minority interests in joint ventures  including our obligation to repurchase towers perrin s minority interest in excelleratehro

liquidity and capital resources following is a summary of our cash flows for the years ended december   and in millions cash flows net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities free cash flow operating activities 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was due to a million increase in earnings  adjusted to exclude non cash operating items  offset by a million change in operating assets and liabilities 
the change in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from a decrease in receivables collections and an increase in tax payments  offset by an increase in deferred revenue see client contract payment in the overview section above 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in compared to was due to a million decrease in earnings  adjusted to exclude non cash operating items  offset by a million change in operating assets and liabilities 
the change in operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from a decrease in prepayments to vendors  a decrease in construction costs related to our active construct contracts and a reduction in tax payments  offset by restructuring payments  a decrease in accounts receivable collections and a one time pension payment of million associated with the termination of the inland revenue contract 
operating cash flows in were comprised of  million in cash provided by our core it outsourcing and consulting businesses excluding nmci  and million in cash provided by our nmci contract 
operating cash flows in were comprised of  million in cash provided by our core it outsourcing and consulting businesses offset by million in cash used by our nmci contract 
investing activities 
the change in net cash used in investing activities in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from divestitures in  and an increase in acquisition payments related to acquisitions see notes  and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we realized net proceeds of million in resulting from sales of real estate see real estate initiatives in the overview section above 
net cash used in investing activities in includes the proceeds from the divestitures of our us wireless clearing business  ugs plm solutions and arg 
divestiture proceeds were somewhat offset by net purchases of marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities in also includes a million cash payment related to the purchase of financial assets associated with the nmci securitization facility 
excluding this purchase  net proceeds from investments and other assets decreased in compared to due primarily to lower securitization proceeds and equipment purchases associated with the nmci contract 
financing activities 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities in compared to was primarily due to proceeds from our common stock issuance associated with a debt exchange in the increase in net cash used in financing activities in was primarily due to an increase in net payments on long term debt and capital lease obligations  partially offset by proceeds from our common stock issuance associated with a debt exchange and by a reduction in dividend payments 
free cash flow 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities  less capital expenditures 
capital expenditures is the sum of i net cash used in investing activities  excluding proceeds from sales of marketable securities  proceeds related to divested assets and non marketable equity investments  payments related to acquisitions  net of cash acquired  and non marketable equity investments  and payments for purchases of marketable securities  and ii capital lease payments 
during  we sold our ugs plm solutions subsidiary and repurchased financial assets outstanding under the nmci contract securitization facility 
due to the significance of these transactions  the calculation of free cash flow for was adjusted to exclude million in transaction fees paid during related to the ugs plm solutions disposition  and the million cash payment related to the repurchase of financial assets associated with the nmci securitization facility 
the calculation of free cash flow for was also adjusted to include million in cash generated through utilization of operating tax credits  predominantly related to  to offset income tax associated with the ugs plm solutions disposition such tax credits would otherwise have been available to offset future taxable income generated by operations 
free cash flow is a non gaap measure and should be viewed together with our consolidated statements of cash flows 
following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the net change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december   and in millions net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures proceeds from investments and other assets net proceeds from real estate sales payments for purchases of property and equipment payments for investments and other assets payments for purchases of software and other intangibles other investing activities capital lease payments total capital expenditures adjustments utilization of tax credits related to the ugs plm solutions disposition transaction fees related to the ugs plm solutions disposition payment related to the repurchase of financial assets associated with the nmci securitization facility free cash flow other investing and financing activities proceeds from sales of marketable securities net proceeds from divested assets and non marketable equity securities payments for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  and non marketable equity securities payments for purchases of marketable securities proceeds from long term debt payments on long term debt net decrease in borrowings with original maturities less than days proceeds from issuance of common stock employee stock transactions dividends paid other financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents adjustments utilization of tax credits transaction fees payment related to the repurchase of financial assets associated with the nmci securitization facility net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents our gross capital requirement in was approximately billion including equipment and real estate leases and the use of csfts

credit facilities 
during  we entered into a million three and one half year multi currency revolving credit agreement with a bank group including citibank  na  as administrative agent  and bank of america  na  as syndication agent 
the new facility replaced our five year million revolving credit facility  which expired in september the new facility may be used for general corporate borrowing purposes and the issuance of letters of credit 
the aggregate availability under the new facility  together with our million three year multi currency revolving credit agreement entered into in  is billion 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under either of these facilities and we had issued letters of credit totaling million under the million three and one half year multi currency revolving credit agreement  thereby reducing the availability under these facilities to million at such date 
the new facility includes financial and other covenants of the general nature contained in the facility it replaced and the million three and one half year multi currency revolving credit facility was amended and restated to include financial and other terms similar to the new facility 
our unsecured credit facilities contain certain financial and other restrictive covenants and representations and warranties that would allow any amounts outstanding under the facilities to be accelerated  or restrict our ability to borrow thereunder  in the event of noncompliance 
the financial covenants of our unsecured credit facilities were modified in september in connection with the replacement of our million credit facility as discussed above  and include a minimum net worth covenant  a fixed charge coverage requirement and a leverage ratio requirement 
the leverage ratio cannot exceed to through december  and to thereafter 
the fixed charge coverage covenant requires us to maintain a fixed charge ratio of no less than to through december  and to thereafter 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  following is a summary of the financial covenant requirements under our unsecured credit facilities and the calculated amount or ratios at december  dollars in millions as of and for the year ended december  covenant actual minimum net worth leverage ratio fixed charge coverage ratio credit ratings 
following is a summary of our senior long term debt credit ratings by moody s investor services  inc moody s  standard poor s rating services s p and fitch ratings fitch at december  moody s s p fitch senior long term debt ba bbb bbb outlook stable negative stable on september   moody s revised our rating outlook to stable from negative 
on november   fitch revised our rating outlook to stable from negative 
at december   we had no recognized or contingent material liabilities that would be subject to accelerated payment due to a ratings downgrade 
we do not believe a negative change in our credit rating would have a material adverse impact on us under the terms of our existing client agreements 
liquidity 
at december   we had total liquidity of billion  comprised of unrestricted cash and marketable securities of billion and availability under our unsecured credit facilities of million 
during  we terminated our secured a r facility  a revolving secured financing arrangement collateralized by certain trade receivables with availability of up to million 
we elected to terminate the facility in order to more closely align our liquidity with our minimum targeted levels referred to below 
we have maintained in effect our unsecured credit agreements which provide for aggregate availability of billion for issuances of letters of credit and general corporate borrowing 
based on our improved free cash flow performance in and forecasted free cash flow improvements  we have moved our minimum targeted liquidity from months of forecasted capital expenditures as defined under free cash flow above  interest payments  debt maturities and dividend payments to months of forecasted capital expenditures  interest payments  debt maturities and dividend payments 
accordingly  in february our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to billion of our common shares in open market or other purchases over the next months 
we completed million of such authorized repurchase through an accelerated share repurchase arrangement in february see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
change in dividend rate 
on july   our board of directors reduced the quarterly dividend on our common stock from to per share 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
areas in which significant judgments and estimates are used include  but are not limited to  revenue recognition  accounts receivable collectibility  accounting for long lived assets  deferred income taxes  retirement plans  performance guarantees and litigation 
revenue recognition and associated cost deferral 
we provide it and business process outsourcing services under time and material  unit price and fixed price contracts  which may extend up to or more years 
services provided over the term of these arrangements may include one or more of the following it infrastructure support and management  it system and software maintenance  application hosting  the design  development  or construction of software and systems construct service  transaction processing  and business process management 
if a contract involves the provision of a single element  revenue is generally recognized when the product or service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent upon any future event 
if the service is provided evenly during the contract term but service billings are irregular  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
however  if the single service is a construct service  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method using a zero profit methodology 
under this method  costs are deferred until contractual milestones are met  at which time the milestone billing is recognized as revenue and an amount of deferred costs is recognized as expense so that cumulative profit equals zero 
if the milestone billing exceeds deferred costs  then the excess is recorded as deferred revenue 
when the construct service is completed and the final milestone met  all unrecognized costs  milestone billings and profit are recognized in full 
if the contract does not contain contractual milestones  costs are expensed as incurred and revenue is recognized in an amount equal to costs incurred until completion of the construct service  at which time any profit would be recognized in full 
if total costs are estimated to exceed revenue for the construct service  then a provision for the estimated loss is made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
if a contract involves the provision of multiple service elements  total estimated contract revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
the amount of revenue allocated to each element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another element in the future 
revenue is then recognized for each element as described above for single element contracts  except revenue recognized on a straight line basis for a non construct service will not exceed amounts currently billable unless the excess revenue is recoverable from the client upon any contract termination event 
if the amount of revenue allocated to a construct service is less than its relative fair value  costs to deliver such service equal to the difference between allocated revenue and the relative fair value are deferred and amortized over the contract term 
if total construct service costs are estimated to exceed the relative fair value for the construct service contained in a multiple element arrangement  then a provision for the estimated loss is made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
in the rare event that fair value is not determinable for each service element of a multiple element contract  the contract is considered one accounting unit  and revenue is recognized using the proportional performance method 
under this method  contract revenue is recognized for each service element based on the proportional performance of each service element to the total expected performance of each service element over the life of the contract 
we also defer and subsequently amortize certain set up costs related to activities that enable the provision of contracted services to the client 
such activities include the relocation of transitioned employees  the migration of client systems or processes  and the exit of client facilities 
deferred contract costs  including set up costs  are amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining original contract term unless billing patterns indicate a more accelerated method is appropriate 
the recoverability of deferred contract costs associated with a particular contract is analyzed whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable using the undiscounted estimated cash flows of the whole contract over its remaining contract term 
if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the long lived assets and deferred contract costs  including contract concessions paid to the client  the deferred contract costs and contract concessions are written down by the amount of the cash flow deficiency 
if a cash flow deficiency remains after reducing the balance of the deferred contract costs and contract concessions to zero  any remaining long lived assets are evaluated for impairment 
any such impairment recognized would equal the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
accounts receivable 
reserves for uncollectible trade receivables are established when collection of amounts due from clients is deemed improbable 
indicators of improbable collection include client bankruptcy  client litigation  industry downturns  client cash flow difficulties or ongoing service or billing disputes 
receivables more than days past due are automatically reserved unless persuasive evidence of probable collection exists 
our allowances for doubtful accounts as a percentage of total gross trade receivables were  and at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the allowance in resulted primarily from the recognition of reserves in connection with the us airways bankruptcy 
excluding those reserves  the allowance percentage was at december  long lived assets 
our property and equipment  software and definite lived intangible asset policies require the amortization or depreciation of assets over their estimated useful lives 
an asset s useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows 
the useful lives of property and equipment are limited to the standard depreciable lives or  for certain assets dedicated to client contracts  the related contract term 
the useful lives of capitalized software are limited to the shorter of the license period or the related contract term 
the estimated useful lives of definite lived intangible assets are based on the expected use of the asset and factors that may limit the use of the asset 
we may utilize the assistance of a third party appraiser in the assessment of the useful life of an intangible asset 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is the amount at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
we conducted an annual goodwill impairment test as of december  the goodwill impairment test requires us to identify our reporting units and obtain estimates of the fair values of those units as of the testing date 
our reporting units are comprised of the geographic components of our operating segments that share similar economic characteristics 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenues  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
we utilize our weighted average cost of capital to discount the estimated expected future cash flows of each unit 
the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value in indicating the underlying goodwill of each unit was not impaired 
we plan to conduct our annual impairment test as of december st of each year when our budgets and operating plans for the forthcoming year are expected to be finalized 
the timing and frequency of additional goodwill impairment tests are based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we will continue to monitor our goodwill balance for impairment and conduct formal tests when impairment indicators are present 
a decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units below its carrying value is an indicator that the underlying goodwill of the unit is potentially impaired 
this situation would require the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine whether the unit s goodwill is impaired 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is required for the amount which the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill would become the new cost basis of the unit s goodwill 
deferred income taxes 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly 
factors considered in making this determination include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located 
valuation allowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
a majority of the tax assets are associated with tax jurisdictions in which we have a large scale of operations and long history of generating taxable income  thereby reducing the estimation risk associated with recoverability analysis 
however  in smaller tax jurisdictions in which we have less historical experience or smaller scale of operations  the assessment of recoverability of tax assets is largely based on projections of taxable income over the expiration period of the tax asset and is subject to greater estimation risk 
accordingly  it is reasonably possible the recoverability of tax assets in these smaller jurisdictions could be impaired as a result of poor operating performance over extended periods of time or a future decision to reduce or eliminate operating activity in such jurisdictions 
such an impairment would result in an increase in our effective tax rate and related tax expense in the period of impairment 
liabilities for tax contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for tax contingencies related to positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the uncertainties in application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due 
our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences  judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions 
although we believe our reserves for tax contingencies are reasonable  they may change in the future due to new developments with each issue 
we record an additional charge or benefit in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is more or less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
retirement plans 
we offer pension and other postretirement benefits to our employees through multiple global pension plans 
our largest pension plans are funded through our cash contributions and earnings on plan assets 
we use the actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  to account for our pension plans 
two of the most significant actuarial assumptions used to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined pension benefit plans are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate assumptions 
sfas no 
requires the use of an expected long term rate of return that  over time  will approximate the actual long term returns earned on pension plan assets 
we base this assumption on historical actual returns as well as anticipated future returns based on our investment mix 
given our relatively young workforce  we are able to take a long term view of our pension investment strategy 
accordingly  plan assets are weighted heavily towards equity investments 
equity investments are susceptible to significant short term fluctuations but have historically outperformed most other investment alternatives on a long term basis 
at december   of pension assets were invested in public and private equity and real estate investments with the remaining assets being invested in fixed income securities 
such mix is consistent with that assumed in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
rebalancing our actual asset allocations to our planned allocations based on actual performance has not been a significant issue 
an weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption was used for the pension plan actuarial valuations in and a basis point increase or decrease in this assumption results in an estimated pension expense decrease or increase  respectively  of million in the subsequent year s pension expense based on the most recent pension valuation and assuming all other variables are constant 
an assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation 
this rate reflects the underlying rate determined on the measurement date at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
high quality bond yields on our measurement date  october   with maturities consistent with expected pension payment periods are used to determine the appropriate discount rate assumption 
for the countries with the largest pension plans  actual participant data is used by our actuaries to determine the maturity of the benefit obligation which is matched to bonds available at the measurement date 
in other countries  we use the average age of the participants to determine the maturity of the benefit obligation 
a weighted average discount rate assumption was used for the pension plan actuarial valuations 
the methodology used to determine the appropriate discount rate assumption has been consistently applied 
a basis point increase in the discount rate assumption will result in an estimated decrease of approximately million in the subsequent year s pension expense  and a basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption will result in an estimated increase of approximately million in the subsequent year s pension expense based on the most recent pension valuation and assuming all other variables are constant 
our long standing policy of making consistent cash pension plan contributions provided some protection against negative short term market returns 
in addition  positive investment returns from to resulted in our actual pension plan asset returns exceeding expected returns reflected in our assumptions 
however  the impact of contributions and positive returns has been offset by declining discount rates over the last several years 
our pension plans funded status  as of october  reflected total plan assets of billion and total accumulated benefit obligations under all plans of billion 
as a result  under the requirements of sfas no 
 we have an additional minimum pension plan liability of million at december  with a corresponding reduction  net of tax  in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of shareholders equity of million 
such liability is slightly higher than the liability at december  our weighted average long term rate of return assumption for plan assets as of january  is 
our net periodic pension cost is expected to decrease from after excluding the impact in of the million settlement loss related to the inland revenue contract discussed in results of operations above 
our required minimum amount of contributions will not exceed actual contributions made in stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes merton pricing model 
the outstanding term of an option is estimated based on the vesting term and contractual term of the option  as well as expected exercise behavior of the employee who receives the option 
expected volatility during the estimated outstanding term of the option is based on historical volatility during a period equivalent to the estimated outstanding term of the option 
expected dividends during the estimated outstanding term of the option are based on recent dividend activity 
risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant 
we estimate the fair value of restricted stock units based on the market value of our stock on the date of grant  adjusted for any restrictive provisions affecting fair value  such as required holding periods after the date of vesting 
compensation expense for share based payment is charged to operations over the vesting period of the award  and includes an estimate for the number of awards expected to vest 
the initial estimate is based on historical results  and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results 
if vesting of such an award is conditioned upon the achievement of performance goals  compensation expense during the performance period is estimated using the most probable outcome of the performance goals  and adjusted as the expected outcome changes 
other liabilities 
in the normal course of business  we may provide certain clients  principally governmental entities  with financial performance guarantees  which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds 
in general  we would only be liable for the amounts of these guarantees in the event that our nonperformance permits termination of the related contract by our client  the likelihood of which we believe is remote 
at december   we had million of outstanding standby letters of credit and surety bonds relating to these performance guarantees 
in addition  we had million outstanding under csft and securitization transactions that are supported by performance guarantees 
we believe we are in compliance with our performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee 
in addition  we had million of other financial guarantees outstanding at december  relating to indebtedness of others 
there are various claims and pending actions against eds arising in the ordinary course of our business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current litigation 
certain of these actions seek damages in significant amounts 
in determining whether a loss accrual or disclosure in our consolidated financial statements is required  we consider  among other things  the degree to which we can make a reasonable estimate of the loss  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome  and the applicability of insurance coverage for a loss 
the degree of probability and the loss related to a particular claim are typically estimated with the assistance of legal counsel 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into various hedging transactions to manage this risk 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments  are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is managed through our debt portfolio of fixed and variable rate instruments including interest rate swaps 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in short term market interest rates 
if these rates average more in than in  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had short term market interest rates averaged more than in  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
equity price sensitivity 
our financial position is affected by changes in equity prices as a result of certain investments 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in the value of our equity security investments 
if the market price of our investments in equity securities in were to fall by below the level at the end of  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  declines in the market price of our equity securities did not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
foreign exchange risk 
we conduct business in the united states and around the world 
our most significant foreign currency transaction exposures relate to canada  mexico  the united kingdom  western european countries that use the euro as a common currency  australia and new zealand 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against foreign currency exchange risk from intercompany financing and trading transactions 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts and currency options with durations of generally less than days to hedge such transactions 
we have not entered into foreign currency forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
generally  foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized immediately in earnings 
in addition  since we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge  any change in currency rates would not result in any material gain or loss  as any gain or loss on the underlying foreign denominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates average more in than in  there would be no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
during  had foreign currency rates averaged more than in  there would have been no material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position 
accelerated stock repurchase 
pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase agreement entered into in february  we are subject to equity price risk due to the repurchase of common stock through that program see part ii  item 
at the end of the program  we are required to receive or pay a price adjustment based on the difference between the average price paid by credit suisse for our stock over the life of the program and the initial purchase price of per share for million shares 
at our election  any payments we are required to make pursuant to the settlement of the forward contract could either be in cash or in shares of our common stock 
changes in the fair value of our common stock will impact the final settlement of the program 
settlement is expected to occur in the second quarter of  depending upon the timing and pace of purchases
