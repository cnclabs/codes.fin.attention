item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview boston scientific corporation is a worldwide developer  manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties including interventional cardiology  peripheral interventions  vascular surgery  electrophysiology  neurovascular intervention  oncology  endoscopy  urology  gynecology and neuromodulation 
our mission is to improve the quality of patient care and the productivity of healthcare delivery through the development and advocacy of less invasive medical devices and procedures 
this mission is accomplished through the continuing refinement of existing products and procedures and the investigation and development of new technologies that can reduce risk  trauma  cost  procedure time and the need for aftercare 
our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances 
our management s discussion and analysis md a begins with an executive summary that outlines our financial highlights during and focuses on the impact of drug eluting stents to our operations 
in addition  our executive summary will discuss the significance of the proposed guidant corporation acquisition to our future growth 
following the executive summary is an examination of the material changes in our operating results for as compared to and our operating results for as compared to the operating results are supplemented by an in depth look at the major issues we believe are most relevant to our current and future prospects  including the proposed acquisition of guidant 
the discussion then provides an examination of liquidity  focusing primarily on material changes in our operating  investing and financing cash flows  as depicted in our statements of cash flows  and the trends underlying these changes 
in addition  we will highlight the impact of the potential guidant acquisition on our future liquidity 
finally  the md a provides information on our critical accounting policies 
executive summary our net sales in increased to  million from  million in  an increase of percent 
excluding the favorable impact of million of foreign currency fluctuations  our net sales increased percent 
our gross profit increased to  million  or percent of net sales  in from  million  or percent of net sales  in our reported net income for was million  or per diluted share  as compared to  million  or per diluted share  in our reported results included net after tax charges of million  or per diluted share  in as compared to net after tax charges of million  or per diluted share  in in addition  our cash provided by operating activities was million in  which includes million paid for the medinol settlement  as compared to  million in the growth in resulted largely from a full year of sales of our taxus express paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system that we launched in the united states in march and increased sales of the taxus stent system in our europe and inter continental markets 
taxus stent sales in were  million as compared  million in  an increase of percent 
we have achieved and maintained leading drug eluting stent market positions within our us  europe the net after tax charges consisted of a million litigation settlement with medinol ltd  million in purchased research and development primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions  million of asset write downs and employee related costs that resulted from certain business optimization initiatives  million in expenses related to certain retirement benefits  and a million tax adjustment associated with a technical correction made to the american jobs creation act 
the net after tax charges consisted of a million provision for legal and regulatory exposures  a million enhancement to our k retirement savings plan  million of purchased research and development  a million charge relating to taxes on the approximately billion of cash that we repatriated in under the american jobs creation act of  and a million non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans 
and inter continental markets 
further  due to increased penetration rates and the successful launch of our next generation taxus libert paclitaxel eluting coronary stent system in our europe and inter continental markets  our international taxus stent system sales for increased by percent as compared to this increase in sales was offset by decreased taxus stent system sales in the us during the second half of  as compared to the same period in the prior year largely due to a reduction in market share  as well as pricing pressure 
during the first three quarters of  we experienced sequential declines in our market share 
in the fourth quarter of  our market share stabilized and was relatively consistent with the prior quarter 
we expect to launch our taxus libert stent system in the us in the second half of and our taxus express stent system in japan in the first half of  subject to regulatory approvals 
in addition  during  our worldwide endosurgery group sales increased to  million from  million in  an increase of percent 
further  our neuromodulation division  formed following the june acquisition of advanced bionics corporation  generated million in net sales during as compared to million in  which represents the period following the acquisition 
during  we invested a portion of our increased gross profit in various research and development initiatives  particularly related to our acquisition of advanced bionics and our acquisition of trivascular  inc  as well as on projects within our endosurgery group  including our endovations endoscopy suite 
we funded additional headcount and programs to strengthen our sales and marketing organization and we made enhancements to our manufacturing and distribution network 
we continued to generate strong operating cash flow during in addition  due to favorable market conditions  we raised million from the public markets through a november debt offering 
we used cash generated from operating activities and from the public debt issuance to repay short term debt obligations  repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market  and fund strategic alliances and acquisitions 
recent developments on january   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire guidant corporation for an aggregate purchase price of billion net of proceeds from option exercises  which represents a combination of cash and stock worth per share of guidant common stock 
we expect that this acquisition will enable us to become a major provider in the high growth cardiac rhythm management business  significantly diversifying our revenue stream across multiple business segments and enhancing our overall competitive position 
in addition  in conjunction with the acquisition of guidant  abbott laboratories has agreed to acquire guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular businesses and has agreed to share the drug eluting stent technology it acquires from guidant with us 
this will enable us to access a second drug eluting stent program that will complement our existing taxus stent program 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including clearances under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of and the european union merger control regulation  as well as approval of boston scientific and guidant shareholders 
subject to these conditions  we currently expect the acquisition to occur during the week of april  on january   we received a corporate warning letter from the fda notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three facilities and advising us that our corporate wide corrective action plan relating to three warning letters issued to us in was inadequate 
as also stated in this fda warning letter  the fda will not grant our requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve pre market approval applications for our class iii devices to which the quality control or current good manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably related until the deficiencies described in the letter have been corrected 
we intend to resolve the quality issues cited by the fda prior to the anticipated launch of our taxus libert stent system in the united states and therefore do not anticipate delays of this product 
however  while we believe we can remediate these issues in an expeditious manner  there can be no assurances regarding the length of time it will take to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the fda  and any such resolution may require the dedication of significant incremental internal and external resources 
in addition  if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the fda  the fda may take further regulatory actions against us  including but not limited to seizing our product inventory  obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products or assessing civil monetary penalties

us net sales in  our us net sales increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase primarily related to  million in sales of our taxus stent system for as compared to  million for we launched our taxus stent system in the us late in the first quarter of and estimate that physicians in the us have converted approximately percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents as of december   as compared to percent at december  the remainder of the increase in our us net sales related to sales growth of million from our endosurgery group and million from our neuromodulation division 
this increase in sales was offset by decreased taxus stent system sales in the us during the second half of  as compared to the same period in the prior year largely due to a reduction in market share  as well as pricing pressure 
during the first three quarters of  we experienced sequential declines in our market share 
in the fourth quarter of  our market share stabilized and was relatively consistent with the prior quarter 
in  our us net sales increased by  million  or percent  as compared to the increase related primarily to  million in sales of our taxus stent system 
declines in our bare metal stent revenue by million to million in partially offset this increase  as physicians continued to convert the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents  including our taxus stent system 
sales from other products within our cardiovascular division also increased by million  or five percent  during the remainder of the increase in our us revenues related to sales growth in each of our other us divisions  including million in sales from our neuromodulation division 
international net sales in  our international net sales increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase related primarily to sales growth of our taxus stent system by million  or percent  in our europe and inter continental markets 
as of december   we estimate that physicians in our europe and inter continental markets have converted approximately percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents  as compared to approximately percent at the end of conversion rates have been more gradual in these markets than in the us primarily due to the timing of local reimbursement and funding levels 
in addition  we successfully launched our taxus libert stent system in certain inter continental markets during the first quarter of and in europe during the third quarter of the remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to growth in various product franchises  including million in incremental sales from our endosurgery group  and million in sales growth from our neuromodulation division 
in  our japan net sales decreased by million  or six percent  as compared to primarily due to decreased sales from our cardiovascular division 
we have experienced declining coronary stent sales in japan since a competitor launched its drug eluting stent in this market late in the second quarter of due to the timing of regulatory approval for our taxus stent system and government mandated pricing reductions for other products  we do not expect revenue growth in our existing japan business until we receive regulatory approval and launch our drug eluting stent in japan  which we expect to occur in the first half of in  our international net sales increased by million  or percent  as compared to excluding the favorable impact of million of foreign currency fluctuations  international net sales increased percent 
the increase related primarily to sales growth of our taxus stent system by million  or percent  in our europe and inter continental markets 
we launched the taxus stent system in these markets during the first quarter of in addition  in our japan net sales increased by million  or percent  as compared to primarily due to sales of our express stent system  which we launched in japan during the first quarter of the remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to incremental growth in various product franchises  none of which were individually significant 
gross profit the following table provides a summary of our gross profit in millions of net sales of net sales of net sales gross profit    in  our gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  increased by percentage points as compared to shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products  primarily drug eluting coronary stent systems  increased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by percentage points 
our gross profit percentage increased by percentage point related to million in inventory write downs in  including a million write down attributable to our recalls of certain coronary stent systems and a million write down of taxus stent inventory due to shelf life dating 
our gross profit for was reduced as a percentage of net sales by percentage points related to period expenses  including manufacturing start up costs primarily associated with our taxus libert stent system and increased investment in quality initiatives 
the remaining fluctuation in gross profit as a percentage of net sales primarily related to the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
in  our gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  increased by percentage points as compared to shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products  primarily drug eluting coronary stent systems in the us  increased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by percentage points 
this improvement in our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially reduced by percentage point related to million in inventory write downs 
in addition  other expenses primarily associated with increased investments in our manufacturing capabilities reduced gross profit as a percentage of net sales during by approximately percentage point 
operating expenses the following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses in millions of net sales of net sales of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses   research and development expenses royalty expense amortization expense selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in  our sg a expenses increased by million  or four percent  as compared to the increase primarily related to approximately million in increased headcount and higher compensation expense mainly attributable to the expansion of the sales force within our interventional cardiology business unit and endosurgery group and costs related to market development initiatives  million in incremental operating expenses associated with our and acquisitions  primarily advanced bionics  million in employee related costs primarily attributable to optimization initiatives within our human resources function and international divisions  million in stock compensation expense primarily associated with the issuance of deferred stock units in  and million in costs related to certain retirement benefits 
certain charges incurred in partially offset these increases  including a million enhancement to our k plan  and a million non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans 
as a percentage of our net sales  sg a expenses decreased to percent in from percent in primarily due to the increase in our net sales in in  our sg a expenses increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase primarily related to approximately million in additional marketing programs  increased headcount and higher sales force commission expenses  mainly attributable to our taxus stent program and  to a lesser degree  to support our other product franchises  and approximately million due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  our sg a expenses in included charges of million attributable to an enhancement to our k plan and million resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans 
further  our sg a expenses included million in operating expenses associated with our acquisition of advanced bionics 
as a percentage of our net sales  sg a expenses decreased to percent in from percent in primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in research and development expenses our investment in research and development reflects spending on regulatory compliance and clinical research as well as new product development programs 
in  our research and development expenses increased by million  or percent  as compared to as a percentage of our net sales  research and development expenses increased to percent in from percent in the increase primarily related to approximately million in incremental research and development expenses attributable to our and acquisitions  primarily advanced bionics and trivascular 
in addition  we increased spending on internal research and development projects within our endosurgery group by million  including increased spending on our endovations endoscopy suite 
in  our research and development expenses increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase related primarily to an increased investment of approximately million in our cardiovascular division  which was mainly associated with our next generation stent platforms 
in addition  our research and development expenses in included million attributable to our acquisition of advanced bionics 
the remainder of the growth in our research and development spending reflects investments to enhance our clinical and regulatory infrastructure and provide additional funding for research and development on next generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions 
as a percentage of our net sales  research and development expenses decreased to percent in from percent in primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in royalty expense in  our royalty expense increased by million  or percent  as compared to as a percentage of net sales  royalty expense increased to percent in from percent in the increase in our royalty expense related to sales growth of royalty bearing products  primarily sales of our taxus stent system 
royalty expense attributable to sales of our taxus stent system increased by million to million for as compared to in  our royalty expense increased by million  or percent  as compared to as a percentage of net sales  royalty expense increased to percent in from percent in the increase in our royalty expense related to sales growth of royalty bearing products  primarily sales of our taxus stent system 
royalty expense attributable to sales of our taxus stent system increased by million to million for as compared to in november  we exercised our right under an existing licensing agreement with angiotech pharmaceuticals  inc to obtain an exclusive license for the use of paclitaxel and other agents for certain applications in the coronary vascular field 
amortization expense in  our amortization expense increased by million  or percent  as compared to as a percentage of our net sales  amortization expense increased to percent in from percent in the increase in our amortization expense was primarily due to million in incremental amortization expense from the intangible assets obtained in conjunction with our and acquisitions  primarily advanced bionics 
in addition  our amortization expense included a million write off of intangible assets related to our enteryx liquid polymer technology enteryx  a discontinued technology platform obtained as a part of our acquisition of enteric medical technologies  inc the write off resulted from our decision during the third quarter of to cease selling the enteryx product 
in  our amortization expense increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase related primarily to the amortization of intangible assets from our acquisitions in of advanced bionics and precision vascular systems  inc pvs 
amortization expense for these two acquisitions was million in as a percentage of our net sales  amortization expense decreased to percent in from percent in primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in interest expense and other  net our interest expense increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in as compared to related primarily to an increase in average market interest rates on our borrowings 
the increase in as compared to related primarily to an increase in our average debt levels and in average market rates on our floating rate borrowings 
our other  net reflected income of million in  expense of million in  and expense of million in our other  net included asset write downs of million in and million in associated with certain investments in and loans to privately held and publicly traded companies 
we do not believe that these write downs of assets will have a material impact on our future operations 
in  our other  net included realized gains of million from sales of investments in privately held and publicly traded companies 
in addition  our other  net included interest income of million in  million in  and million in our interest income increased in as compared to due to increases in average market interest rates 
our interest income in increased as compared to due primarily to growth in our cash balances 
tax rate the following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate percentage point increase versus versus reported tax rate impact of certain charges in  the increase in our reported tax rate as compared to related primarily to the impact of certain charges during that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate 
these charges include certain litigation related charges  purchased research and development  asset write downs and employee related costs that resulted from certain business optimization initiatives  costs related to certain retirement benefits  and a tax adjustment associated with a technical correction made to the american jobs creation act 
management currently estimates that our effective tax rate  excluding certain charges  will be approximately percent primarily due to our intention to reinvest substantially all of our offshore earnings 
however  geographic changes in the manufacture of our products may positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate 
in  the increase in our reported tax rate as compared to related primarily to the net impact of certain charges during that were taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate 
these charges included a provision for an extraordinary dividend related to overseas cash balances we repatriated in pursuant to the american jobs creation act  an accrual for our legal and regulatory exposures  an enhancement to our k plan  purchased research and development  and a non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans 
in addition  our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by more revenue being generated from products manufactured in lower tax jurisdictions 
litigation related charges and credits in  we recorded a million pre tax charge associated with the medinol litigation settlement 
on september   we reached a settlement with medinol resolving certain contract and patent infringement litigation 
in conjunction with the settlement agreement  we paid million in cash and cancelled our equity investment in medinol 
in  we recorded a million provision for certain legal and regulatory matters  which included the civil settlement with the us department of justice  which was paid in the second quarter of in  we agreed to settle a number of our outstanding product liability cases 
the cost of settlement in excess of our available insurance limits was million 
in addition  during  we recorded a million charge related to an adverse judgment in a suit filed by the federal trade commission 
purchased research and development in  we recorded million of purchased research and development 
our purchased research and development consisted of million relating to our acquisition of trivascular  million relating to our acquisition of advanced stent technologies  inc ast  million relating to our acquisition of rubicon medical corporation  and million relating to our acquisition of cryovascular systems  inc in addition  we recorded million of purchased research and development in conjunction with obtaining distribution rights for new brain monitoring technology that aspect medical systems  one of our strategic partners  is currently developing 
this technology is designed to aid the diagnosis and treatment of depression  alzheimer s disease and other neurological conditions 
the most significant purchased research and development projects included trivascular s abdominal aortic aneurysms aaa stent graft and ast s petal bifurcation stent  which collectively represented percent of our purchased research and development 
trivascular s aaa stent graft design reduces the size of the stent graft by replacing much of the metal stent assembly with a polymer that is injected into channels within the stent graft during the procedure 
during the fourth quarter of  management decided to re design certain aspects of the stent graft to enhance patient safety and to improve product performance 
the re design will result in incremental costs and time to complete the project relative to those expected at the date of acquisition 
we currently expect to launch the aaa stent graft in the us by and to incur approximately million of research and development costs over the next five years to complete the project 
we continue to assess the pace of development and our opportunities within this market  which may result in a delay in the timing of regulatory approval 
ast s petal bifurcation stent is designed to expand into the side vessel when a single vessel branches into two vessels  permitting blood to flow into both branches of the bifurcation and providing support at the junction 
we estimate the cost to complete the petal bifurcation stent to be between million and million 
as of the date we acquired ast  we expected the petal bifurcation stent to be commercially available on a worldwide basis within six years in a drug eluting configuration 
in  we recorded million of purchased research and development 
our purchased research and development consisted primarily of million relating to our acquisition of advanced bionics and million relating to our acquisition of pvs 
the most significant in process projects acquired in connection with our acquisitions included advanced bionics bion microstimulator and drug delivery pump  which collectively represented percent of our acquired in process projects value 
the bion microstimulator is an implantable neurostimulation device designed to treat a variety of neurological conditions  including migraine headaches and urge incontinence 
the cost to complete the bion microstimulator is estimated to be between million and million 
we expect that the bion microstimulator will be commercially available within three years 
the advanced bionics drug delivery pump is an implanted programmable device designed to treat chronic pain 
the cost to complete the drug delivery pump is estimated to be between million and million 
we continue to assess the pace of development and our opportunities for the drug delivery pump  which may result in a delay in the timing of regulatory approval 
in  we recorded million of purchased research and development 
our purchased research and development consisted of million relating to our acquisition of inflow dynamics  inc and million relating primarily to certain acquisitions we consummated in prior years 
the in process projects acquired in connection with our acquisition of inflow were not significant to our consolidated results 
the purchased research and development associated with the prior years acquisitions related primarily to our acquisition of embolic protection  inc and resulted from consideration that was contingent at the date of acquisition  but earned during in connection with our acquisitions  we acquired several in process projects  including smart therapeutics  inc s atherosclerosis stent 
the atherosclerosis stent is a self expanding nitinol stent designed to treat narrowing of the arteries around the brain 
during  we completed the atherosclerosis stent in process project and received humanitarian device exemption approval to begin selling this technology on a limited basis 
the total cost for us to complete the project was approximately million 
in connection with our acquisitions  we acquired several significant in process projects  including interventional technologies  inc s next generation cutting balloon device 
the cutting balloon device is a novel balloon angioplasty device with mounted scalpels that relieve stress in the artery  reducing the force necessary to expand the vessel 
during  we completed the cutting balloon in process project and received fda approval for this technology 
the total cost for us to complete the project was approximately million 
outlook coronary stents coronary stent revenue represented percent of our consolidated net sales during  and approximated  million in as compared to  million in we estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market will approximate billion in  as compared to billion in drug eluting stents are estimated to represent approximately percent of the dollar value of the worldwide coronary stent market in and percent in as of the fourth quarter of  we believe that the us stent market has been substantially penetrated and estimate that physicians in the us have converted approximately percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents 
we have experienced declines in our us drug eluting stent revenues in the second half of as compared to the same period in the prior year largely as a result of a reduction in market share  as well as pricing pressure 
during the first three quarters of  we experienced sequential declines in our market share 
in the fourth quarter of  our market share stabilized and was relatively consistent with the prior quarter 
we expect to launch our taxus libert stent system in the us during the second half of  subject to regulatory approval 
as of the fourth quarter of  we estimate that physicians in our europe and inter continental markets have converted approximately percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare metal stents to drug eluting stents  as compared to approximately percent at the end of we expect that conversion rates will continue to increase in our europe and inter continental markets 
we successfully launched our taxus libert stent system in certain inter continental markets during the first quarter of and in europe during the third quarter of we believe our taxus libert stent system represents a driver of future revenue in these markets 
further  we expect to launch our taxus express stent system in japan during the first half of  subject to regulatory approval  where we estimate the size of the market in to approximate million 
historically  the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business  we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs  patient populations and trial endpoints 
unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us  by our competitors or by third parties  or the market s perception of this clinical data  may adversely impact our position in and share of the drug eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market 
we believe that we can maintain a leadership position within the drug eluting stent markets in which we compete for a variety of reasons  including the positive and consistent results of our taxus clinical trials  the performance benefits of our current technology  the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products and the planned launch sequence of these products  our overall market leadership in interventional medicine and our sizeable interventional cardiology sales force  and our significant investments in our sales  clinical  marketing and manufacturing capabilities 
a material decline in our drug eluting stent revenue would have a significant adverse impact on our future operating results 
the most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting coronary stent market and our position within this market include entry of additional competitors in international markets and the us  declines in the average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems  variations in clinical results or product performance of our and our competitions products  new competitive product launches  delayed or limited regulatory approvals and reimbursement policies  litigation related to intellectual property  continued physician confidence in our technology  the average number of stents used per procedure  expansion of indications for use  a reduction in the overall number of procedures performed  the international adoption rate of drug eluting stent technology  and the level of supply of our drug eluting stent system and competitive stent systems 
our drug eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug eluting products in the us market 
our share of the drug eluting stent market  as well as unit prices  are expected to continue to be adversely impacted as additional significant competitors enter the drug eluting stent market  which began during the third quarter of internationally and is expected to occur during the second half of in the us the manufacture of our taxus stent system involves the integration of multiple technologies  critical components  raw materials and complex processes 
significant favorable or unfavorable changes in forecasted demand as well as disruptions associated with our taxus stent manufacturing process may impact our inventory levels 
variability in expected demand or the timing of the launch of next generation products may result in excess or expired inventory positions and future inventory charges 
regulatory compliance the trend in countries around the world  including the us and japan  toward more stringent regulatory requirements for product clearance  changing reimbursement models and more rigorous inspection and enforcement activities has generally caused or may cause medical device manufacturers like us to experience more uncertainty  delay  risk and expense 
on january   we received a corporate warning letter from the fda notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three facilities and advising us that our corporate wide corrective action plan relating to three warning letters issued to us in was inadequate 
as also stated in this fda warning letter  the fda will not grant our requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve pre market approval applications for our class iii devices to which the quality control or current good manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably related until the deficiencies described in the letter have been corrected 
we intend to resolve the quality issues cited by the fda prior to the anticipated launch of our taxus libert stent system in the united states and therefore do not anticipate delays of this product 
however  while we believe we can remediate these issues in an expeditious manner  there can be no assurances regarding the length of time it will take to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the fda  and any such resolution will likely require the dedication of significant incremental internal and external resources 
in addition  if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the fda  the fda may take further regulatory actions against us  including but not limited to seizing our product inventory  obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products or assessing civil monetary penalties 
intellectual property litigation there continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market and medical device industry 
we are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings with our competitors  including johnson johnson and medtronic  inc there can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings would not impact our ability to meet our objectives in the market 
see item legal proceedings and note j commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a description of these legal proceedings 
innovation our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances 
our research and development program is largely focused on the development of next generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions 
we expect to continue to invest aggressively in our drug eluting stent program to achieve sustained worldwide market leadership positions 
we successfully launched our taxus libert stent system in certain inter continental markets during the first quarter of and in europe during the third quarter of we expect to launch our taxus libert stent system in the us during the second half of  subject to regulatory approval 
further  we anticipate continuing our increased focus and spending on areas outside of drug eluting stent technology 
we believe our focus will be primarily on technologies in which we have already made significant investments  including neuromodulation  endoscopic systems  carotid stenting  and bifurcation stenting  but may also extend into other medical device opportunities 
however  given their early stage of development  there can be no assurance that these technologies will achieve technological feasibility  obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 
a delay in the development or approval of these technologies or our decision to reduce funding of these projects may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth 
our acquisitions and alliances are intended to expand further our ability to offer our customers effective  quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs 
management believes it has developed a sound plan to integrate acquired businesses 
however  our failure to integrate these businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic and financial objectives of these transactions 
potential future acquisitions  including companies with whom we currently have strategic alliances or options to purchase  may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional financing  depending on their size and nature 
further  in connection with these acquisitions and other strategic alliances  we have acquired numerous in process research and development projects 
as we continue to undertake strategic initiatives  it is reasonable to assume that we will acquire additional in process research and development projects 
in addition  we have entered a significant number of strategic alliances with privately held and publicly traded companies 
many of these alliances involve equity investments and often give us the option to acquire the other company or assets of the other company in the future 
we enter these strategic alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets 
the success of these alliances is an important element of our growth strategy and we will continue to seek market opportunities and growth through investments in selective strategic alliances and acquisitions 
however  the full benefit of these alliances is often dependent on the strength of the other companies underlying technology and ability to execute 
an inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings  or litigation related to these technologies  among other factors  may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these alliances 
our agreement to distribute certain guidewire and sheath products will expire during the first quarter of management has identified some replacements for these products 
the sales level associated with the replacement products is expected to be less than that of our previously distributed products 
international markets international markets are also being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs 
our profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions  foreign currency fluctuations  regulatory and reimbursement approvals  competitive offerings  infrastructure development  rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy 
any significant changes in the competitive  political  regulatory  reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we are required to renew regulatory approvals in certain international jurisdictions  which may require additional testing and documentation 
if sufficient resources are not available to renew these approvals or these approvals are not timely renewed  our ability to market our full line of existing products within these jurisdictions may be limited 
guidant acquisition on january   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire guidant corporation for an aggregate purchase price of billion net of proceeds from option exercises  which represents a combination of cash and stock worth per share of guidant common stock 
we expect that this acquisition will enable us to become a major provider in the high growth cardiac rhythm management business  significantly diversifying our revenue stream across multiple business segments and enhancing our overall competitive position 
in addition  in conjunction with the acquisition of guidant  abbott laboratories has agreed to acquire guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular businesses and has agreed to share the drug eluting stent technology it acquires from guidant with us 
this will enable us to access a second drug eluting stent program that will complement our existing taxus coronary stent program 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including clearances under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act and the european union merger control regulation  as well as approval of boston scientific and guidant shareholders 
subject to these conditions  we currently expect the acquisition to occur during the week of april  in connection with the acquisition  boston scientific will issue to guidant shareholders and abbott shares of boston scientific common stock 
as a result of the issuance of these shares  current boston scientific stockholders will own a smaller percentage of boston scientific after the acquisition 
we expect our weighted average shares outstanding  assuming dilution  to increase from approximately million for to approximately billion following the acquisition 
the acquisition will also result in significant dilution to our earnings per share 
the integration of guidant s operations and product lines with boston scientific will be complex and time consuming  and the separation of the guidant businesses required by the abbott transaction will add complexity to the transition process 
the failure to integrate boston scientific and guidant successfully and to manage the challenges presented by the transition process successfully  including the retention of key guidant personnel  may result in the combined company and its stockholders not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of the acquisition 
in addition  the combined company will incur integration and restructuring costs following the completion of the acquisition as boston scientific integrates certain operations of guidant 
although boston scientific and guidant expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction  merger related and restructuring costs over time  no assurances can be made that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term  or at all 
completion of the acquisition is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental authorizations  consents  orders and approvals  including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period  and any extension of the waiting period  under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended  and approval under the european union merger control regulation 
these consents  orders and approvals may impose conditions on  or require divestitures relating to  the divisions  operations or assets of boston scientific or guidant  in addition to the purchase by abbott of guidant s vascular and endovascular businesses  and could require modification to the terms of the abbott transaction agreement in a manner adverse to boston scientific or the combined company 
these conditions or divestitures may jeopardize or delay completion of the abbott transaction or the acquisition or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the abbott transaction or the acquisition 
further  no assurance can be given that the required consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied  and  if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the conditions are satisfied  no assurance can be given as to the terms  conditions and timing of the approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the merger agreement 
additionally  completion of the acquisition is conditioned on the absence of certain restraining orders or injunctions by judgment  court order or law that would restrain or prohibit consummation of the acquisition 
boston scientific and guidant have received recent claims related to the acquisition from plaintiffs seeking an injunction to prohibit consummation of the acquisition and other relief  including monetary damages 
liquidity and capital resources the following table provides a summary of key performance indicators that we use to assess our liquidity and operating performance in millions cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities cash provided by operating activities  cash used for investing activities  cash used for provided by financing activities ebitda   the following represents a reconciliation between ebitda and net income in millions net income  income taxes interest expense interest income depreciation and amortization ebitda   management uses ebitda to assess operating performance and believes that it may assist users of our financial statements in analyzing the underlying trends in our business over time 
users of our financial statements should consider this non gaap financial information in addition to  not as a substitute for  or as superior to  financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
our ebitda included pre tax charges of  million in  million in and million in the pre tax charges consisted of a litigation settlement with medinol  purchased research and development  costs that resulted from certain business optimization initiatives  and expenses related to certain retirement benefits 
the pre tax charges consisted of a provision for certain legal and regulatory matters  which included a civil settlement with the us department of justice  an enhancement to our k plan  purchased research and development and a non cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans 
the pre tax charges consisted of purchased research and development and charges related to litigation and product liability settlements 
operating activities cash generated by our operating activities continues to provide a major source of funds for investing in our growth 
the decrease in cash generated by our operating activities in as compared to is primarily attributable to the decrease in ebitda and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
the decrease in ebitda in as compared to reflects our third quarter settlement with medinol  which was partially offset by increased sales of our taxus stent system during we invested a portion of the cash from sales of our taxus stent system in our sales  clinical and manufacturing capabilities  and in research and development projects 
significant cash flow effects from our operating assets and liabilities in included decreases in cash flow of million attributable to accounts payable and accrued expenses  million attributable to inventories  million attributable to prepaid expenses and other assets  and million attributable to taxes payable and other liabilities 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses in as compared to related to our million provision for certain legal and regulatory matters  which included a civil settlement with the department of justice  and our one time million k contribution  which were both paid during june the increase in inventories in as compared to related primarily to the accumulation of inventory to fulfill worldwide demand for our taxus stent system and our neuromodulation products 
the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in as compared to was attributable to the establishment of a tax related receivable 
the decrease in taxes payable and other liabilities in as compared to primarily related to million in tax payments made during including those associated with cash repatriated under the american jobs creation act and to the expected tax benefit associated with the settlement agreement with medinol 
the decrease in taxes payable in as compared to was partially offset by the increase in taxes payable associated with our earnings 
investing activities we made capital expenditures of million in as compared to million in the increase primarily related to capital spending to enhance our manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million during excluding guidant  which includes additional capital expenditures to allow further growth in our endosurgery group and neuromodulation division  and certain business optimization initiatives in our human resources function  primarily outsourcing costs 
our investing activities during also included million of net payments primarily attributable to our acquisitions of rubicon  trivascular and cryovascular  million of acquisition earn out payments primarily associated with prior acquisitions  and million of payments related to our strategic alliances with both privately held and publicly traded companies 
financing activities our cash flows from financing activities reflect proceeds from long term public debt issuances  repayment of short term borrowings  payments for share repurchases  and proceeds from option exercises related to our equity incentive programs 
the following table provides a summary at december of our net debt in millions short term debt  long term debt   gross debt   less cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  net debt  we had outstanding borrowings of  million at december  at a weighted average interest rate of percent as compared to outstanding borrowings of  million at december  at a weighted average interest rate of percent 
during  we made net payments on borrowings of million 
our cash and cash equivalents are primarily held by our non us operations 
in  we repatriated approximately  million in extraordinary dividends as defined in the american jobs creation act from our non us operations 
the american jobs creation act created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
as of december   we had recorded a tax liability of million for the amounts we intended to repatriate in under the american jobs creation act 
in  we repatriated earnings of non us subsidiaries that did not qualify under the american jobs creation act 
the resulting tax liabilities associated with this repatriation were million 
in addition  during  we made a decision to repatriate additional amounts from certain of our non us operations 
in connection with this decision  we established a deferred tax liability of million that we believe is adequate to cover the taxes related to this repatriation 
borrowings and credit arrangements revolving credit facilities during  we refinanced our revolving credit facilities to extend the maturity of one credit facility and to reduce borrowing capacity by million 
at december   our revolving credit facilities totaled approximately  million  as compared to  million at december  our revolving credit facilities at december  consisted of a  million credit facility that terminates in may  a million credit facility that terminates in may and contains an option to increase the facility size by an additional million in the future  and a million uncommitted credit facility that terminates in may our use of the borrowings is unrestricted and the borrowings are unsecured 
our credit facilities provide us with borrowing capacity and support our commercial paper program 
we had million of commercial paper outstanding at december  at a weighted average interest rate of percent and million outstanding at december  at a weighted average interest rate of percent 
in september  we repaid billion japanese yen approximately million in credit facility borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of percent 
during  we decreased our credit and security facility that is secured by our us trade receivables from million to million  effective april  during the first quarter of  we expect to increase this facility from million to million 
the credit and security facility terminates in august borrowing availability under this facility changes based upon the amount of eligible receivables  concentration of eligible receivables and other factors 
certain significant changes in the quality of our receivables may require us to repay borrowings immediately under the facility 
the credit agreement required us to create a wholly owned entity  which is consolidated 
this entity purchases our us trade accounts receivable and then borrows from two third party financial institutions using these receivables as collateral 
the receivables and related borrowings remain on the balance sheet because we have the right to prepay any borrowings outstanding and effectively retain control over the receivables 
accordingly  pledged receivables are included as trade accounts receivable  net  while the corresponding borrowings are included as debt on the consolidated balance sheets 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit and security facility as of december  or december  in addition  we have uncommitted credit facilities with two commercial japanese banks that provide for borrowings and promissory notes discounting of up to billion japanese yen translated to million at december  and million at december  
approximately million of notes receivable were discounted at an average interest rate of percent at december  and million of notes receivable were discounted at an average interest rate of percent at december  as of december  and december   we intended to repay all of our short term debt obligations within the next twelve month period 
senior notes we had senior notes of  million outstanding at december  and  million outstanding at december  in november  we issued million of senior notes due november november notes and million of senior notes due november november notes under a  million shelf registration statement filed with the sec in november the november notes bear a semi annual coupon of percent  are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
the november notes bear a semi annual coupon of percent  are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
these are publicly registered securities 
in december  we announced our intent to supplement the terms of our november notes and november notes to provide for a potential interest rate adjustment accruing from november  on each series of these senior notes in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded as a result of the closing of our proposed acquisition of guidant 
the interest rate on these senior notes will be subject to a one time increase based on our initial credit ratings 
based on preliminary indications from the rating agencies  we expect that the interest rate on each of our november notes and our november notes may increase by percent 
we will be unable to determine the actual increase  if any  of the interest rate on each of the november notes and november notes until after the closing of our proposed acquisition of guidant 
any subsequent rating improvements will result in a decrease in the adjusted interest rate 
the interest rate on the date these senior notes were originally issued will be permanently reinstated if and when the lowest credit ratings assigned to these senior notes is either a or a or higher 
in march  we repaid million of senior notes that were outstanding at december  the notes bore a semi annual coupon of percent  were not redeemable prior to maturity and were not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
in november  we issued million of senior notes due january january notes and million of senior notes due january january notes under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec in november the january notes bear a semi annual coupon of percent  are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
the january notes bear a semi annual coupon of percent  are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
these senior notes are publicly registered securities 
we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps indexed to six month libor  which approximated percent at december  and percent at december   to hedge against changes in the fair value of these senior notes 
in june  we issued million of senior notes due june june notes under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
the june notes bear a semi annual coupon of percent  are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements 
these senior notes are publicly registered securities 
we entered into fixed to floating interest rate swaps indexed to six month libor  which approximated percent at december  and percent at december   to hedge against changes in the fair value of these senior notes 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for further discussion regarding the treatment of our interest rate swaps 
the remainder of our outstanding borrowings  including capital lease arrangements  was immaterial at december  and december  equity we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million in  million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million in  and million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million in since  we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock and we have approximately million shares of our common stock held in treasury at year end 
approximately million shares remain under our previous share repurchase authorizations 
repurchased shares are available for reissuance under our equity incentive plans and for general corporate purposes  including strategic alliances and acquisitions 
during  we received million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options vary from period to period based upon  among other factors  fluctuations in the exercise patterns of employees 
guidant acquisition at the effective time of the acquisition  each share of guidant common stock will be converted into the right to receive i in cash and ii a number of shares of boston scientific common stock equal to  subject to the calculation of the exchange ratio 
see note o subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for further details regarding the exchange ratio that will be used in determining the purchase price 
under the terms of the abbott transaction agreement and at the closing of the abbott transaction  abbott has agreed to pay an initial purchase price of billion in cash plus potential future earn out payments for the guidant vascular and endovascular businesses  make a five year subordinated loan of million to us at a percent annual interest rate  and purchase billion in shares of boston scientific common stock 
in connection with the financing of the cash portion of the purchase price  various banks have committed to providing up to billion in financing  which includes a billion day interim credit facility  a billion five year term loan facility and a billion five year revolving credit facility 
the interim credit facility  term loan and revolving credit facility will bear interest at libor plus an interest margin between percent high a rating and percent low bbb rating 
the interest margin will be based on the highest two out of three of our long term  senior unsecured  corporate credit ratings from moody s investor service  inc  standard poor s rating services and fitch ratings 
of the billion available pursuant to the commitment letter  we expect to borrow approximately billion to finance the cash portion of the guidant acquisition purchase price  which includes the billion five year term loan facility and billion in borrowings under the day interim credit facility 
we also expect to use the million loan from abbott  for a total of billion in borrowings to finance the cash portion of the purchase price 
in  we anticipate filing a new public registration statement with the sec under which we intend to issue senior notes in order to refinance any borrowings outstanding under the interim credit facility and to register shares that we will issue to abbott 
the new five year revolving credit facility will replace our existing billion credit facilities 
we also plan to use cash on hand and cash from the abbott transaction to fund the cash portion of the guidant purchase price 
if the acquisition is completed  we intend to dedicate a significant portion of our future cash flow from operations to repay our outstanding debt obligations 
we currently have investment grade credit ratings 
during february  our credit rating was downgraded 
the rating agencies have also indicated that they will further downgrade our credit ratings when the guidant acquisition is consummated 
however  we expect our credit ratings to remain at investment grade levels following the acquisition 
our credit ratings affect our cost of borrowings 
if our credit ratings were to be downgraded below investment grade  our borrowing costs may increase and we may be subject to more stringent terms and conditions than those currently contained in our financing arrangements 
in addition  our authorized common stock will be increased from  shares to  shares in conjunction with our proposed acquisition of guidant 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments 
see notes d  f  h and o to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional information regarding our business combinations  long term debt  lease arrangements  and subsequent events 
payments due by period in millions year or less years years after years total debt principal   interest payments  debt  including interest   operating leases purchase obligations  minimum royalty obligations total   debt as reported in our consolidated balance sheets includes the mark to market effect of our interest rate swaps and is net of the unamortized investor discount associated with the issuance of senior notes in conjunction with our various public debt offerings 
in accordance with us gaap  these obligations are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
these obligations related primarily to inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business 
on january   we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire guidant corporation for an aggregate purchase price of billion net of proceeds from option exercises  which represents a combination of cash and stock worth per share of guidant common stock 
in addition  in conjunction with the acquisition of guidant  abbott has agreed to acquire guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular businesses 
see note o subsequent events to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for further details regarding the transaction 
certain of our business combinations involve the payment of contingent consideration 
certain of these payments are based on multiples of the acquired company s revenue during the earn out period and  consequently  we cannot currently determine the total payments 
however  we have developed an estimate of the maximum potential contingent consideration for each of our acquisitions with an outstanding earn out obligation 
at december   the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration undiscounted that we could be required to make associated with our business combinations is approximately billion  some of which may be payable in our common stock 
the milestones associated with the contingent consideration must be reached in certain future periods ranging from through the estimated cumulative specified revenue level associated with these maximum future contingent payments is approximately billion 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  the acquired companies will reach their performance milestones or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues  the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above 
in addition  we are currently considering the exercise of our option to acquire endotex interventional systems  inc  a developer of stents used in the treatment of stenotic lesions in the carotid arteries 
in conjunction with the acquisition of endotex  we would pay approximately million in addition to our previous investments and notes issued of approximately million  plus future consideration that is contingent upon endotex achieving certain performance related milestones 
further  many of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future or require us to make certain payments that are contingent upon the company achieving certain product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  we will exercise our option to acquire these companies or be required to make these contingent payments  we have not included future potential payments relating to these equity investments in the table above 
critical accounting policies we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
we describe these accounting polices in note a significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
these estimates are considered critical if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period 
the following are areas that we consider to be critical revenue recognition our revenue primarily consists of the sale of single use medical devices 
revenue is considered to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor  unless a consignment arrangement exists 
we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage  which indicates that the sale is complete 
we generally allow our customers to return defective  damaged and  in certain cases  expired products for credit 
our estimate for sales returns is based upon contractual commitments and historical trends and is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
we offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers 
we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current 
we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates 
if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably  we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered 
inventories we state inventories at the lower of first in  first out cost or market 
we base our provisions for excess or expired inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales levels 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future 
we record provisions for inventory located in our manufacturing and distribution facilities as cost of sales 
consignment inventory write downs are charged to selling  general and administrative expense and approximated million in  million in  and million in valuation of business combinations we record intangible assets acquired in recent business combinations under the purchase method of accounting 
we allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets  including purchased research and development 
the fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill 
the use of alternative purchase price allocations and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods 
the valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in process projects 
our purchased research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region 
we expense the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of the acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects  or for the acquisitions as a whole 
we use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors 
in arriving at the value of the in process projects  we consider  among other factors  the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
for the in process projects we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions  we used the following risk adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows in  percent to percent  in  percent to percent  and in  percent 
we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
amortization and impairment of intangible assets we record intangible assets at historical cost 
we amortize our intangible assets subject to amortization  including patents  licenses  developed technology and core technology  using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we review these intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life 
we also review our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of our assets and comparing the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values 
we test goodwill during the second quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
in performing the test  we calculate the fair value of the reporting units as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates 
we have not recorded impairment of goodwill in any of the years included in our consolidated statements of operations 
investments in strategic alliances as of december   we had investments in strategic alliances totaling million 
as of december   we had investments in strategic alliances totaling million 
these assets primarily represent investments in privately held and publicly traded equity securities 
we account for investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold percent or less of the voting stock 
we account for investments in companies over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method 
our determination of whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an investment requires judgment 
as of december   we held investments totaling million in three companies that we accounted for under the equity method 
our ownership percentages in these companies range from approximately percent to percent 
as of december   we held investments totaling million in two companies that we accounted for under the equity method 
our ownership percentages in these companies range from approximately percent to percent 
factors that we consider in determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence include  but are not limited to our level of representation on the board of directors  our participation in the investee s policy making processes  transactions with the investee in the ordinary course of business  interchange of managerial personnel  the investee s technological dependency on us  and our ownership in relation to the concentration of other shareholdings 
for investments accounted for under the equity method  we initially record the investment at cost  and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee  including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial statements 
amounts recorded to adjust the carrying amounts of investments accounted for under the equity method were not material to our statements of operations in  or when we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over an investee  we follow the cost method of accounting 
we regularly review our strategic alliance investments for impairment indicators 
examples of events or circumstances that may indicate that an investment is impaired include  but are not limited to  a significant deterioration in earnings performance  a significant adverse change in the regulatory  economic or technological environment of an investee  or a significant doubt about an investee s ability to continue as a going concern 
if we determine that impairment exists and it is other than temporary  we will reduce the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value and will recognize an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
our exposure to loss related to our strategic alliances is generally limited to our equity investments  notes receivable and intangible assets associated with these alliances 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we recognized net deferred tax liabilities aggregating million at december  and million at december  the liabilities relate principally to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and earnings of our non us subsidiaries to be remitted in the future 
the assets relate principally to the establishment of inventory and product related reserves  purchased research and development  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
in light of our historical financial performance  we believe these assets will be substantially recovered 
see note i income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a detailed analysis of our deferred tax positions 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider relevant evidence  both positive and negative  to determine the need for a valuation allowance 
information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years  as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years 
we provide for income taxes payable related to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that may be repatriated in the foreseeable future 
income taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where such earnings have been permanently reinvested in our foreign operations 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are permanently reinvested in foreign operations 
unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested are  million at december  and  million at december  we provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions 
in the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
legal costs we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings  including intellectual property  breach of contract  securities litigation and product liability suits 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
we accrue costs of settlement  damages and  under certain conditions  costs of defense when a loss is deemed probable and such costs are estimable 
otherwise  we expense these costs as incurred 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
our accrual for regulatory and litigation related costs that were probable and estimable was million at december  and million at december  see further discussion of our individual material legal proceedings in item legal proceedings above and note j commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
as of december   a range of loss associated with these individual material legal proceedings can not be estimated due to uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the proceedings 
product liability costs and securities litigation claims we are substantially self insured with respect to general  product liability and securities litigation claims 
in the normal course of business  product liability and securities litigation claims are asserted against us 
we accrue anticipated costs of litigation and loss for product liability and securities litigation claims based on historical experience  or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable 
we record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable 
our accrual for product liability and securities litigation claims was million at december  and million at december  product liability and securities litigation claims against us will likely be asserted in the future related to events not known to management at the present time 
the absence of significant third party insurance coverage increases our exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions 
however  based on product liability and securities litigation losses experienced in the past  our election to become substantially self insured is not expected to have a material impact on our future operations 
management believes that our risk management practices  including limited insurance coverage  are reasonably adequate to protect us against anticipated general  product liability and securities litigation losses 
however  unanticipated catastrophic losses could have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
costs associated with exit activities we accrue employee termination costs associated with an ongoing benefit arrangement if the obligation is attributed to prior services rendered  the rights to the benefits have vested and the payment is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we generally record such costs into expense over the future service period  if any 
in addition  in conjunction with an employee termination  we may offer voluntary termination benefits to employees 
these benefits are recorded when the employee accepts the termination benefits and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
other costs associated with exit activities may include costs related to leased facilities to be abandoned or subleased and long lived asset impairments 
during  we recorded charges associated with exit activities of approximately million 
these charges included costs primarily attributable to employee terminations and outsourcing costs within our human resources function and international divisions  and a million write off of intangible assets related to our enteryx technology 
the recognition of charges associated with exit activities requires our management to make judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing  and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity 
management s estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure their adequacy  that no excess accruals are retained and that utilization of the provisions are for their intended purposes in accordance with developed exit plans 
new accounting standard during  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
statement no 
r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and amends statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
in general  statement no 
r contains similar accounting concepts as those described in statement no 
however  statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
alternative phase in methods are allowed under statement no 
r 
we adopted statement no 
r on its effective date of january  using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized a based on the requirements of statement no 
r for all share based payments granted on or after january  and b based on the requirements of statement no 
for all unvested awards that were granted to employees prior to january  we expect to apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which will then be amortized on a straight line basis 
as permitted by statement no 
 for periods prior to january   we accounted for share based payments to employees using opinion no 
s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for the granting of employee stock options  except as disclosed in note l stock ownership plans to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
accordingly  the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method will negatively impact our statements of operations 
the impact of adoption of statement no 
r cannot be quantified at this time because it will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future  expected volatilities and expected useful lives  among other factors  present at the grant date 
however  had statement no 
r been effective in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement no 
as described in our disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per share in note a significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
statement no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under currently effective accounting literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption of statement no 
r 
while we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was million in  million in and million in further  most of our stock option awards provide for immediate vesting upon retirement  death or disability of the participant 
we have traditionally accounted for the pro forma compensation expense related to stock based awards made to retirement eligible individuals using the stated vesting period of the grant 
this approach results in recognizing compensation expense over the vesting period except in the instance of the participant s actual retirement 
statement no 
r clarified the accounting for stock based awards made to retirement eligible individuals  which explicitly provides that the vesting period for a grant made to a retirement eligible employee is considered non substantive and should be ignored when determining the period over which the award should be expensed 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we will be required to expense stock based awards over the period between grant date and retirement eligibility or immediately if the employee is retirement eligible at the date of grant 
if we had historically accounted for stock based awards made to retirement eligible individuals under these requirements  the pro forma expense disclosed in note a would not have been materially impacted for the periods presented

we address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures 
furthermore  we manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by monitoring outstanding positions 
our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments  forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries 
we use both nonderivative primarily european manufacturing operations and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates 
we had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of  million at december  and  million at december  the decrease in the outstanding amount of our currency derivative instruments is primarily due to the maturity of hedge contracts 
we recorded million of other assets and million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments at december  as compared to million of other assets and million of other liabilities recorded at december  a percent appreciation in the us dollar s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments fair value by million at december  and by million at december  a percent depreciation in the us dollar s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by million at december  and million at december  any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset  liability or cash flow 
our earnings and cash flow are exposed to interest rate changes on us dollar denominated debt partially offset by interest rate changes on us dollar denominated cash investments

we had interest rate swaps outstanding in the notional amount of  million at december  and  million at december  our interest rate swaps hedge against potential changes in the fair value of certain of our senior notes and are designated as fair value hedges 
the decrease in the notional amount of our interest rate swaps is due to the maturing of hedge contracts related to our million percent senior notes  which we repaid upon maturity during march to recognize the fair value of these interest rate swaps  we recorded million of other assets and million of other liabilities at december  as compared to million of other assets and million of other liabilities at december  a one percentage point increase in global interest rates would decrease the derivative instruments fair value by million at december  as compared to million at december  a one percentage point decrease in global interest rates would increase the derivative instruments fair value by million at december  as compared to million at december  any increase or decrease in the fair value of our interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying liability
