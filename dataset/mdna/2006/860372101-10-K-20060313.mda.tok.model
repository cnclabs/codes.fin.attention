item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
title the title segment includes the functions of searching  examining  closing and insuring the condition of the title to real property 
examination and closing 
the purpose of a title examination is to ascertain the ownership of the property being transferred  debts that are owed on it and the scope of the title policy coverage 
this involves searching for and examining documents such as deeds  mortgages  wills  divorce decrees  court judgments  liens  paving assessments and tax records 
at the closing or settlement of a sale transaction  the seller executes and delivers a deed to the new owner 
the buyer typically signs new mortgage documents 
closing funds are then disbursed to the seller  the prior mortgage company  real estate brokers  the title company and others 
the documents are then recorded in the public records 
a title policy is generally issued to both the lender and the new owner 
title policies 
lenders in the united states generally require title insurance as a condition to making a loan on real estate  including securitized lending 
this is to assure lenders of the priority of their lien position 
the purchasers of the property want insurance to protect against claims that may arise against the ownership of the property 
the face amount of the policy is normally the purchase price or the amount of the related loan 
title insurance is substantially different from other types of insurance 
fire  auto  health and life insurance protect against future losses and events 
in contrast  title insurance insures against losses from past events and seeks to eliminate most risks through the examination and settlement process 
investments 
our title insurance underwriters maintain investments in accordance with certain statutory requirements for the funding of statutory premium reserves and state deposits 
we have established policies and procedures to minimize our exposure to changes in the fair values of our investments 
these policies include retaining an investment advisory firm  emphasizing credit quality  managing portfolio duration  maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates  and actively managing profile and security mix based upon market conditions 
all of our investments are classified as available for sale 
losses 
losses on policies occur when a title defect is not discovered during the examination and settlement process 
reasons for losses include forgeries  misrepresentations  unrecorded liens  the failure to pay off existing liens  mishandling of settlement funds  issuance by title agencies of unauthorized coverages and other legal issues 
some claimants seek damages in excess of policy limits 
those claims are based on various legal theories usually alleging misrepresentation by an agency 
although we vigorously defend against spurious claims  we have from time to time incurred losses in excess of policy limits 

table of contents experience shows that most claims against policies and claim payments are made in the first six years after the policy has been issued  although claims are also incurred and paid many years later 
by their nature  claims are often complex  vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time of settlement of the claims 
estimating future title loss payments is difficult because of the complex nature of title claims  the length of time over which claims are paid  the significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors 
provisions for policy losses are charged to income in the same year the related premium revenues are recognized 
the amounts provided are based on reported claims  historical loss experience  title industry averages  current legal environment and types of policies written 
our liability for estimated title losses comprises both known claims and claims expected to be reported in the future 
the amount of our loss reserve represents the aggregate future payments  net of recoveries  that we expect to incur on policy and escrow losses and in costs to settle claims 
amounts shown as our estimated liability for future loss payments are continually reviewed by us for reasonableness and adjusted as appropriate 
independent actuaries also reviewed the adequacy of the liability amounts on an annual basis and found our reserves adequate at each year end 
in accordance with industry practice  the amounts have not been discounted to their present values 
factors affecting revenues 
title revenues are closely related to the level of activity in the real estate markets we serve and the prices at which real estate sales are made 
real estate sales are directly affected by the availability and cost of money to finance purchases 
other factors include consumer confidence and demand by buyers 
these factors may override the seasonal nature of the title business 
generally  our first quarter is the least active and the fourth quarter is the most active in terms of title revenues 
selected information for the national real estate industry follows figures are preliminary and subject to revision new home sales in millions existing home sales in millions existing home sales median sales price in thousands customers 
the primary sources of title business are attorneys  builders  developers  lenders and real estate brokers 
no one customer was responsible for as much as ten percent of our title operating revenues in any of the last three years 
titles insured include residential and commercial properties  undeveloped acreage  farms  ranches and water rights 
service  location  financial strength  size and related factors affect customer acceptance 
increasing market share is accomplished primarily by providing superior service 
the parties to a closing are concerned with personal schedules and the interest and other costs associated with any delays in the settlement 
the rates charged to customers are regulated  to varying degrees  in many states 
financial strength and stability of the title underwriter are important factors in maintaining and increasing our agency network 
among the nation s leading title insurers  we earned one of the highest ratings awarded by the title industry s leading rating companies 
our principal underwriter  stewart title guaranty company guaranty is currently rated a by demotech  inc  a by fitch and a by lace financial 
market share 
title insurance statistics are compiled quarterly by the title industry s national association 
based on unconsolidated statutory net premiums written through september   guaranty is one of the leading title insurers in the united states 
our principal competitors include fidelity national financial  inc  the first american corporation and landamerica financial group  inc like most title insurers  we also compete with abstractors  attorneys who issue title opinions and attorney owned title insurance funds 
a number of homebuilders  financial institutions  real estate brokers and others own or control title insurance agencies  some of which issue policies underwritten by guaranty 
this controlled business also provides competition for our offices 
we also compete with issuers of alternatives to title insurance products  which typically provide more limited coverage and less service for a smaller fee 

table of contents title revenues by state 
the approximate amounts and percentages of consolidated title operating revenues for the last three years were amounts millions percentages california texas florida new york all others regulations 
title insurance companies are subject to comprehensive state regulations covering premium rates  agency licensing  policy forms  trade practices  reserve requirements  investments and the transfer of funds between an insurer and its parent or its subsidiaries and any similar related party transactions 
kickbacks and similar practices are prohibited by various state and federal laws 
real estate information the real estate information segment primarily provides electronic delivery of data  products and services related to real estate 
rei services related to the mortgage origination process include flood certificates  credit reports  traditional and automated property valuations  electronic mortgage documents  property information reports and tax services 
stewart mortgage information company smi  one of the segment companies  provides post closing outsourcing services for residential mortgage lenders  including document review  investor delivery  fha va insuring  document retrieval  preparation and recordation of assignments  lien releases and security interests  collateral reviews and loan pool certifications 
stewart default solutions  inc provides mortgage default management solutions to lenders 
in addition  other companies within the real estate information segment provide diverse products and services related to automated mapping projects and geodetic positioning  real estate database conversion  construction  maintenance and access  automation for government recording and registration  criminal  credit and motor vehicle background checks and pre employment screening services  and irc section tax deferred property exchanges 
the introduction of automation tools for title agencies is an important part of the future growth of the rei companies 
automated search and examination tools developed by ultima corporation and reidata  inc are designed to increase the processing speed of title examinations by connecting all aspects of the title examination process to the public records 
accessible through www 
propertyinfo 
com tm  a title examiner can utilize advanced search analysis and searchmanager tm to automate work flows for search  examination and production of title reports  thus eliminating the steps and inefficiencies associated with traditional courthouse searches 
also available through real estate portals owned and developed by stewart s rei companies are aerial photographs and maps offered by globexplorer and airphotousa 
factors affecting revenues 
as in the title segment  rei revenues  particularly those generated by mortgage information services and tax deferred exchanges  are closely related to the level of activity in the real estate market 
revenues related to many services are generated on a project basis 
contracts for automating government recording and registration and mapping projects are often awarded following competitive bidding processes or after responding to formal requests for proposals 
companies that compete with stewart s rei companies vary across a wide range of industries 
in the mortgage related products and services area  competitors include the major title insurance underwriters mentioned under title market share  as well as entities known as vendor management companies 
in some cases the competitor may be the customer itself 
for example  certain services offered by smi can be  or historically have been  performed by internal departments of large mortgage lenders 
another important factor affecting revenues is the advancement of technology  which permits customers to order and receive timely status reports and final products and services through dedicated interfaces with the customer s production systems or over the internet 
the use of websites  including www 
stewart 
com and www 
propertyinfo 
com  allows customers easy access to solutions designed for their specific industry

other customers include accountants  attorneys  investors and others seeking services for their respective clients in need of qualified intermediary section services and employers seeking pre employment information about prospective employees 
many of the services and products offered by the rei segment are used by professionals and intermediaries who have been retained to assist consumers with the sale  purchase  mortgage  transfer  recording and servicing of real estate related transactions 
to that end  timely and accurate services are critical to our customers since these factors directly affect the service they provide to their customers 
financial strength  marketplace presence and reputation as a technology innovator are important factors in attracting new business 
general technology 
our automation products and services are increasing productivity in the title office and speeding the real estate closing process for lenders  real estate professionals and consumers 
before automation  an order typically required several individuals to manually search the title  retrieve and review documents and create the title policy commitment 
today  on a normal subdivision file  and in some locations where our systems are optimally deployed  one person can receive the order electronically  view the prior file  examine the indexed documents  prepare the commitment and deliver the finished title insurance product 
we are deploying sureclose  an electronic document handler that gives consumers access to their closing file during the closing process  for more transparency of the transaction 
trademarks 
we have developed numerous automation products and processes that are crucial to both our title and rei segments 
these systems automate most facets of the real estate transaction 
among these trademarked products and processes are aim  airphotousa  e title  globexplorer  landata title office  reimall  sureclose  titlelogix and virtual underwriter 
we consider these trademarks  which are perpetual in duration  to be important to our business

item a 
risk factors you should consider the following risk factors  as well as the other information presented in this report and our other filings with the sec  in evaluating our business and any investment in our business 
these risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock could decline materially 

table of contents if adverse changes in the levels of real estate activity occur  our revenues will decline 
our results of operations and financial condition are affected by changes in economic conditions  particularly mortgage interest rates 
our revenues and earnings have fluctuated in the past and we expect them to fluctuate in the future 
the demand for our title insurance and real estate information services depends in large part on the volume of residential and commercial real estate transactions 
the volume of these transactions historically has been influenced by factors such as mortgage interest rates and the state of the overall economy 
typically  when interest rates are increasing or when the economy is experiencing a downturn  real estate activity declines 
as a result  the title insurance industry tends to experience decreased revenues and earnings 
increases in interest rates also may have an adverse impact on our bond portfolio and interest on our bank debt 
we have benefited from a low mortgage interest rate environment and an increase in home prices in recent years 
a reversal of these trends could adversely affect our revenues and earnings absent increases in market share  which cannot be assured 
competition in the title insurance industry affects our revenues 
competition in the title insurance industry is strong  particularly with respect to price  service and expertise 
larger commercial customers and mortgage originators also look to the size and financial strength of the title insurer 
although we are one of the leading title insurance underwriters based on market share  fidelity national financial  inc  the first american corporation and landamerica financial group  inc are each substantially larger than we are 
their holding companies have significantly greater capital than we do 
although we are not aware of any current initiatives to reduce regulatory barriers to entering our industry  any such reduction could result in new competitors  including financial institutions  entering the title insurance business 
competition among the major title insurance companies and any new entrants could lower our premium and fee revenues 
from time to time  new entrants enter the marketplace with alternative products to traditional title insurance although many of these alternative products have been disallowed by title insurance regulators 
these alternative products  if permitted by regulators  could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
rapid technological changes in our industry require timely and cost effective responses 
our earnings may be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively use technology to increase productivity 
technological advances occur rapidly in the title insurance industry as industry standards evolve and title insurers frequently introduce new products and services 
we believe that our future success depends on our ability to anticipate technological changes and to offer products and services that meet evolving standards on a timely and cost effective basis 
successful implementation and customer acceptance of our technology based services  such as sureclose  will be crucial to our future profitability  as will increasing our productivity to recover our costs of developing our technology based services 
there is a risk that products and services introduced by our competitors  or advances in technology  could reduce the usefulness of our products and render them obsolete 
our claims experience may require us to increase our provision for title losses or to record additional reserves  either of which would adversely affect our earnings 
estimating future loss payments is difficult  and our assumptions about future losses may prove inaccurate 
claims are often complex and involve uncertainties as to the dollar amount and timing of individual payments 
claims are often paid many years after a policy is issued 
from time to time  we experience large losses from title policies that have been issued  which require us to increase our title loss reserves 
these events are unpredictable and adversely affect our earnings 
our growth strategy will depend in part on our ability to acquire and integrate complementary businesses 
as part of our overall growth strategy  we selectively acquire businesses and technologies that will allow us to enter new markets  provide services that we currently do not offer or advance our existing technology 
our ability to continue this acquisition strategy will depend on our success in identifying and consummating acquisitions of businesses on favorable economic terms 
the success of this strategy will also depend on our ability to integrate the operations  products and personnel of any acquired business  retain key personnel  introduce new products and services on a timely basis and increase the strength of our existing management team 
although we actively seek acquisition candidates  we may be unsuccessful in these efforts 
if we are unable to acquire appropriate businesses on favorable economic terms  or at all  or are unable to introduce new products and services successfully  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

table of contents we rely on dividends from our insurance underwriting subsidiaries 
significant restrictions on dividends from our subsidiaries could adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions 
we are a holding company and our principal assets are the securities of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries 
because of this structure  we depend primarily on receiving sufficient dividends from our insurance subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations  to pay our operating expenses and to pay dividends 
the insurance statutes and regulations of some states require us to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital and restrict the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay to us 
guaranty is a wholly owned subsidiary of stewart and the principal source of our cash flow 
in this regard  the ability of guaranty to pay dividends to us is dependent on the acknowledgement of the texas insurance commissioner 
at december   under texas insurance law  guaranty could pay dividends or make distributions of up to million in without approval of the texas insurance commissioner 
however  guaranty voluntarily restricts dividends to us so that it can grow its statutory surplus and maintain liquidity at competitive levels 
a title insurer s ability to pay claims can significantly affect the decision of lenders and other customers when buying a policy from a particular insurer 
these restrictions could limit our ability to fund our acquisition program with cash and to fulfill other cash needs 
our insurance subsidiaries must comply with extensive government regulations 
these regulations could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues and operating results 
state authorities regulate our insurance subsidiaries in the various states in which they do business 
these regulations generally are intended for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders 
the nature and extent of these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  but typically involve approval or setting of insurance premium rates  standards of solvency and minimum amounts of statutory capital and surplus that must be maintained  limitations on types and amounts of investments  establishing reserves  including statutory premium reserves  for losses and loss adjustment expenses  regulation of dividend payments and other transactions among affiliates  prior approval of the acquisition and control of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company  licensing of insurers and agencies  regulation of reinsurance  restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured by a single company  regulation of underwriting and marketing practices  deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders  approval of policy forms  methods of accounting  and filing of annual and other reports with respect to financial condition and other matters 
these regulations may impede or impose burdensome conditions on rate increases or other actions that we might want to take to enhance our operating results 
changes in these regulations may also adversely affect us 
in addition  state regulatory examiners perform periodic examinations of insurance companies  which could result in increased compliance or litigation expenses 
litigation risks include claims by large classes of claimants 
we are periodically involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
in addition  we are currently  and have been in the past  subject to claims and litigation from large classes of claimants seeking substantial damages not arising in the ordinary course of business 
material pending legal proceedings  if any  not in the ordinary course of business  are disclosed in item legal proceedings included elsewhere in this report 
to date  the impact of the outcome of these proceedings has not been material to our results of operations or financial position 
however  an unfavorable outcome in any litigation  claim or investigation against us could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws may make a takeover of us difficult 
this may reduce the opportunity for our stockholders to obtain a takeover premium for their shares of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws  as well as delaware corporation law and the insurance laws of various states  all contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer for our shares  or that may otherwise delay  defer or prevent a change in control of stewart 

table of contents the holders of our class b common stock have the right to elect four of our nine directors 
pursuant to our by laws  the vote of six directors is required to constitute an act by the board of directors 
accordingly  the affirmative vote of at least one of the directors elected by the holders of the class b common stock is required for any action to be taken by the board of directors 
the foregoing provision of our by laws may not be amended or repealed without the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of each class of our capital stock  voting as separate classes 
the voting rights of the holders of our class b common stock may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging unsolicited tender offers  merger proposals  proxy contests or other takeover proposals to acquire control of stewart 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we lease approximately  square feet  under a non cancelable lease expiring in  in an office building in houston  texas  which is used for our corporate offices and for offices of several of our subsidiaries 
in addition  we lease offices at approximately additional locations that are used for branch offices  regional headquarters and technology centers 
these additional locations include significant leased facilities in los angeles  dallas  san diego  seattle and las vegas 
our leases expire from to and have an average term of four years  although our typical lease term ranges from three to five years 
we believe we will not have any difficulty obtaining renewals of leases as they expire or  alternatively  leasing comparable properties 
the aggregate annual rent expense under all leases was approximately  in we also own six office buildings located in texas  arizona and colorado 
these owned properties are not material to our financial position 
we consider all buildings and equipment that we own or lease to be well maintained  adequately insured and generally sufficient for our purposes 
item legal proceedings as first reported in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december   stewart title insurance company stic  an underwriter subsidiary of the company  was a defendant in a new york state class action lawsuit in the supreme court state of new york 
the lawsuit alleged that stic directly and through its agencies routinely collected excess premiums in connection with refinance transactions 
similar actions were brought against seven other unrelated underwriters 
stic denied culpability on a number of grounds 
in february  stic reached a settlement with the plaintiffs  which was approved by the court and which fully and finally resolved all purposed claims of the plaintiffs 
at december   the company had a reserve of million for this claim  which was sufficient to cover the payment of the final settlement in the third quarter of and other expenses associated with this lawsuit 
we are a party to routine lawsuits incidental to our business  most of which involve disputed policy claims 
in many of these suits  the plaintiffs seek exemplary or treble damages in excess of policy limits based on the alleged malfeasance of an issuing agent 
we do not expect that any of these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition 
additionally  we have received various inquiries from governmental regulators concerning practices in the insurance industry 
many of these practices do not concern title insurance and we do not anticipate that the outcome of these inquiries will materially affect the consolidated financial condition of the company 
we  along with the other major title insurance companies  are party to a number of class actions concerning the title insurance industry 
we believe that we have adequate reserves for these contingencies and that the likely resolution of these matters will not materially affect the consolidated financial condition of the company 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders none

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s overview 
we reported net earnings of million for the year ended december  compared with net earnings of million for the same period in on a diluted per share basis  net earnings were for the year compared with net earnings of for the year revenues for the year increased to  million from  million last year 
in comparing with  pretax earnings which is calculated before minority interests were increased by a higher level of commercial transactions and a higher mix of revenues from direct operations compared with lower margin agency business 
acquisitions increased revenues by million and pretax earnings by million in earnings for were impacted by higher employee costs and other operating expenses primarily because the company continues to incur the costs of investment in technology advancements 
the company s goal is to increase productivity  gain market share and provide superior service to its customers 
profits in were also impacted by an addition to title loss reserves of million in the fourth quarter of relating to a mortgage fraud and a defalcation 
the fourth quarter of also includes charges relating to corrections of the company s accounting for leases and employee vacations of million and million  respectively 
the combined after tax effect of these two items was million  which is immaterial for the year to net earnings  cash flow and stockholders equity 
critical accounting estimates 
actual results can differ from the accounting estimates we report 
however  we believe there is no material risk of a change in our estimates that is likely to have a material impact on our reported financial condition or results of operations for the three years ended december  title loss reserves our most critical accounting estimate is providing for title loss reserves 
our liability for estimated title losses at december  comprises both known claims million and claims expected to be reported in the future million 
the amount of the reserve represents the aggregate future payments  net of recoveries  that we expect to incur on policy and escrow losses and in costs to settle claims 
we base our estimates on reported claims  historical loss experience  title industry averages and the current legal and economic environment 
in making estimates  we use moving average ratios of recent actual policy loss payment experience net of recoveries to premium revenues 
provisions for title losses  as a percentage of title operating revenues  were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
actual loss payment experience  including the impact of large losses  is the primary reason for increases or decreases in our loss provision 
a change of in this percentage  a reasonably likely scenario based on historical loss experience  would have changed the provision for title losses and pretax earnings by approximately million for the year ended december  estimating future loss payments is difficult and our assumptions are subject to the risk of change 
claims  by their very nature  are complex and involve uncertainties as to the dollar amount and timing of individual payments 
our experience has been that most claims against policies and claim payments are made in the first six years after the policy has been issued  although claims are incurred and paid many years later 
we have consistently followed the same basic method of estimating loss payments for more than ten years 
independent consulting actuaries have reviewed our title loss reserves and found them to be adequate at each year end for more than ten years 
goodwill and other long lived assets based on our annual june th evaluation of goodwill and events that may indicate impairment of title plants and other long lived assets  we estimate and expense any loss in value to our current operations 
the process of determining impairment relies on projections of future cash flows  operating results and market conditions 
uncertainties exist in these projections and bear the risk of change related to factors such as interest rates and overall real estate markets 
actual market conditions and operating results may vary materially from our projections 
there were no impairment write offs of goodwill during the years ended december  and during  million of goodwill attributed to a subsidiary held for sale was written off and is included in other operating expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
we use independent appraisers to assist us in determining the fair value of our reporting units and assessing whether an impairment of goodwill exists 

table of contents agency revenues we recognize revenues on title insurance policies written by independent title agencies agencies when the policies are reported to us 
in addition  where reasonable estimates can be made  we also accrue for policies issued but not reported until after period end 
we believe that reasonable estimates can be made when recent and consistent policy issuance information is available 
our estimates are based on historical reporting patterns and other information about our agencies 
we also consider current trends in our direct operations and in the title industry 
in this accrual  we are not estimating future transactions 
we are estimating policies that have already been issued but not yet received by us 
we have consistently followed the same basic method of estimating unreported policy revenues for more than ten years 
our accruals for unreported policies from agencies were not material to our total assets or stockholders equity for any of the three years ended december  the differences between the amounts our agencies have subsequently reported to us as compared to our estimated accruals are substantially offset by any difference arising from the prior year s accrual and have been immaterial to stockholders equity during each of the three prior years 
we believe our process provides the most reliable estimation of the unreported policies and appropriately reflects the trends in agency policy activity 
operations 
our business has two main segments title insurance related services and real estate information rei 
these segments are closely related due to the nature of their operations and common customers 
our primary business is title insurance and settlement related services 
we close transactions and issue title policies on homes  commercial properties and other real property located in all states  the district of columbia and a number of international markets through more than  policy issuing offices and agencies 
we also provide post closing lender services  mortgage default management services  automated county clerk land records  property ownership mapping  geographic information systems  property information reports  flood certificates  document preparation  background checks and expertise in tax deferred exchanges 
our current levels of international operations are immaterial with respect to our consolidated financial results 
factors affecting revenues 
the principal factors that contribute to increases in our operating revenues for our title and rei segments include declining mortgage interest rates  which usually increase home sales and refinancing transactions  rising home prices  increasing consumer confidence  increasing demand by buyers  increasing number of households  higher premium rates  increasing market share  opening of new offices and acquisitions  and increasing number of commercial transactions that typically yield higher premiums 
to the extent inflation causes increases in the prices of homes and other real estate  premium revenues are also increased 
premiums are determined in part by the insured values of the transactions we handle 
these factors may override the seasonal nature of the title business 
generally  our first quarter is the least active and the fourth quarter is the most active in terms of title revenues 

table of contents industry data 
a table of published mortgage interest rates and other selected residential data for the years ended december   and follows amounts shown for are preliminary and subject to revision 
the amounts below may not relate directly to or provide accurate data for forecasting our operating revenues or order counts 
mortgage rates year  fixed rate average for the year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter mortgage originations in billions refinancings share new home sales in thousands existing home sales in thousands existing home sales median sales price in thousands most industry experts project mortgage interest rates to rise modestly in due to the large number of refinancings completed in  and and rising interest rates  significantly fewer refinancing transactions are being forecast for trends and order counts 
in the third quarter of mortgage interest rates increased significantly by basis points to 
since that time  mortgage interest rates have fluctuated from to a high of in the fourth quarter of mortgage originations fell to lower levels beginning in the fourth quarter of primarily because refinancing transactions fell dramatically 
mortgage originations continued to fall substantially during  although there was a slight increase in sales of new and existing homes continued an upward trend throughout and as a result of the above trends  the company s order levels began to decline in the third quarter of they remained below prior year levels through august for the rest of  orders exceeded the number of orders received in order levels for remained relatively comparable to  although orders for the fourth quarter of were lower than the comparable period in some of the increases in and were due to acquisitions 
our order counts follow in thousands first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter results of operations a comparison of the results of operations of the company for with and with follows 
factors contributing to fluctuations in results of operations are presented in their order of monetary significance 
we have quantified  when necessary  significant changes 
title revenues 
our revenues from direct title operations increased in and decreased in acquisitions added revenues of million and million in and  respectively 
the number of direct closings we handled increased in and decreased in the largest revenue increases in were in texas  florida  california and arizona 
the largest decreases in were in texas  colorado and illinois  partially offset by increases in new york  canada  california and puerto rico 
the average revenue per closing increased in and in primarily due to a lower ratio of refinancings closed by our direct operations compared to the prior year 
title insurance premiums on refinancings are typically less than on property sales 
the increase in in average revenue per closing was also due to an increased proportion of commercial transactions and rising home prices 

table of contents revenues from agencies increased in and decreased in the increase in was primarily due to a decrease in the ratio of refinancing transactions compared to property sales  partially offset by our acquisitions of some agencies that were formerly independent 
the decrease in was primarily due to an overall decrease in the volume of transactions completed and a decrease in refinancing transactions offset somewhat by an increase in property sales 
we are unable to quantify the relative contributions from refinancings and property sales because  in most jurisdictions  our independent agencies are not required to report this information 
our statements on sales and refinancings are based on published industry data from sources such as fannie mae  the mortgage bankers association  the national association of realtors and freddie mac 
we also use information from our direct operations 
the largest increases in revenues from agencies in were primarily in florida  new jersey  georgia and maryland  offset partially by decreases in california and texas 
the largest decreases in in revenues from agencies were primarily in california  utah  new york and michigan  offset partially by increases in virginia  florida and pennsylvania 
the texas department of insurance reduced title insurance premium rates by effective july  as a consequence  our revenues and net earnings were reduced by approximately million and million  respectively  in and million and million  respectively  in title revenues by state 
the approximate amounts and percentages of consolidated title operating revenues for the last three years were as follows amounts millions percentages california texas florida new york all others rei revenues 
real estate information revenues were million in  million in and million in the increase in resulted primarily from a greater number of section property exchanges and increases in automated mapping services  partially offset by reduced revenues relating to post closing services and electronic mortgage documents 
the decrease in resulted primarily from a lesser amount of post closing services and electronic mortgage documents resulting from a reduction in the volume of real estate transactions  offset somewhat by an increase in section tax deferred property exchange services 
investments 
investment income increased in because of an increase in average balances invested and higher yields 
investment income increased in because of increases in average balances invested  partially offset by lower yields 
certain investment gains in  and were realized as part of the ongoing management of the investment portfolio for the purpose of improving performance 
retention by agencies 
the amounts retained by agencies  as a percentage of revenues generated by them  were  and in the years  and  respectively 
amounts retained by title agencies are based on agreements between agencies and our title underwriters 
the percentage that amounts retained by agencies bears to agency revenues may vary from year to year because of the geographical mix of agency operations and the volume of title revenues 
selected cost ratios by segment 
the following table shows employee costs and other operating expenses as a percentage of related title and rei operating revenues 
employee costs other operating title rei these two categories of expenses are discussed below in terms of year to year monetary changes 
employee costs 
employee costs for the combined business segments increased in and in the number of persons we employed at december   and was approximately   and  respectively 
the increases in staff in and were primarily due to and employees  and million and million in employee costs  from acquisitions  respectively 
the number of employees and employee costs also increased in due to the increase in the volume of real estate transactions closed by us 

table of contents in our rei segment  employee costs increased in these employee costs did not increase proportionately with the increase in revenues due to an increase in revenues from section property exchanges  which are less labor intensive than other rei services 
in employee costs were comparable to other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for the combined business segments increased in and in the increase in other operating expenses in was partially due to acquisitions  which contributed approximately million of the increase 
other increases included rent of million  certain rei expenses  business promotion and technology costs 
increases in were in acquisitions  which contributed million of the increase  litigation costs of million  rent and technology costs 
the increases were partially offset by decreases in certain rei expenses in response to volume decreases  supplies expense and attorney fees 
other operating expenses also include title plant and travel expenses 
most of our operating expenses follow  to varying degrees  the changes in transaction volume and revenues 
our employee costs and certain other operating expenses are sensitive to inflation 
to the extent inflation causes increases in the prices of homes and other real estate  premium revenues also increase 
premiums are determined in part by the insured values of the transactions we handle 
title losses 
provisions for title losses  as a percentage of title operating revenues  were  and in  and  respectively 
an increase in the number of larger losses resulted in an increase in our loss ratio in the increase included a million addition to title loss reserves in the fourth quarter of related to a mortgage fraud and a defalcation 
an increase in loss payment experience for prior policy years also resulted in an increase in our loss ratios in and income taxes 
the provisions for federal  state and foreign income taxes represented effective tax rates of  and in  and  respectively 
contractual obligations 
our material contractual obligations at december  were payments due millions less than more than year years years years total notes payable operating leases estimated title losses material contractual obligations consist primarily of notes payable  operating leases and estimated title losses 
operating leases are primarily for office space and expire over the next years 
the timing for the payment of estimated title losses is not set by contract 
rather  it is projected based on historical payment patterns 
the actual timing of estimated title loss payments may vary materially from the above projection because claims  by their nature  are complex and paid over long periods of time 
loss reserves represent a total estimate only  whereas the other contractual obligations are determinable as to timing and amounts 
title losses paid were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash flow from operations has been the primary source of financing for additions to property and equipment  expanding operations  dividends to stockholders and other requirements 
this source is supplemented by bank borrowings 
the most significant non operating source of cash was from proceeds of investments matured and sold in the amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we used cash for the purchases of investments in the amounts of million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents acquisitions during  and resulted in additions to goodwill of million  million and million  respectively 
restrictions on liquidity 
a substantial majority of our consolidated cash and investments at december  was held by stewart title guaranty company guaranty and its subsidiaries 
the use and investment of these funds  dividends to the company and cash transfers between guaranty and its subsidiaries and the company are subject to certain legal restrictions notes and 
our liquidity at december   excluding guaranty and its subsidiaries  was comprised of cash and investments aggregating million and short term liabilities of million 
we know of no commitments or uncertainties that are likely to materially affect our ability to fund cash needs note 
loss reserves 
our loss reserves are fully funded  segregated and invested in high quality securities and short term investments 
this is required by the insurance regulators of the states in which our underwriters are domiciled 
at december   these investments aggregated million and our estimated title loss reserves were million 
effective september  and retroactive to the start of the year  the texas legislature reduced statutory reserve requirements for our major title insurer 
the change does not directly impact reported earnings or loss reserves under us generally accepted accounting principles 
however  the change released approximately million  or approximately million after tax  of low yielding statutory reserve investments making that portion available for other uses 
historically  our operating cash flow has been sufficient to pay all title policy losses incurred 
as reported in note  the market value of our debt securities maturing in less than one year was million at december  combined with our annual cash flow from operations million in  we do not expect future loss payments to create a liquidity problem for us 
beyond providing funds for losses  we manage the maturities of our investment portfolio to provide safety of capital  improve earnings and mitigate interest rate risks 
capital resources 
we consider our capital resources to be adequate 
we expect external capital resources will be available  if needed  because of our low debt to equity ratio 
long term debt was million and stockholders equity was million at december  we are not aware of any trends  either favorable or unfavorable  that will materially affect notes payable or stockholders equity 
we do not expect any material changes in the cost of such resources 
significant acquisitions in the future could materially affect the notes payable or stockholders equity balances 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any material source of liquidity or financing that involves off balance sheet arrangements 
forward looking statements 
all statements included in this report  other than statements of historical facts  addressing activities  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future  are forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties including  among other things  adverse changes in the levels of real estate activity  technology changes  unanticipated title losses  adverse changes in governmental regulations  actions of competitors  general economic conditions and other risks and uncertainties discussed under item a risk factors included elsewhere in this report

management s projections of hypothetical net losses in the fair value of our market rate sensitive financial instruments  should certain potential changes in market rates occur  are presented below 
while we believe that the potential market rate changes are possible  actual rate changes could differ 
our only material market risk in investments in financial instruments is our debt securities portfolio 
we invest primarily in marketable municipal  corporate  foreign  us government and mortgage backed debt securities 
we do not invest in financial instruments of a hedging or derivative nature 
we have established policies and procedures to minimize our exposure to changes in the fair values of our investments 
these policies include retaining an investment advisory firm  an emphasis upon credit quality  management of portfolio duration  maintaining or increasing investment income through high coupon rates and actively managing profile and security mix depending upon market conditions 
we have classified all of our investments as available for sale 
investments in debt securities at december  mature  according to their contractual terms  as follows actual maturities may differ because of call or prepayment rights amortized market costs values thousands in one year or less after one year through two years after two years through three years after three years through four years after four years through five years after five years mortgage backed securities we believe our investment portfolio is diversified and do not expect any material loss to result from the failure to perform by issuers of the debt securities we hold 
our investments are not collateralized 
the mortgage backed securities are issued by us government sponsored entities 
based on our debt securities portfolio and interest rates at december   a basis point increase decrease in interest rates would result in a decrease increase of approximately million  or  in the fair value of our portfolio 
changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the debt securities portfolio and may result in unrealized gains or losses 
gains or losses would only be realized upon the sale of the investments 
any other than temporary declines in market values of securities are charged to earnings
