item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
due to the impact of weakened market conditions and competitive pressures affecting our european distribution business  and in earlier years  the downturn in the electronic component  computer product industry and in the global economy as a whole  we have recorded charges that are discussed more fully in restructuring costs and other charges in this md a 
these charges have had a significant impact on our results of operations for the years ended december  and presented in this form k as discussed further below 
when used in this report  the words expects  anticipates  estimates  intends and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of section a under the securities act of and section e under the securities exchange act of such statements include but are not limited to statements regarding our ability to obtain favorable product allocations  the annual employee expense and cost reductions related to our european restructuring  the timing of when certain restructuring and special charges liabilities will be extinguished  our plans related to the payment of dividends  our future cash requirements and our ability to increase gross profit while controlling expenses 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially  including those risks described under risk factors in item hereof 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting polices as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes our most critical accounting policies relate to the following areas revenue recognition bell s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
the provision for estimated returns is recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue based on historical sales returns and analysis of credit memorandum data 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and at december  it was million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in  our bad debt expense was million compared to million in vendor programs we receive funds from vendors for price protection  product rebates  marketing and promotions  infrastructure reimbursement and competitive pricing programs 
amounts related to price protection and other incentive programs are recorded as adjustments to inventories  cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the program 
vendor receivables are generally collected through vendor authorized reductions to our accounts payable 
there is a time delay between the submission of a claim by us and confirmation of agreement by our vendors 
historically  our estimated claims have approximated amounts agreed to by our vendors 
valuation of inventory inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
our inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  selling prices and market conditions 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded inventory charges of million related to excess inventory on hand 
these additional write downs resulted from our decision to exit certain unprofitable business lines in europe 
these charges were included in the statement of operations within the caption cost of sales 
we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account our contractual provisions with our suppliers governing price protection  stock rotation and return privileges relating to obsolescence 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
special and acquisition related charges we have been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  change in control expenses  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill 
actual amounts incurred could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net foreign operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  we consider historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  a valuation allowance is recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
in  we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at december   goodwill amounted to million and identifiable intangible assets amounted to million 
we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate a possible impairment of goodwill 
in determining whether there is an impairment of goodwill  we calculate the estimated fair value of our company based on the closing sales price of our common stock and projected discounted cash flows as of the date we perform the impairment tests 
we then compare the resulting fair value to our respective net book value  including goodwill 
if the net book value of our company exceeds its fair value  we measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of our goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of our goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognize a goodwill impairment loss 
we perform this impairment test annually and whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there is a possible impairment of goodwill 
we completed the required annual impairment test  which resulted in no impairment for fiscal year we believe the methodology we use in testing impairment of goodwill provides us with a reasonable basis in determining whether an impairment charge should be taken 
hedge accounting we generate a substantial portion of our revenues in international markets  which subjects our operations and cash flows to the exposure of currency exchange fluctuations 
we seek to minimize the risk associated with currency exchange fluctuations by entering into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities 
these derivatives do not qualify for sfas hedge accounting treatment 
accordingly  changes in the fair value of these hedges are recorded immediately in earnings on line item interest expense and other income to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged 
results of operations executive summary for both the year overall and the fourth quarter we achieved record revenues 
revenues for the fourth quarter of reached a record million  increasing compared to last year s fourth quarter revenues  and revenues for the year reached a record billion  increasing over we had strong performance in sales and operating profit performance in north and latin america as well as our enterprise business units  but performed below expectation in our european distribution business 
although our overall european sales grew in from the prior year  the growth was primarily driven by our openpsl enterprise business  which continues to be profitable  and the year end benefit of our recent acquisition of mce 
our primary focus in our european distribution business during the fourth quarter was to ensure that we drove substantial cost reduction actions and repositioned these operations 
we implemented a restructuring plan and made significant progress in this area through reductions in personnel and other expenses as further described below 
we are currently implementing the next phase of our european plan  which is to drive revenue and margin in the industrial market segments and we are confident that these actions will contribute to improved results and a differentiated business model in europe

selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or

the increase in interest expense and other income was primarily due to overall increased bank borrowings during for worldwide working capital purposes and the acquisition of net storage 
the average interest rate in was versus in in  we recorded an effective tax rate of on income before taxes compared to an effective tax rate of in the change in the tax rate was primarily related to the losses incurred in certain of our european jurisdictions  primarily as a result of our restructuring plan  that we could not offset against profits we earned in north america and latin america

also in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a special charge due to a terminated components supply program in north america and provided a specific reserve for a partner account receivable balance that we believe may not be collectable as a result of the program termination 
this amount has been classified as a special charge in the amount of million  net of a  reversal of restructuring costs and special charges taken in prior years that were adjusted to reflect actual charges 
outstanding restructuring liabilities related to the charges expected to be paid in cash are summarized as follows in thousands balance at restructuring exchange balance beginning reserve cash rate at end year ended december  of period restructuring release payments changes of period severance costs   lease costs   total     severance costs lease costs  total  severance costs   lease costs   total   management expects to extinguish the restructuring and special charges liabilities of million by december year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales were  million for the year ended december   which represented an increase of million  or over the sales increase was driven by an increase of million in solutions sales as well as an increase of million in sales of components and peripherals

the average interest rate in was versus in in  we recorded an effective tax rate of on the income before taxes compared to an effective tax benefit rate of on losses before taxes for the change in the tax rate was primarily related to the shift to profitability in compared to a loss in and also related to the jurisdictions in which the profits were earned 
the tax benefit rate for the loss was primarily driven by deferred tax valuation allowances established related to losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions 
restructuring costs and special charges in the second quarter of  we were released from certain contractual obligations related to excess facilities in the us for which restructuring charges had been recorded in accordingly  we released approximately  of our restructuring reserve related to that facility 
additionally  we revised our estimates for future lease obligations for non cancelable lease payments for excess facilities in europe and recorded an additional  of restructuring charges

we anticipate that our existing cash and our ability to borrow under our lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for operations and capital requirements through december  our expectations as to cash flows  and as to future cash balances  are subject to a number of assumptions  including assumptions regarding anticipated revenues  customer purchasing and payment patterns  and improvements in general economic conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
if revenues do not match projections and if losses exceed our expectations  we will implement cost saving initiatives 
if we are unable to sustain our profitability  in order to continue operations  we may need to obtain additional debt financing or sell additional shares of our equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by sfas no 
are intended to improve financial reporting by clarifying that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and by requiring the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r revised  share based payment 
sfas r is a revision of fasb and supersedes apb no 
sfas r establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services or incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair market value of the entity s equity instruments 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair market value of the award over the period during which an employee is required to provide service for the award 
the grant date fair market value of employee share options and similar instruments must be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments unless observable market prices for the same or similar instruments are available 
in addition  sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of liability instruments based on its current fair market value and that the fair market value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
the effective date of sfas r for our company is for the first annual period beginning after june   ie fiscal year ended december  adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as we will be required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan rather than disclose the impact on our consolidated net income within our footnotes  as is our current practice see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate credit facilities and could be subjected to increased interest payments if market interest rates fluctuate 
for the year ended december   average borrowings outstanding on the variable rate credit facilities include million with congress financial  million with wachovia bank  national association and pnc bank  national association  million with bank of america  na  million with ibm and  with the ifn 
these facilities have interest rates that are based on associated rates such as eurodollar and base or prime rates that may fluctuate over time based on changes in the economic environment 
based on actual borrowings throughout the year under these borrowing facilities  an increase of in such interest rate percentages would increase the annual interest expense by approximately million 
a substantial part of our revenue and capital expenditures are transacted in us dollars  but the functional currency for foreign subsidiaries is not the us dollar 
we enter into foreign forward exchange contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
the gains and losses on the forward exchange contracts are largely offset by gains or losses on the underlying transactions and  consequently  a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates should not have a material impact on future net income or cash flows 
as a result of bell or its subsidiaries entering into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency  bell recognized a foreign currency loss of million during the year ended december  to the extent we are unable to manage these risks  our results  financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
in august  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in order to gain access to the lower borrowing rates normally available on floating rate debt  while avoiding prepayment and other costs that would be associated with refinancing long term fixed rate debt 
the swap purchased has a notional amount of million  expiring in june  with a six month settlement period and provides for variable interest at libor plus a set rate spread 
the notional amount is amortized ratably as the underlying debt is repaid 
the notional amount at december  was million 
the notional amount does not quantify risk or represent assets or liabilities  but rather  is used in the determination of cash settlement under the swap agreement 
as a result of purchasing this swap  we will be exposed to credit losses from counter party non performance  however  we do not anticipate any such losses from this agreement  which is with a major financial institution 
the agreement will also expose us to interest rate risk should libor rise during the term of the agreement 
this swap agreement is accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
under the provisions of sfas  we initially recorded the interest rate swap at fair value  and subsequently recorded any changes in fair value as an offset to the related liability 
fair value is determined based on quoted market prices  which reflect the difference between estimated future variable rate payments and future fixed rate receipts 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was million at december
