we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
for more information regarding our critical accounting policies  please see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
long lived assets investments in real estate properties are recorded at cost 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase method 
the cost of the properties acquired is allocated among tangible land  buildings and equipment and recognized intangibles based upon estimated fair values in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
we estimate fair values of the components of assets acquired as of the acquisition date or engage a third party appraiser as necessary 
recognized intangibles  if any  include the value of acquired lease contracts and related customer relationships 
our method for determining fair value varies with the categorization of the asset acquired 
we estimate the fair value of buildings on an as if vacant basis  and depreciate the building value over the estimated remaining life of the building 
we determine the allocated value of other fixed assets based upon the replacement cost and depreciate such value over their estimated remaining useful lives 
we determine the value of land either based on real estate tax assessed values in relation to the total value of the asset  internal analyses of recently acquired and existing comparable properties within our portfolio or third party appraisals 
the fair value of in place leases  if any  reflects i above and below market leases  if any  determined by discounting the difference between the estimated current market rent and the in place rentals  the resulting intangible asset of which is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining life of the associated lease plus any fixed rate renewal periods  if applicable  ii the estimated value of the cost to obtain tenants  including tenant allowances  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease  and iii an estimated value of the absorption period to reflect the value of the rents and recovery costs foregone during a reasonable lease up period  as if the acquired space was vacant  which is amortized over the remaining life of the associated lease 
we also estimate the value of tenant or other customer relationships acquired by considering the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with such tenant  such tenant s credit quality  expectations of lease renewals with such tenant  and the potential for significant  additional future leasing arrangements with such tenant 
we amortize such value  if any  over the expected term of the associated arrangements or leases  which would include the remaining lives of the related leases and any expected renewal periods 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate our long lived assets  primarily consisting of our investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying operations and adjust the net book value of leased properties and other long lived assets to fair value if the sum of the expected future cash flow or sales proceeds is less than book value 
an impairment loss is recognized at the time we make any such adjustment 
future events could occur which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
loans and other amounts receivable from third parties we evaluate the collectibility of loans and other amounts receivable from third parties based on a number of factors including  i corporate and facility level financial and operations reports  ii compliance with the financial covenants set for the in the borrowing or lease agreement  iii the financial stability of the applicable borrow or tenant and any guarantor and iv the payment history of the borrower or tenant 
our level of reserves  if any  for loans and other amounts receivable from third parties fluctuates depending upon all of the factors previously mentioned 

table of contents revenue recognition certain of our leases  excluding our master lease agreements the kindred master leases with kindred healthcare  inc and certain of its affiliates collectively  kindred  provide for periodic and determinable increases in base rent 
base rental revenues under these leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
certain of our other leases  including the kindred master leases  provide for an annual increase in rental payments only if certain revenue parameters or other contingencies are met 
we recognize the increased rental revenue under these leases only if the revenue parameters or other contingencies are met rather than on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable lease 
we recognize income from rent  lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with securities and exchange commission the commission staff accounting bulletin i the agreement has been fully executed and delivered  ii services have been rendered  iii the amount is fixed or determinable  and iv the collectibility is reasonably assured 
fair value of derivative instruments the valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
fair values for our derivatives are verified with a third party consultant 
such amounts and the recognition of such amounts in the financial statements are subject to significant estimates which may change in the future

funds from operations our funds from operations ffo for the five years ended december  are summarized in the following table for the year ended december  in thousands net income adjustments depreciation on real estate assets loss gain on real estate disposals other items discontinued operations real estate depreciation discontinued gain on sale of real estate funds from operations historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
to overcome this problem  we consider ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit  and we use the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of ffo 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property  plus real estate depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definition 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is ffo necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs 
we believe that in 
table of contents order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and data included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
asset liability management asset liability management is a key element of our overall risk management program 
the objective of asset liability management is to support the achievement of business strategies while maintaining appropriate risk levels 
the asset liability management process focuses on a variety of risks  including market risk primarily interest rate risk and credit risk 
effective management of these risks is an important determinant of the absolute levels and variability of ffo and net worth 
the following discussion addresses our integrated management of assets and liabilities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
market risk we receive revenue primarily by leasing our assets under long term triple net leases in which the rental rate is generally fixed with annual escalators  subject to certain limitations 
we also earn revenue from our mortgage loans 
our obligations under our revolving credit facility are floating rate obligations whose interest rate and related monthly interest payments vary with the movement in libor 
the general fixed nature of our assets and the variable nature of our obligations create interest rate risk 
if interest rates were to rise significantly  our lease and other revenue might not be sufficient to meet our debt obligations 
in order to mitigate this risk  in september  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of million to hedge floating rate debt for the period between july  and june  the swap 
the swap is treated as a cash flow hedge for accounting purposes and is with a highly rated counterparty on which we pay a fixed rate of percent and receive libor from the counterparty 
in december  due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances as a result of the sale of ten facilities  we reduced the notional amount of the swap for the period from december  through june  from million to million 
in december  due to our lower expected future variable rate debt balances as a result of our payoff of the cmbs loan  we further reduced the notional amount of the swap to million for the remaining term of the swap 
see note borrowing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
there are no collateral requirements under the swap 
as of december   the notional amount of the swap was million  which is scheduled to expire on june  to highlight the sensitivity of the swap and our fixed rate debt to changes in interest rates  the following summary shows the effects of a hypothetical instantaneous change of basis points bps in interest rates as of december  and as of december  swap fixed rate debt swap fixed rate debt in thousands notional amount  n a  n a book value n a  n a  fair value fair value reflecting change in interest rates bps bps the change in fair value of the swap was due to the reduction of notional amount in december and a general increase in interest rates 
the change in fair value of fixed rate debt was due to the issuance of approximately million of fixed rate senior notes and the assumption of approximately million of fixed rate debt as a result of our acquisitions during the year ended december   partially offset by a general increase in interest rates 
n a not applicable 

table of contents we paid million under the swap during the year ended december  assuming that interest rates do not change  we estimate that we will pay approximately million on the swap during the year ending december  we had approximately million and million of variable rate debt outstanding as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease in our outstanding variable rate debt from december  is primarily attributable to the refinancing of our cmbs loan with fixed rate senior notes  offset by additional mortgages assumed in connection with the provident acquisition 
the swap currently effectively hedges million of our outstanding variable rate debt 
any amounts of variable rate debt in excess of million are subject to interest rate changes 
however  pursuant to the terms of certain leases with one of our tenants  if interest rates increase on certain debt that we have totaling million as of december   our tenant is required to pay us additional rent on a dollar for dollar basis in an amount equal to the increase in interest expense resulting from the increased interest rates 
therefore  the increase in interest expense related to this debt is equally offset by an increase in additional rent due to us from the tenant 
as of december   there was minimal cash flow impact from the fluctuation of interest rates on variable rate debt since we effectively hedged nearly all of our variable rate debt 
the fair value of our fixed and variable rate debt is based on current interest rates at which similar borrowings could be made by us 
we may engage in additional hedging strategies in the future  depending on management s analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies 
our market risk sensitive instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
credit risk as a result of our spin off of kindred in may and the provident acquisition in june  we have a significant concentration of credit risk with kindred and brookdale senior living inc together with its subsidiaries  brookdale senior living 
for the years ended december  and  kindred accounted for million  or percent of our total revenues  and million  or percent of our total revenues  respectively  and brookdale senior living accounted for million  or percent of our total revenues  for the year ended december  accordingly  the financial condition of kindred and brookdale senior living and their ability to meet our rent obligations will largely determine our rental revenues and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in addition  any failure by kindred or brookdale senior living to effectively conduct its operations could have a material adverse effect on its business reputation or on its ability to enlist and maintain patients in its facilities 
see risk factors risks arising from our business we are dependent on kindred and brookdale senior living  kindred s or brookdale senior living s inability or unwillingness to satisfy its obligations under its agreements with us could significantly harm us and our ability to service our indebtedness and other obligations and to make distributions to our stockholders as required to continue to qualify as a reit included in part i  item a of this annual report on form k and note concentration of credit risk of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we monitor our credit risk under our lease agreements with our tenants by  among other things  i reviewing and analyzing information regarding the healthcare industry generally  publicly available information regarding tenants  and information provided by the tenants and borrowers under our lease and other agreements  and ii having periodic discussions with tenants  borrowers and their representatives 
liquidity and capital resources during  our principal sources of liquidity were proceeds from equity and debt issuances  cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  disposition of real estate assets  proceeds from stock option exercises  and proceeds from the distribution reinvestment and stock purchase plan 
we anticipate that cash flow from operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations  dividends to stockholders and debt amortization 
capital requirements for acquisitions may require funding from borrowings  assumption of debt from the seller  issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities or equity offerings 

table of contents we intend to continue to fund future investments through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  disposition of assets and issuance of secured or unsecured long term debt or other securities 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  escrow deposits and restricted cash of million  and unused availability of million under our revolving credit facility 
cmbs transaction in december  we raised million in gross proceeds from the completion of the cmbs transaction 
in december  we repaid all of our outstanding indebtedness under the cmbs loan in the outstanding principal amount of million at the payoff date with the net proceeds from our sale of the senior notes as defined below and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
revolving credit facility in september  we entered into a new million revolving credit facility that replaced our previous revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at libor plus a percentage ranging from percent to percent  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
as of december   borrowings under the revolving credit facility bore interest at libor plus percent  resulting in a borrowing rate of approximately percent 
we also incur an annual facility fee of basis points payable in quarterly installments 
initial borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to refinance all revolver balances and pay off the million term loan outstanding under our previous revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility matures in september  but may be extended at our option and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  for a period of one year 
the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the revolving credit facility may not exceed either i the borrowing base as described below or ii million 
as of december   the outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility excluding outstanding letters of credit of million was million 
subject to the terms of the revolving credit facility  we have the option to increase our borrowing capacity in the form of additional revolving loans and or a term loan to an amount not to exceed million 
as of december   the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility was million 
the borrowing base is the sum of i percent of the aggregate appraised property value of the borrowing base properties  plus ii percent of amounts on deposit in certain cash collateral or pledged accounts 
the borrowing base properties are currently comprised of owned or leased real properties  which are also mortgaged to secure the revolving credit facility 
as of december   the borrowing base properties had a net book value of million and were leased to kindred pursuant to the kindred master leases 
the revolving credit facility imposes various restrictive covenants on us

we will not receive any additional proceeds in connection with the exchange offer 
dividends in order to continue to qualify as a reit  we must make annual distributions to our stockholders of at least percent of reit taxable income excluding net capital gain 
we declared dividends greater than percent of estimated taxable income for and intend to pay a dividend greater than percent of taxable income for we expect that reit taxable income will be less than cash flow due to the allowance of depreciation and other non cash deductions in computing reit taxable income 
although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the percent distribution requirement  it is possible that from time to time we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the percent distribution requirement or we may decide to retain cash or distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation 
if we do not have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the percent distribution requirement  or if we desire to retain cash  we may borrow funds  issue additional equity securities  pay taxable stock dividends  if possible  distribute other property or securities or engage in a transaction intended to enable us to meet the reit distribution requirements 

table of contents capital expenditures and property acquisitions except with respect to our medical office buildings  capital expenditures to maintain and improve our leased properties generally will be incurred by our tenants 
accordingly  we do not believe that we will incur any major expenditures in connection with these leased properties 
after the terms of the leases expire  or in the event that the tenants are unable or unwilling to meet their obligations under the leases  we anticipate that any expenditures relating to the maintenance of leased properties for which we may become responsible will be funded by cash flows from operations or through additional borrowings 
to the extent that unanticipated expenditures or significant borrowings are required  our liquidity may be affected adversely 
our ability to borrow funds may be restricted in certain circumstances by the terms of our revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes
