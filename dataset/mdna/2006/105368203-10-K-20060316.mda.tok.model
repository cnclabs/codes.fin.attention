item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein and is based primarily on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and overview as of december   we managed our portfolio within five geographic segments pennsylvania west  pennsylvania north  new jersey  urban and virginia 
we receive income primarily from rental revenue including tenant reimbursements from our properties and  to a lesser extent  from the management of properties owned by third parties and from investments in the real estate ventures 
our financial performance is dependent upon the demand for office  industrial and other commercial space in our markets and prevailing interest rates 
we continue to seek revenue growth through an increase in occupancy of our portfolio and our investment strategies 
our occupancy is at december   or including four lease up assets acquired as part of the september acquisition of a portfolio of properties the trc properties or the trc acquisition 
through our january acquisition of prentiss  we acquired interests in properties that contain an aggregate of million net rentable square feet 
through this acquisition  we also entered into new markets  including markets in california  northern virginia and texas 
the trc acquisition and the acquisition of prentiss described previously and to a lesser extent other property acquisition transactions have already or will materially impact the operations of the company 
accordingly  the reported historical financial information for periods prior to these transactions is not believed to be fully indicative of the company s future operating results or financial condition 
as we seek to increase revenue through our operating activities  our management also focuses on strategies to minimize operating risks  including i tenant rollover risk  ii tenant credit risk and iii development risk 
tenant rollover risk we are subject to the risk that tenant leases  upon expiration  are not renewed  that space may not be relet  or that the terms of renewal or reletting including the cost of renovations may be less favorable to us than the current lease terms 
leases accounting for approximately of our aggregate annualized base rents as of december  representing approximately of the net rentable square feet of the properties expire without penalty in we maintain an active dialogue with our tenants in an effort to achieve a high level of lease renewals 
our retention rate for leases that were scheduled to expire in was 
if we are unable to renew leases for a substantial portion of the space under expiring leases  or to promptly relet this space  at anticipated rental rates  our cash flow would be adversely impacted 
tenant credit risk in the event of a tenant default  we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment 
our management regularly evaluates our accounts receivable reserve policy in light of our tenant base and general and local economic conditions 
our accounts receivable allowance was million or of total receivables including accrued rent receivable as of december  compared to million or of total receivables including accrued rent receivable as of december  development risk as of december   we had in development or redevelopment five sites aggregating approximately million square feet 
we estimate the total cost of these projects to be million and we had incurred million of these costs as of december  we are actively marketing space at these projects to prospective tenants but can provide no assurance as to the timing or terms of any leases of space 
back to contents at these projects 
as of december   we owned approximately acres of undeveloped land 
risks associated with development of this land include construction cost increases or overruns and construction delays  insufficient occupancy rates  building moratoriums and inability to obtain necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental approvals 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting periods 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as they require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize rental revenue on the straight line basis from the later of the date of the commencement of the lease or the date of acquisition of the property subject to existing leases  which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and common area maintenance costs 
real estate investments real estate investments are carried at cost 
we record acquisition of real estate investments under the purchase method of accounting and allocate the purchase price to land  buildings and intangible assets on a relative fair value basis 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the useful lives of buildings and capital improvements to years and over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the asset for tenant improvements 
direct construction costs related to the development of properties and land holdings are capitalized as incurred 
we expense routine repair and maintenance expenditures and capitalize those items that extend the useful life of the underlying assets 
real estate ventures when we obtain an economic interest in an entity  we evaluate the entity to determine if the entity is deemed a variable interest entity vie  and if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
we consolidate i entities that are vies and of which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and ii entities that are non vies which we control 
entities that we account for under the equity method ie at cost  increased or decreased by our share of earnings or losses  less distributions include i entities that are vies and of which we are not deemed the primary beneficiary and ii entities that are non vies which we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence 
we will reconsider our determination of whether an entity is a vie and who the primary beneficiary is if certain events occur that are likely to cause a change in the original determinations 
impairment of long lived assets our management reviews investments in real estate and real estate ventures for impairment if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of any impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset  determined using customary valuation techniques  such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as real estate investments and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities relating to assets classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 

back to contents income taxes we may elect to treat one or more of our corporate subsidiaries as a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
in general  a trs may perform additional services for our tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or non real estate related business except for the operation or management of health care facilities or lodging facilities or providing to any person  under a franchise  license or otherwise  rights to any brand name under which any lodging facility or health care facility is operated 
a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax 
we haves elected to treat certain of our corporate subsidiaries as trs s 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts that represents an estimate of losses that may be incurred from the inability of tenants to make required payments 
the allowance is an estimate based on two calculations that are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have determined that a tenant may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
in these situations  we use our judgment  based on the facts and circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that tenant against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that we expect to collect 
these reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information becomes available 
second  a reserve is established for all tenants based on a range of percentages applied to receivable aging categories 
these percentages are based on historical collection and write off experience 
if the financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
deferred costs we incur direct costs related to the financing  development and leasing of our properties 
management exercises judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed 
capitalized financing fees are amortized over the related loan term and capitalized leasing costs are amortized over the related lease term 
management re evaluates the remaining useful lives of leasing costs as the creditworthiness of our tenants and economic and market conditions change 
purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on fair values 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii our estimate of the fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancellable term of the lease 
capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancellable terms of the respective leases 
capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase of rental income over the remaining non cancellable terms of the respective leases  including any fixed rate renewal periods 
other intangible assets also include amounts representing the value of tenant relationships and in place leases based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with the respective tenant 
we estimate the cost to execute leases with terms similar to the remaining lease terms of the in place leases  include leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
this intangible asset is amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases 
we estimate fair value through methods similar to those used by independent appraisers or by using independent appraisals 
factors we consider in our analysis include an estimate of the carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which primarily range from three to twelve months 

back to contents characteristics that we consider in allocating value to our tenant relationships include the nature and extent of our business relationship with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals  among other factors 
the value of tenant relationship intangibles is amortized over the remaining initial lease term and expected renewals  but in no event longer than the remaining depreciable life of the building 
the value of in place leases is amortized over the remaining non cancellable term of the respective leases and any fixed rate renewal periods 
in the event that a tenant terminates its lease  the unamortized portion of each intangible  including market rate adjustments  in place lease values and tenant relationship values  would be charged to expense

revenue for same store properties increased by million due to increased tenant reimbursement revenue resulting from increased property operating expenses in as compared to other revenue represents lease termination fees  bankruptcy settlement proceeds  leasing commissions and third party management fees 
total portfolio other revenue increased by million in primarily due to an increase in net termination fees associated with tenant terminations in offset by the settlement of a previously disclosed litigation in million plus accrued interest on our security deposit that was released 
operating expenses and real estate taxes property operating expenses increased by million in primarily due to properties acquired in and a full year of operations of properties acquired in as well as increased repairs and maintenance costs  snow removal costs  electric expense  security expense  janitorial costs  and hvac maintenance expense at existing properties in our same store property portfolio and our development properties 
real estate taxes increased by million primarily due to properties acquired in and a full year of real estate taxes for our properties acquired in well as increased real estate tax assessments in at existing properties in our same store property portfolio and our development properties as a result of higher tax rates and property assessments 
interest expense interest expense increased by million in primarily due to several factors including i increase in average debt as a result of debt used to finance our acquisitions in and our increased development activity and ii increase in average rates on debt outstanding as a result of the increase in libor rates on our credit facilities 
these increases are partially offset by an increase in the amount of interest capitalized which is primarily attributable to our development of cira centre 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in primarily due to properties acquired in  a full year of depreciation and amortization of properties acquired during and additional amortization from tenant improvements and leasing commissions paid during depreciation and amortization expenses for the same store properties increased by million primarily as a result of the write off of tenant improvements and intangibles for spaces that were vacated during administrative expenses administrative expenses increased by million in primarily due to increased payroll and related costs associated with employees that we hired as part of our trc acquisition in september  higher compensation and benefits costs for employees and increased spending on process and technology improvements 
equity in income of real estate ventures equity in income of real estate ventures increased by million in as a result of increased net income from the real estate ventures 
the increased net income resulted from the sale of condominium units by one of the real estate ventures in net gains on sales of interests in real estate during  we sold three parcels of land  realizing net gains totaling million 
the increase from the prior year of million is a result of the value of the land parcels sold in each year compared to their carrying values at the time of sale 

back to contents minority interest minority interest from continuing operations represents the equity in income attributable to the portion of the operating partnership and the consolidated real estate ventures not owned by us 
minority interest from continuing operations decreased by million in primarily due to decreased net income from our operating partnership and a decrease in the minority interest ownership percentage 
discontinued operations discontinued operations decreased by million in primarily due to the timing of property sales for assets included in discontinued operations in as compared to net income net income declined in by million as increased revenues were not sufficient to offset increases in operating and financing costs 
all major financial statement captions increased as a result of the company s significant property acquisitions in fiscal and and the related financing required to complete those transactions 
it should be noted that a significant element of these costs relate to additional depreciation and amortization charges relating to the significant property additions and the values ascribed to related acquired intangibles eg  in place leases 
these charges do not affect the company s ability to pay dividends and may not be comparable to those of other real estate companies that have not made such acquisitions 
such charges can be expected to continue until the values ascribed to the lease intangibles are fully amortized 
these intangibles are amortizing over the related lease terms or estimated tenant relationship 
the size of these non cash charges are expected to increase in the future as a result of the prentiss transaction 
earnings per share earnings per share has declined from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of the factors described in net income above and an increase in the average number of shares outstanding as a result of offerings completed in comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december the table below shows selected operating information for the same store property portfolio and the total portfolio

back to contents gains on sales of real estate gains on sales of real estate decreased by million during from gains on sales recorded in of million 
this decrease was partially offset by a gain on the purchase and sale of a land parcel to two separate third parties during in which we recorded a gain of approximately million

minority interest from continuing operations decreased by million in primarily due to decreased net income as a result of decreased gains on sales and the redemption of the series b preferred units of the operating partnership in february discontinued operations discontinued operations decreased by million in primarily due to the timing of property sales for assets included in discontinued operations in as compared to additionally  we sold four properties and three land parcels in realizing net gains of million and sold nine properties in realizing a net gain of million 
liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months are as follows fund normal recurring expenses  meet debt service requirements  including on our one year million unsecured term loan that matures on january   fund capital expenditures  including capital and tenant improvements and leasing costs  fund current development and redevelopment costs  and fund distributions declared by our board of trustees 
we believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied through cash flows generated by operations and financing activities 
rental revenue  expense recoveries from tenants  and other income from operations are our principal sources of cash that we use to pay operating expenses  debt service  recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distributions required to maintain our reit qualification 
we seek to increase cash flows from our properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses 
our revenue also includes third party fees generated by our property management  leasing  development and construction businesses 
we believe our revenue  together with proceeds from equity and debt financings  will continue to provide funds for our short term liquidity needs 
however  material changes in our operating or financing activities may adversely affect our net cash flows 
such changes  in turn  would adversely affect our ability to fund distributions  debt service payments and tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations would affect the financial performance covenants under our unsecured credit facility and unsecured notes 
our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond twelve months are for costs of developments  redevelopments  property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements 
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs 
we use our credit facility for general business purposes  including the acquisition  development and 
back to contents redevelopment of properties and the repayment of other debt 
in december  we sold million of unsecured notes and expect to utilize the debt and equity markets for other long term capital needs 
as a result of our acquisition of prentiss  we will have additional short and long term liquidity requirements 
historically  we have satisfied these types of requirements principally through the most advantageous source of capital at that time  which has included public offerings of unsecured debt and private placements of secured and unsecured debt  sales of common and preferred equity  capital raised through the disposition of assets  and joint venture transactions 
we believe these sources of capital will continue to be available in the future to fund our capital needs 
we funded the approximately billion cash portion of the prentiss merger consideration  related transaction costs and prepayments of approximately million in prentiss mortgage debt at the closing of the merger through i a million unsecured term loan that matures on january   ii approximately million of cash from prudential s acquisition of certain of the prentiss properties  and iii approximately million through borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our credit ratings  the value of our unencumbered assets  our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our current lenders 
we currently have investment grade ratings for prospective unsecured debt offerings from three major rating agencies 
if a rating agency were to downgrade our credit rating  our access to capital in the unsecured debt market would be more limited and the interest rate under our existing credit facility would increase 
our ability to sell common and preferred shares is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about our company and the current trading price of our shares 
we regularly analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time 
the equity markets may not be consistently available on terms that we consider attractive 
cash flows the following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the consolidated statement of cash flows included in our consolidated financial statements and is not meant to be an all inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented 
as of december  and  we maintained cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
this million decrease was the result of the following changes in cash flow from our various activities activity operating investing financing net cash flows our principal source of cash flows is from the operation of our properties 
our decreased cash flow from operating activities is primarily the result of higher straight line rents  increased payments of operating expenses and an increase in other assets resulting from deposits on property acquisitions in the decrease in our investing activities in as compared to is primarily attributable to our acquisition of the trc properties in september million offset by expenditures in for cira centre and two property acquisitions 

back to contents the decrease in our financing activities in as compared to is primarily attributable to our common and preferred share offerings in january  february and september for aggregate net proceeds of million and proceeds from our public and privately placed unsecured note issuances in october and december aggregating of million net of discounts compared to our public unsecured note issuance in december aggregating million net of discounts 
capitalization indebtedness as of december   we had approximately billion of outstanding indebtedness 
the table below summarizes our mortgage notes payable  our unsecured notes  and our revolving credit facility at december  and december dollars in thousands balance fixed rate variable rate total percent of total debt fixed rate variable rate total weighted average interest rate at period end fixed rate variable rate total the variable rate debt shown above generally bears interest based on various spreads over libor  the term of which is selected by the company 
unsecured credit facility we use credit facility borrowings for general business purposes  including the acquisition  development and redevelopment of properties and the repayment of other debt 
in december  we replaced our then existing unsecured credit facility with a million unsecured credit facility the credit facility that matures in december  subject to a one year extension option upon payment of a fee and the absence of any defaults 
borrowings under the new credit facility generally bear interest at libor libor was as of december  plus a spread over libor ranging from to based on our unsecured senior debt rating 
we have an option to increase the maximum borrowings under the credit facility to million subject to the absence of any defaults and our ability to obtain additional commitments from our existing or new lenders 
as of december   we had million of borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility  leaving million of unused availability  a portion of which was used to fund the prentiss merger 
for the years ended december  and  our weighted average interest rates  including the effects of interest rate hedges discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein  and including both the new credit facility and prior credit facility  were and per annum  respectively 

back to contents the credit facility contains financial and non financial covenants  including covenants that relate to our incurrence of additional debt  the granting of liens  consummation of mergers and consolidations  the disposition of assets and interests in subsidiaries  the making of loans and investments  and the payment of dividends 
the restriction on dividends permits us to pay dividends in the amount required for us to retain our qualification as a reit and otherwise limits dividends to of our funds from operations 
the credit facility also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain an interest coverage ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio  an unsecured debt ratio and an unencumbered cash flow ratio above certain specified minimum levels  to maintain net worth above an amount determined on a specified formula  and to maintain a leverage ratio and a secured debt ratio below certain maximum levels 
another financial covenant limits the ratio of unsecured debt to unencumbered properties 
the company closed on its million credit facility in december the financial covenants included in the credit facility contemplated the impact and capital structure prospectively after the closing of the prentiss transaction 
one specific financial covenant  the net worth covenant  was formulated based on a calculated value assuming closing of the prentiss transaction would occur by december  since the transaction did not close until january   the company was not in compliance with this covenant as of december  subsequently  the company received a one time waiver for the covenant 
upon completion of the prentiss merger  we would have been in compliance with all financial covenants and expect to be in compliance prospectively 
the company was in compliance with all other financial covenants as of december  unsecured notes on december   our operating partnership completed a public offering of million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes due december  the notes 
the notes were priced at of their principal amount to yield 
on october   our operating partnership completed a public offering of million in unsecured notes 
the offering was completed through the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount unsecured notes due november  the notes and million in aggregate principal amount unsecured notes due november  the notes 
the notes were priced at of their principal amount to yield and the notes were priced at of their principal amount to yield 
on december   our operating partnership sold million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes the notes due december  to a group of qualified institutional investors 
the indenture relating to the   and unsecured notes contains various financial restrictions and requirements  including a leverage ratio not to exceed  a secured debt leverage ratio not to exceed  a debt service coverage ratio of greater than to and an unencumbered asset value of not less than of unsecured debt 
in addition  the note purchase agreement relating to the notes contains covenants that are similar to the above covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants in the indenture and note purchase agreement

as of december   we had guaranteed repayment of approximately million of loans on behalf of certain real estate ventures 
see item properties real estate ventures 
we also provide customary environmental indemnities in connection with construction and permanent financing both for our own account and on behalf of real estate ventures 
equity financing we have a share repurchase program under which our board has authorized us to repurchase from time to time up to  common shares 
through december   we had repurchased approximately million common shares under this program at an average price of per share 
our board placed no time limit on the duration of the program 
we did not repurchase any shares under the program during the three years ended december  off balance sheet arrangements we are not dependent on any off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity 
our off balance sheet arrangements are discussed in note to the financial statements investment in unconsolidated real estate ventures 
additional information about the debt of our unconsolidated real estate ventures is included in item properties 
shelf registration statement together with our operating partnership  we maintain a shelf registration statement that registered common shares  preferred shares  depositary shares and warrants and unsecured debt securities 
subject to our ongoing compliance with securities laws  and if warranted by market conditions  we may offer and sell equity and debt securities from time to time under the registration statement 

back to contents short and long term liquidity the company believes that its cash flow from operations is adequate to fund its short term liquidity requirements 
cash flow from operations is generated primarily from rental revenues and operating expense reimbursements from tenants and management services income from providing services to third parties 
the company intends to use these funds to meet short term liquidity needs  which are to fund operating expenses  debt service requirements  recurring capital expenditures  tenant allowances  leasing commissions and the minimum distributions required to maintain the company s reit qualification under the internal revenue code 
the company expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements  such as for property acquisitions  development  investments in real estate ventures  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other significant capital improvements  through cash from operations  borrowings under its credit facility  other long term secured and unsecured indebtedness  the issuance of equity securities and the proceeds from the disposition of selected assets 
inflation a majority of our leases provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and operating expenses either on a triple net basis or over a base amount 
in addition  many of our office leases provide for fixed base rent increases 
we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be significantly offset by expense reimbursement and contractual rent increases 
commitments the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to our contractual commitments as of december  this table does not include the commitment that we had as of december  to complete our acquisition of prentiss 
payments by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years mortgage notes payable a revolving credit facility unsecured debt a ground leases b other liabilities a amounts do not include interest expense or unamortized discounts and or premiums 
b future minimum rental payments under the terms of all non cancellable ground leases under which the company is the lessee are expensed on a straight line basis regardless of when payments are due 
we intend to refinance our mortgage notes payable as they become due or repay those that are secured by properties being sold 
as part of our acquisition of the trc properties in september  we agreed to issue to the sellers up to a maximum of million of class a units of the operating partnership if certain of the acquired properties achieve at least occupancy prior to september  the maximum number of units that we are obligated to issue declines monthly and  as of december   the maximum balance payable under this arrangement was million  with no amount currently due 

back to contents as part of the trc acquisition  we acquired our interest in two logan square  a  square foot office building in philadelphia  primarily through a second and third mortgage secured by this property 
we currently do not expect to take title to two logan square until  at the earliest  september in the event that we take title to two logan square upon a foreclosure of our mortgage  we have agreed to make a payment to an unaffiliated third party with a residual interest in the fee owner of this property

interest rate risk and sensitivity analysis the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates 
the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates chosen 
our financial instruments consist of both fixed and variable rate debt 
as of december   our consolidated debt consisted of million in fixed rate mortgages and million in variable rate mortgage notes  million borrowings under our credit facility and million in unsecured notes net of discounts 
all financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes and the net market value of these financial instruments is referred to as the net financial position 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position  but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the net financial instrument position

if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million
