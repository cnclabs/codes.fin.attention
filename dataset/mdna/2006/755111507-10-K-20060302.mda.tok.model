defense industry considerations the global war on terrorism  operation enduring freedom and operation iraqi freedom have altered the defense and security environment of the united states and have had  and for the foreseeable future are likely to continue to have  a significant impact on the markets for defense and advanced technology systems and products 
the us department of defense the dod continues to focus on both supporting ongoing operations in afghanistan and iraq and transforming the us military to confront future threats 
in addition  the office of homeland security and other government agencies continue to focus on enhancing the security of our homeland 
to further these priorities  the company s defense customers have been focusing on the development of the following defense capabilities speed  precision  flexibility  and the ability to share knowledge and information 
with these capabilities  forces should be better able to seize and sustain initiative  concentrate combat power  and prevent an enemy response 
the development and integration of advanced technologies and defense electronics is critical to this new approach 
overall us defense spending has increased in recent years in connection with the foregoing changes  and the congressionally mandated quadrennial defense review qdr released by the dod in february indicates continued support of the changes 
the qdr recommends certain changes to force structure  particularly with respect to special operations forces  relating to the global war on terrorism and the insurgency in iraq 
however  at the same time  the qdr also largely maintains the dod s transformation initiatives that the company has supported over the last several years 
specifically  the qdr sets forth the following transformation priorities for which the company is a key contributor continued broad emphasis on net centricity  with the company s distributed common ground system at its core  continued development of the us army s future combat systems  which the company supports through its ground sensor integrator  battle command management and execution  and non line of sight launch system efforts  continued production of dd x  the us navy s next generation surface combatant  for which the company is the prime system integrator  and acceleration of the deployment of global hawk and predator unmanned aerial vehicles  both of which carry company payloads and systems 
the president s fiscal year budget and future years defense plan fydp  which projects defense costs for the next five years  are generally consistent with the qdr s recommendations 
within the dod budget  the research  development  test and evaluation budget and the procurement budget  collectively known as the investment accounts  are a key source of funding for the company s programs 
these investment accounts show continued growth throughout the fydp 
the company also receives substantial revenue from the dod operations and maintenance accounts  which are also expected to continue to grow  and from the supplemental funds required to support ongoing operations 

table of contents internationally  the threat of additional terrorist activity  coupled with conventional military threats  has led to a continued strong market 
in some cases  these opportunities span what in the us would be termed defense and homeland security 
because of the breadth of the company s offerings  its systems integration capability  and its strong legacy in the international market  management believes that the company is well positioned for continued success in that market 
aircraft industry considerations as the general us economic conditions have improved over the past few years  the general aviation market has been improving as well 
although still below its peak performance in  the industry s performance reflected the second consecutive year of improvement compared to the industry s depressed levels of activity in and raytheon aircraft company s market is also influenced in part by the capital goods sector and the demand for general aviation products by businesses both domestically and internationally  the us and other governments  as well as high net worth individuals 
traditionally  the used aircraft market has led the recovery of the new aircraft market by months and although worldwide levels of used aircraft available for sale have declined over the last months  a downturn in economic conditions could slow or delay market demand for used and therefore ultimately new aircraft 
the decline in the worldwide fleet of used aircraft available for sale  especially late model aircraft less than years old  has resulted in improved pricing and demand of new aircraft and many manufacturers have increased line or production rates 
in order to support a continued recovery of the new aircraft market  however  the current worldwide inventory of used aircraft available for sale must be maintained or in some cases reduced even further 
due to the lower levels of used inventory and strong order activity during the second half of  the industry consensus is that the demand for new aircraft will continue to improve in additionally  the introduction of new or upgraded products is also expected to drive increased market demand for products across the industry 
company strategy raytheon is focused on four strategic imperatives grow its position in core defense markets through a focus on key strategic pursuits  mission support  technology and mission assurance  use its strategic business areas sbas to leverage domain knowledge of core defense markets across the company to achieve growth and to expand its mission systems integration opportunities  establish the beechcraft and hawker brands as the aircraft industry standard for quality  service and support  and be a customer focused company based on performance  relationships and solutions

mission assurance is the commitment to meld the company s technologies into the most reliable integrated mission systems in the world to address urgent defense  security  and aircraft needs 
raytheon s four sbas are missile defense  precision engagement  homeland security and intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance  which are critical markets for the company 
mission systems integration msi is the integration of multiple systems eg  sensors  ci  weapons to deliver a solution to accomplish a specific mission for a customer 
msi requires a thorough understanding of the mission  the systems being integrated  and the concept of operations 
to establish the beechcraft and hawker brands  raytheon is focusing on upgrading its existing portfolio of general aviation aircraft  improving cost competitiveness and flexibility  and providing true mission assurance to its customers 
to be a customer focused company  raytheon believes that it must perform  by making and keeping its promises to customers  continually listen  anticipate  respond and follow through with its customers  partners and each other  and develop and provide superior customer solutions 

table of contents in addition  the company is focused on the following financial indicators bookings and sales  operating income  cash generation  and efficient and effective deployment of capital  as measured by return on invested capital roic 
the company uses these and other measures to assess the performance of the company and its business segments as well as for executive compensation purposes 
given the strength of its technologies  domain knowledge  processes  and other resources  the company believes that it is well positioned to execute on its strategy and capitalize on the trends in the markets in which it operates and meet its financial objectives and goals 
technology raytheon s ability to execute its strategy is enhanced by its technical capabilities and domain knowledge in four core areas radio frequency rf  electro optics and infrared eo ir  missiles and other precision guided munitions  and command and control  communications  computers and intelligence ci

homeland security 
the company continues to leverage the technologies and solutions it has developed for its traditional defense markets to provide solutions to homeland security customers 
recent efforts have focused on the exploitation of the company s expertise in the collection and analysis of large amounts of data 
the company has been awarded programs in border security  most notably us visit  and in related areas 
mission systems integration raytheon continues to grow and expand its mission systems integration msi initiative 
the company believes that its customers are increasingly seeking a mission systems integrator for their programs and the company is well positioned to expand its msi work over the next several years 
examples of the company s msi success in include award of the dd x phase iv prime contract  successes in intelligence community classified horizontal integration opportunities whose aim is to integrate and link mission elements  multiple sources of intelligence  and ultimately all elements of the intelligence community  and design and implementation of an rf identification solution to track land border entries and exits at multiple border ports for the us visit program 
customer focus raytheon s customer focus is a critical part of its strategy underpinned by a focus on performance  relationships  and solutions 
performance means being able to meet customer commitments  and is ensured through strong processes  metrics  and oversight 
raytheon has a process architecture that spans its broad programs and pursuits 
it consists of processes such as integrated product development system ipds which assures consistency of evaluation and execution at each gate in a program life cycle 
these processes are linked to an array of front end and back end metrics 
with this structure  raytheon is able to track results and be alerted to potential issues through numerous oversight mechanisms  including operating reviews  annual operating plan reviews  and human resource reviews 
raytheon is continuing to build strong customer relationships by listening to customers  working with them as partners  and including them on raytheon six sigma teams to jointly improve their programs and processes 
raytheon is increasingly focused on the importance of speed and agility in responding to its customers changing requirements 
recent examples of raytheon teaming with its customers and delivering rapid  effective responses to real problems include psds  a surveillance system delivered to the us army in months  raid  elevated sensors first deployed to afghanistan in days  and mts  an eo ir system that became operational for combat use with hellfire missiles in months 
other business considerations the company currently is involved in approximately  active programs and has  contracts 
no individual contract exceeded of company sales in management believes that the company s diverse portfolio of programs and capabilities is well suited to a changing defense environment 
raytheon  however  faces numerous challenges and risks 

table of contents the company s programs generally are implemented by the award of individual contracts and subcontracts and are subject to congressional appropriations 
congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend for several years 
consequently  programs are often only partially funded initially  and additional funds are committed only as congress makes further appropriations 
us government contracts and subcontracts under a program are subject to termination or adjustment if appropriations for such program are not available or change 
us government contracts are also subject to oversight audits and contain provisions for termination 
failure to comply with us government regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from us government contracting 
sales to the us government may be affected by changes in procurement policies  budget considerations  changing defense requirements  and political developments 
the influence of these factors  which are largely beyond the company s control  could impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
in addition  the company s programs typically involve the development  application  and manufacturing of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals 
new technologies may be untested or unproven 
in some instances  product requirements or specifications may be modified 
as a result  the company may experience technological and other performance difficulties  which may result in delays  setbacks  cost overruns  and product failures in connection with its programs 
as a us government contractor  the company is subject to specific import and export  procurement and other regulations and requirements 
failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts  contract modifications or termination  and the assessment of penalties and fines and lead to suspension or debarment  for cause  from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time 
among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes  including those related to procurement integrity  export control  government security regulations  employment practices  the protection of the environment  the accuracy of records  and the recording of costs 
under many government contracts  the company is required to maintain facility and personnel security clearances complying with dod requirements 
the company is also subject to routine audits and investigations by us government agencies such as the defense contract audit agency dcaa 
these agencies review a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure and compliance with applicable laws  regulations  and standards 
the dcaa also reviews the adequacy of  and a contractor s compliance with  its internal control systems and policies  including the contractor s purchasing  property  estimating  compensation  and management information systems 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed 
if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  the company may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which could include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines  and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government 
financial summary as discussed in more detail throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gross bookings were billion in  billion in  and billion in  resulting in backlog of billion  billion  and billion at december    and  respectively 
backlog represents future sales expected to be recognized over the next several years 
net sales were billion in  billion in  and billion in the increase in sales was a result of strong growth at the company s government and defense businesses  primarily integrated defense systems and missile systems  as well as growth at raytheon aircraft 
operating income was billion in  billion in  and billion in operating income as a percent of net sales was   and in   and  respectively 
included in operating income was a fas cas pension adjustment  described below in consolidated results of operations  of million in  million in  and million of expense in the fas cas pension adjustment in is expected to be approximately million of expense 
also included in operating income in were charges on certain programs at network centric systems and technical services of million 

table of contents operating cash flow from continuing operations was billion in  billion in  and billion in total debt was billion at december  versus billion at december  critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles which requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in its financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the company s financial statements 
the company believes that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than the company s other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements 
the company believes its judgments related to these accounting policies are appropriate 
however  if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from the amounts recorded 
revenue recognition sales under long term contracts generally are recorded under the percentage of completion method 
incurred costs and estimated gross margins are recorded as sales when work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to the company s estimates of total costs and contract value 
cost estimates include direct and indirect costs such as labor  materials  warranty  and overhead 
some contracts contain incentive provisions based upon performance in relation to established targets  which are included at estimated realizable value 
contract change orders and claims are included when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
due to the long term nature of many of the company s programs  developing estimates of total costs and contract value often requires significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the impact of change orders  availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  availability and timing of funding from the customer  award fee estimations  and the recoverability of claims 
in   and  operating income as a percent of net sales for the government and defense businesses did not vary by more than 
a change in operating income as a percent of net sales for the government and defense businesses in would change the company s operating income by approximately million 
lot accounting the company uses lot accounting for new commercial aircraft introductions at raytheon aircraft 
lot accounting involves selecting an initial lot size at the time a new aircraft begins to be delivered and measuring an average margin over the entire lot for each aircraft sold 
the costs attributed to aircraft delivered are based on the estimated average margin of all aircraft in the lot and are determined under the learning curve concept  which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs from cost reduction initiatives and as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
once the initial lot has been completed  the use of lot accounting is discontinued 
the selection of lot size is a critical judgment 
the company determines lot size based on several factors  including the size of firm backlog  market and competitive conditions  the expected annual production for the aircraft  and experience on similar new aircraft 
the size of the initial lot for the beechcraft premier i is units 
the size of the initial lot for the hawker is units 
a increase in the remaining estimated costs to produce the initial lots of these two aircraft would reduce the company s operating income by approximately million in the aggregate 
valuation of used aircraft and aircraft materials and parts the valuation of used aircraft in inventories  which are stated at cost  but not in excess of realizable value  requires significant judgment 
the valuation of used aircraft is also considered in assessing the realizable value of certain commuter aircraft related assets which serve as collateral for the underlying financing arrangements 
as part of the assessment of realizable value  the company evaluates many factors including current market conditions  future market conditions  the age and condition of the aircraft  and availability levels for the aircraft in the market 
a decrease in the aggregate realizable value of used aircraft in inventory at december   would result in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the valuation of aircraft materials and parts that support the worldwide fleet of aircraft  which are stated at cost  but not in excess of realizable value  also requires significant judgment 
as part of the assessment of realizable value  the company evaluates many factors including the expected useful life of the aircraft  some of which have remained in service for up to years 
a 
table of contents decrease in the aggregate realizable value of aircraft materials and parts at december   would result in an impairment charge of approximately million 
the company assumed an orderly disposition for both used aircraft and aircraft materials and parts in connection with the assessments of realizable value 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets upon indication of possible impairment by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted cash flows 
when an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value 
the determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment  the estimation of future cash flows  and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments 
in addition  the company performs an annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year 
the company estimates the fair value of reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on the company s most recent five year plan and compares the estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
preparation of forecasts for use in the five year plan involves significant judgments 
changes in these forecasts could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of the company s reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period  however  a decrease in the current fair value of each of the company s reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge except at flight options 
in  the company recorded a million pretax  million after tax  goodwill impairment charge at flight options  as described in note a  accounting policies of the notes to the financial statements 
pension costs the company has pension plans covering the majority of its employees  including certain employees in foreign countries 
the selection of the assumptions used to determine pension expense or income involves significant judgment 
the company s long term return on asset roa and discount rate assumptions are considered the key variables in determining pension expense or income 
to develop the long term roa assumption  the company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the company has invested pension plan assets  and the expectations for future returns of each asset class 
since the company s investment policy is to employ active management strategies in all asset classes  the potential exists to outperform the broader markets  therefore  the expected returns are higher than the broader markets 
the expected return for each asset class was then weighted based upon an asset allocation within the company s policy allocation ranges to develop the long term roa assumption 
the policy asset allocation ranges are between and equities with a expected return  between and debt securities with a expected return  between and real estate with an expected return  and between and other including private equity and cash with a expected return 
the long term roa assumption for the company s domestic pension plans in is  unchanged from an increase or decrease of basis points in the expected roa assumption would increase or decrease the company s pension expense in by approximately million 
the discount rate assumption was determined by using a model consisting of theoretical bond portfolios that closely match the various durations of the company s pension liability duration 
the discount rate assumption for the company s domestic pension plans in is  unchanged from the company s pension expense is expected to be approximately million in and million in for every that the actual domestic pension plan asset return exceeds or is less than the long term roa assumption for  the company s pension expense for would change by approximately million 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption for would increase or decrease the company s pension expense for by approximately million 
in addition  the company has billion of pension and million of retiree medical deferred actuarial losses resulting from changes in discount rates  differences between actual and assumed asset returns  medical cost inflation and differences between actual and assumed demographic experience actual earnings  rates of turnover and retirement 
these losses are amortized and included in future pension and retiree medical expense over the average employee service period of approximately years 
although they are included in the liabilities disclosed in note n  pension and other employee benefits  of the notes to the financial statements  they have not yet been recognized on the company s balance sheet 
effective december   the company updated its mortality assumption for its pension and post retirement benefit programs to a blend of the company s own historical experience and a table representing broad expectations of us mortality rates to reflect changes in the lifespan of the pension population 
this assumption change results in an increase in pension expense of million
