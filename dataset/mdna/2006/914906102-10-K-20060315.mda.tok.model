internet univision online  inc operates the company s internet portal  univision 
com  which is primarily directed at hispanics in the united states and is intended to appeal to a broad consumer interest  including entertainment  sports  news  personal finance and shopping 
in  its first full year of operations  univision 
com became the spanish language website for us hispanics according to nielsen media research and has retained its leadership position ever since 
use of the internet by us hispanics is climbing rapidly 
in  fewer than of hispanic households had internet access 
by the percentage of hispanic households with internet access more than quadrupled to over 
it is expected to continue to increase in the upcoming years 
the hispanic audience in the united states management believes that spanish language media  in general  and the company  in particular  have benefited and will continue to benefit from a number of factors  including projected hispanic population growth  increasing hispanic buying power and greater advertiser spending on spanish language media 
unless otherwise noted  the data provided below  pertaining to the hispanic population in the us  was derived from global insights hispanic market report february  a syndicated service 
hispanic population growth and concentration 
the hispanic population of the us increased by between and to million according to the us census 
this rate of growth was more than times that of the total us population and approximately seven times that of the us non hispanic population 
while hispanics accounted for of the us population in  the us census bureau projects that the hispanic percentage will grow to approximately of the total us population by the year  confirming a fundamental shift in the ethnic makeup of the country 
according to the us census  hispanics accounted for of the population of new york city and of los angeles  the two cities with the largest total populations and largest hispanic populations 
approximately of all hispanics are located in the eight largest us hispanic markets  and the company owns two or more television stations and three or more radio stations in each of these markets 
according to us census estimates published july   there are approximately million hispanics living in the united states  which account for approximately of the us population 
greater hispanic buying power 
the hispanic population represents billion estimated disposable income in of the total us disposable income  an increase of since hispanics are expected to account for more than trillion of us disposable income of the us total by  outpacing the expected growth in total us disposable income 
in addition to the anticipated growth of the hispanic population  the hispanic audience has several other characteristics that the company believes make it attractive to advertisers 
the company believes the larger size and younger age of hispanic households leads hispanics to spend more per household on many categories of goods 
hispanics are expected to continue to account for a disproportionate share of growth in spending nationwide in many important consumer categories as the hispanic population and its disposable income continue to grow 
these factors make hispanics an attractive target audience for many major us advertisers

the program license agreements allow the company long term access to televisa and venevision programs and the ability to terminate unsuccessful programs and replace them with other televisa and venevision programs without paying for the episodes that are not broadcast

in addition  televisa and venevision must use good faith efforts not to structure arrangements or agreements with respect to programs in a manner intended to cause such programs not to be available to the company as programs pursuant to the program license agreement 
in consideration for access to the programming of televisa and venevision  the company pays royalties to televisa and venevision 
for a discussion of how royalties are determined and the amounts paid under the program license agreements  see notes to consolidated financial statements related party transactions program license agreements

the company s television and radio advertising revenues are derived from network advertising  national spot advertising and local advertising  and come from diverse industries  with advertising for food and beverages  personal care products  automobiles  other household goods and telephone services representing the majority of network advertising revenues 
national spot advertising represents time sold to national and regional advertisers based outside a station s designated market area and is the means by which most new national and regional advertisers begin marketing to hispanics 
national spot advertising primarily comes from new advertisers wishing to test a market and from regional retailers and manufacturers without national distribution 
to a lesser degree  national spot advertising comes from advertisers wanting to enhance network advertising in a given market 
local advertising revenues are generated from both local merchants and service providers and regional and national businesses and advertising agencies located in a particular designated market area 
currently  most of the company s television stations do not receive their proportionate share of advertising revenues commensurate with their audience share 
approximately of the company s radio stations currently receive their proportionate share of advertising revenues commensurate with their audience share 
the company strives to close the gap between audience and revenue share by persuading advertisers of the benefits they may achieve by utilizing or increasing their utilization of spanish language television and radio advertising 
the company focuses much of its sales efforts on demonstrating to advertisers its ability to reach the hispanic audience 
marketing television 
our television network and station marketing account executives are divided into three groups network sales  national spot sales and local sales 
the account executives responsible for network sales target and negotiate with accounts that advertise nationally 
the national spot sales force represents each broadcast affiliate for all sales placed from outside its designated market areas 
the local sales force represents the owned and operated stations for all sales placed from within its designated market area 
in addition  our television network and station marketing sales departments utilize research  including both ratings and demographic information  to negotiate sales contracts as well as target major national advertisers that are not purchasing advertising time or who are under purchasing advertising time on spanish language television 
galavisi n sells advertising time and also utilizes a cable affiliate relations sales group that is responsible for generating cable subscriber fee revenues for the company 
radio 
our radio network and station marketing account executives are divided into three groups network sales  national spot sales and local sales 
the account executives responsible for network and national sales target and negotiate with accounts that advertise nationally 
univision radio corporate sales represents the company s radio stations for sales placed from outside its designated market areas 
the local sales force represents the owned and operated stations for all sales placed from within its designated market area 
in addition  univision radio owned and operated stations sales departments utilize research  including both ratings and demographic information  to negotiate sales contracts as well as target major local  regional  and national advertisers that are not purchasing advertising time or that are under purchasing advertising time on spanish language and hispanic targeted radio stations 
the owned and operated stations also derive sales from the sponsorship and organization of various special events 
music 
univision music group generates revenues from its music recording and publishing businesses 
universal music video distribution corp  a division of universal music group  provides sales  distribution and manufacturing services to the univision music group 
internet 
univision online  inc generates advertising revenues primarily from large national advertisers in the united states and is represented by a separate sales force 
univision online  inc recognizes primarily banner and sponsorship advertisement revenues 
competition our business is highly competitive 
competition for advertising revenues is based on the size of the market that the particular medium can reach  the cost of such advertising and the effectiveness of such medium 
the company s television business competes for viewers and revenues with other spanish language and english language television stations and networks  including the seven english language broadcast television networks as well as approximately measured cable networks 
many of these competitors are owned by companies much larger and having financial strength greater than the company 
certain of the english language networks and others have begun producing spanish language programming and simulcasting certain programming in english and spanish 
several cable broadcasters have recently commenced or announced their intention to commence spanish language services as well 
the company s radio business competes for audiences and advertising revenues with other radio stations of all formats 
in addition  the radio broadcasting industry is subject to competition from new media technologies that are being developed or introduced such as satellite delivered digital audio radio service  which has resulted in the introduction of new subscriber based satellite radio services with numerous niche formats  and audio programming by cable systems  direct broadcast satellite systems  internet content providers  personal communications services and other digital audio broadcast formats 
many of our competitors have more television and radio stations  greater resources financial or otherwise and broader relationships with advertisers than we do 
furthermore  because our english language competitors are perceived to reach a broader audience than we do  they have been able to attract more advertisers and command higher advertising rates than we have 
the company also competes for audience and revenues with independent television and radio stations  other media  suppliers of cable television programs  direct broadcast systems  newspapers  magazines and other forms of entertainment and advertising 
the company s television affiliates located near the mexican border also compete for viewers with television stations operated in mexico  many of which are affiliated with a televisa network and are owned by televisa 
the company s share of overall television and radio audience has increased over the past five years 
the company attributes this to the growth of the us hispanic population  the quality of our programming and the quality and experience of our management 
telemundo  a wholly owned and operated subsidiary of nbc  a division of general electric  is the company s largest television competitor that broadcasts spanish language television programming 
in most of the company s designated market areas  the company s affiliates compete for audience advertising directly with a station owned by or affiliated with telemundo  as well as with other spanish language and english language stations 
clear channel the largest radio operator in the united states  radio one  infinity broadcasting a unit of viacom  spanish broadcasting system  entravision communications  and liberman broadcasting are the company s largest radio competitors that broadcast spanish language radio programming in several of the company s designated market areas 
additionally  the company faces competition from english language stations that offer programming targeting hispanic audiences 
clear channel has established a hispanic radio division and has begun converting stations to hispanic targeted formats  in english or spanish  seeking niche formats within the current music available in spanish or appealing to hispanics 
radio one converted a station to spanish and spanish broadcasting system has entered into a strategic alliance with viacom to allow it to promote its radio stations on viacom outdoor properties 
abc radio networks and spanish broadcasting systems have joined forces to syndicate three popular hispanic morning shows nationally and in markets where the company competes 
the rules and policies of the fcc encourage increased competition among different electronic communications media 
as a result of rapidly developing technology  the company may experience increased competition from other free or pay systems by which information and entertainment are delivered to consumers  such as direct broadcast satellite and video dial tone services 
satellite delivered audio  including sirius satellite radio with which the company had a programming partner agreement from through january and xm satellite radio  provides a medium for the delivery by satellite or supplemental terrestrial means of multiple new audio programming formats to local and or national audiences 
univision music group s major spanish language competitors are sony bmg norte  universal latino  wea latina and emi latin 
the group also competes against english language music companies 
univision online competes for advertising revenues with numerous direct competitors  including web based portals  such as yahoo en espa ol  terra and aol latino  individual web sites providing content  commerce  community and similar features and other media companies  such as those with newspaper or magazine publications  radio stations and broadcast stations or networks

approximately of these employees are located in chicago  los angeles  san francisco  new york and puerto rico  and are represented by unions 
the company has collective bargaining agreements covering the union employees with varying expiration dates through the company is negotiating the collective bargaining agreements at the los angeles  new york and puerto rico television stations and the new york radio station 
approximately of full time employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements that are currently being negotiated or that expire within one year 
management believes that its relations with its non union and union employees  as well as with the union representatives  are generally good 
federal regulation the ownership  operation and sale of television and radio broadcast stations are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc under the communications act of  as amended the communications act 
the communications act and implementing fcc regulations establish an extensive system of regulation to which the company s stations are subject 
the fcc may impose substantial penalties for violation of its regulations  including fines  license revocations  denial of license renewal or renewal of a station s license for less than the normal term 
licenses and applications 
each television and radio station that we own must be licensed by the fcc 
licenses are granted for periods of up to eight years and we must obtain renewal of licenses as they expire in order to continue operating the stations 
we must also obtain fcc approval prior to the acquisition or disposition of a station  the construction of a new station or modification of the technical facilities of an existing station 
interested parties may petition to deny such applications and the fcc may decline to renew or approve the requested authorization in certain circumstances 
although we have generally received such renewals and approvals in the past  there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future 
programming and operation 
the communications act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest through programming that is responsive to local community problems  needs and interests 
our stations must also adhere to various content regulations that govern  among other things  political and commercial advertising  sponsorship identification  contests and lotteries  television programming and advertising addressed to children  payola and obscene and indecent broadcasts 
ownership restrictions 
fcc rules permit us to own up to two television stations with overlapping contours where the stations are in different dmas  where certain specified signal contours do not overlap  where a specified number of separately owned full power broadcast stations will remain after the combination is created or where certain waiver criteria are met 
rules also limit the number of radio stations that we may own in any single market defined by arbitron or by certain signal strength contours 
the fcc s cross ownership rule permits a party to own both television and radio stations in the same local market in certain cases  depending primarily on the number of independent media voices in that market 
the national audience cap prohibits us from owning stations that  in the aggregate  reach more than a specified percentage of the national audience 
in  the fcc adopted changes to these rules that would generally relax many of the ownership restrictions discussed above 
except with respect to radio  the effectiveness of these new rules has been stayed by federal court order and the pre existing media ownership rules will continue to apply until the stay is lifted 
alien ownership 
the communications act generally prohibits foreign parties from having a or greater interest in a licensee entity or more than a interest in the parent entity of a licensee 
the company believes that  as presently organized  it complies with the fcc s foreign ownership restrictions 
network regulation 
fcc rules affect the network affiliate relationship 
among other things  these rules require that network affiliation agreements i prohibit networks from requiring affiliates to clear time previously scheduled for other use  ii permit affiliates to preempt network programs that they believe are unsuitable for their audience and iii permit affiliates to substitute programs that they believe are of greater local or national importance for network programs 
cable and satellite carriage 
fcc rules require that television stations make an election every third year to exercise either must carry or retransmission consent rights in connection with local cable carriage 
stations which fail to make a cable carriage election are assumed to have elected must carry 
stations electing must carry may require carriage on certain channels on cable systems within their market 
must carry rights are not absolute  however  and are dependent on a number of factors  which may or may not be present in a particular case 
cable systems are prohibited from carrying the signals of a station electing retransmission consent until an agreement is negotiated with that station 
at this time  must carry rights extend to digital television signals only in limited circumstances 
while there are proposals to adopt legislation to broaden such rights  we cannot predict whether such legislation will be adopted or the details of any legislation that may be adopted 
direct broadcast satellite dbs systems provide television programming on a subscription basis to consumers that have purchased and installed a satellite signal receiving dish and associated decoder equipment 
under the satellite home improvement act  satellite carriers are permitted to retransmit a local television station s signal into its local market with the consent of the local television station 
if a satellite carrier elects to carry one local station in a market  the satellite carrier must carry the signals of all local television stations that also request carriage 
all television stations operated by the company at the time of election made timely elections for dbs carriage and the company intends to obtain dbs carriage for each of its eligible stations 
a number of entities have commenced operation  or announced plans to commence operation of internet protocol video systems  using digital subscriber line dsl  fiber optic to the home ftth and other distribution technologies 
the issue of whether those services are subject to the existing cable television regulations  including must carry obligations  has not been resolved 
there are proposals in congress and at the fcc to resolve this issue 
we cannot predict whether regulations will be adopted  or  if adopted  what form they might take 
pending such resolution  such systems may not retransmit the signals of our television stations without our consent 
dtv 
fcc rules require full power analog television stations  such as ours  to transition from currently provided analog service to digital dtv service 
a multi step channel election and repacking process is underway pursuant to which dtv stations will be assigned to their ultimate channel for digital transmissions 
we are unable to predict at this time when that process will be completed or which channels we will be permanently assigned for digital operation 
federal law requires tv stations to operate exclusively in the digital mode and surrender any additional channels by december  while current legislation requires the fcc extend that deadline under specific circumstances  proposed legislation would establish a firm dtv transition deadline

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following discussion of risks and the other information included in this report in evaluating the company and our business 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks that we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
we receive from televisa a significant amount of our network programming and we are engaged in litigation with televisa 
we receive substantial amounts of programming for our three networks from televisa  sa de sa  pursuant to a second amended and restated programming license agreement dated as of december  the pla  and a separate letter agreement of the same date granting us rights to rebroadcast televisa s feeds of certain mexican league soccer games the soccer agreement 
the programming we receive under the pla and the soccer agreement account for a majority of our prime time programming and a substantial portion of the overall programming on all three networks 
in may  televisa filed a lawsuit against us  alleging certain breaches of the pla and the soccer agreement  as well as violations of televisa s copyrights in certain programs 
in august  we answered televisa s first amended complaint and asserted several counterclaims against televisa and its parent company  grupo televisa  sa  for breaches of the pla  the soccer agreement  and other agreements between our companies 
televisa filed a motion to dismiss certain of our counterclaims  that motion was denied by the court on november  thereafter  televisa and grupo televisa filed their answer to our counterclaims 
in that document  they asserted a number of affirmative defenses to our claims against them  and added  for the first time  an assertion that we were in material breach of the pla and the soccer agreement 
on february   televisa and grupo televisa served a purported notice of material breaches under the pla and the soccer agreement 
on march   we responded to televisa s purported notice of material breaches 
in our response  we asserted that the notice was procedurally defective and that televisa s breach claims were not  in any event  well founded 
we do not believe that we are in breach of these agreements at all and certainly not in material breach 
we have paid certain amounts sued for under protest and have filed or will file counterclaims to recover such amounts 
the pla provides for cure periods of days for material monetary breaches and days for material non monetary breaches 
we intend to defend the litigation and pursue our counterclaims vigorously 
if the company were held to be in material breach and unable to effect a timely cure  televisa could elect to terminate the pla

cancellations or reductions of advertising could reduce our revenues 
we have in the past derived  and we expect to continue to derive  a significant amount of our revenues from advertisers 
other than some television network advertising that is presold on an annual basis  we generally have not obtained  and we do not expect to obtain  long term commitments from advertisers 
therefore  advertisers generally may cancel  reduce or postpone orders without penalty 
cancellations  reductions or delays in purchases of advertising could  and often do  occur as a result of a strike  a general economic downturn  an economic downturn in one or more industries or in one or more geographic areas  changes in population  demographics  audience tastes and other factors beyond our control  or a failure to agree on contractual terms 
in addition  major incidents of terrorism  war  natural disasters or similar events may require us to program without any advertising  which in turn would reduce our revenues and results of operations 
in addition  our stations compete for audiences and advertising directly with other television and radio stations and the competitive climate can change rapidly and unpredictably in any particular geographic market 
other television and radio stations may change their formats or programming  a new station may adopt a format to compete directly with one or more of our stations  or stations might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns 
as a result of this competition  our stations audience ratings  market shares and advertising revenues may decline and any adverse change in a particular market could have a material adverse effect on the revenue of our stations located in that market and on the results of operations of our business as a whole 
because the us hispanic population is concentrated geographically  our results of operations are sensitive to the economic conditions in particular markets and negative events in those markets could reduce our revenues 
approximately of all us hispanics live in the los angeles  new york and miami fort lauderdale markets and the top ten us hispanic markets collectively account for approximately of the us hispanic population 
our revenues are similarly concentrated in these key markets 
as a result  an economic downturn  increased competition  or another significant negative event in these markets could reduce our revenues and results of operations more dramatically than other companies that do not depend as much on these markets 
we must successfully respond to rapid changes in technology  services and standards to remain competitive 
technology in the video  telecommunications  radio  music and data services used in the entertainment and internet industries is changing rapidly 
advances in technologies or alternative methods of product delivery or storage or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery and storage could have a negative effect on our businesses 
examples of such advances in technologies include video on demand  satellite radio  new video formats and downloading from the internet 
for example  devices that allow users to view or listen to television or radio programs on a time delayed basis and technologies  which enable users to fast forward or skip advertisements  such as dvrs and portable digital devices  may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of our offerings to advertisers and could  therefore  adversely affect our revenues 
in addition  further increases in the use of portable digital devices which allow users to view or listen to content of their own choosing  in their own time  while avoiding traditional commercial advertisements  could adversely affect our radio and television broadcasting advertising revenues 
other cable providers and direct to home satellite operators are developing new techniques that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences  reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television marketplace into more specialized niche audiences 
more television options increase competition for viewers and competitors targeting programming to narrowly defined audiences may gain an advantage over us for television advertising and subscription revenues 
the ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology on a timely basis and exploit new sources of revenue from these changes will affect our ability to continue to grow and increase our revenue 
our voting structure could delay or prevent us from being acquired and could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium for their shares of common stock 
mr 
a 
jerrold perenchio beneficially owns all of our outstanding class p common stock  which gives him ten votes per share compared to the one vote per share of all of our other capital stock 
as of december   and assuming no exercise of options or warrants  mr 
perenchio controlled approximately of the voting power of the class a and p common stock which vote together to elect all of our directors except two and approximately of our overall voting power 
therefore  mr 
perenchio has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for vote subject to certain matters that require supermajority board approvals and subject to class voting required by law  including election of directors  proxy contests  mergers and other transactions that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for their shares of common stock 
in addition  if either of our class t and class v directors votes against a merger  consolidation  reorganization or sale of substantially all of our assets or liquidation  we will not be permitted to enter into such a transaction unless the transaction is approved by a majority of our board and of our shares outstanding treating all shares as having a single vote for these purposes 
further  in such a transaction not resulting in a change in control  a vote of a class t or class v director will be required if the powers  rights and privileges of the holders of the class t and or class v common stock would be adversely affected 
because our television stations rely on must carry rights to obtain cable carriage  new laws or regulations that eliminate or limit the scope of these rights or failures could significantly reduce our ability to obtain cable carriage and therefore revenues 
pursuant to the must carry provisions of the cable television consumer protection and competition act of  television broadcast stations may elect to require that a cable operator carry its signal if the cable operator is located in the same market as the broadcast station 
however  in such cases the broadcast station cannot demand compensation from the cable operator 
such mandatory carriage is commonly referred to as must carry 
the future of must carry rights is uncertain  especially as they relate to the carriage of digital television 
under the current fcc rules  must carry rights extend to digital television signals only in limited circumstances 
while proposed legislation to broaden such rights has been proposed  we cannot predict whether such legislation will be adopted or the details of any legislation that may be adopted 
our full power television stations often rely on must carry rights to obtain cable carriage on specific cable systems 
new laws or regulations that eliminate or limit the scope of these cable carriage rights could significantly reduce our ability to obtain cable carriage  which would reduce our ability to distribute our programming and consequently our ability to generate revenues from advertising 
in addition  a number of entities have commenced operation  or announced plans to commence operation of internet protocol video systems  using digital subscriber line dsl  fiber optic to the home ftth and other distribution technologies 
the issue of whether those services are subject to the existing cable television regulations  including must carry obligations  has not been resolved 
there are proposals in congress and at the fcc to resolve this issue 
we cannot predict whether must carry rights will cover such iptv systems 
in the event iptv systems gain a significant share of the video distribution marketplace  and new laws and regulations fail to provide adequate must carry rights  our ability to distribute our programming to the maximum number of potential viewers will be limited and consequently our revenue potential will be limited 
we may need to allocate significant amounts of our cash flow to make payments on our indebtedness  which in turn could reduce our financial flexibility and ability to fund other activities 
at december   we had total debt  including capital lease obligations of approximately billion  including million drawn under our revolving credit facility  which expires july  although we are negotiating a new bank credit facility and expect to enter into a new credit agreement in the first quarter of  we cannot assure you that we will have a new facility in place in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our capital lease obligations and outstanding amounts under our current credit facility could have important consequences depending on our financial needs 
for example  because it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  the indebtedness could reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  investments and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to downturns or fluctuations in our business  and require us to seek alternative sources of debt or equity financing 
failure to properly manage our rapid growth could distract our management or waste our resources 
in general  we may continue to grow rapidly and this strategy could involve numerous risks  including the risk that certain acquisitions may prove unprofitable or fail to generate anticipated cash flows 
in addition  our growth strategy could result in a strain on our infrastructure and internal systems or require us to recruit additional senior management 
we may not be able to fully realize the benefits expected from cross promotion between our television  radio  music and internet business 
failure to effectively integrate newly acquired companies or newly entered businesses could undermine the potential benefits intended by acquisitions or entry into new businesses  could distract our management or could require us to unexpectedly allocate substantial resources financial and otherwise to the integration efforts 
many of our competitors have greater resources and are more diversified than we are 
there has been consolidation in the media industry and our competitors include market participants with interests in multiple media businesses which are often vertically integrated and or are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations that can provide stable sources of earnings that may allow them better to offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their media operations 
in addition  these competitors may have more resources with which to compete for ideas  storylines and scripts created by third parties as well as for actors  musicians  directors and other personnel required for production 
the resources of these competitors may also give them an advantage in acquiring other businesses or assets that we might also be interested in acquiring 
we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets 
goodwill and intangible assets totaled approximately billion at december   primarily attributable to acquisitions in the past three years 
at least annually  the company tests its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
impairment may result from  among other things  deterioration in our performance  adverse market conditions  adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations  including changes that restrict the activities of or affect the products or services sold by our businesses and a variety of other factors 
the amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to operations 
depending on future circumstances  we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets 
any future determination of impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill and other intangibles would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that the decision to explore strategic alternatives will successfully result in a transaction 
we announced on february  that our board of directors has decided to begin a process to explore strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value 
as previously announced  univision intends to explore strategic alternatives  including but not limited to the raising of capital through the sale of securities or assets of the company  a recapitalization  strategic acquisitions  and the combination  sale or merger of the company with another entity 
the process to explore strategic alternatives is subject to a number of uncertainties  both within and outside of our control  including those related to prevailing market conditions 
as a result  we cannot assure you that the process will successfully result in a transaction or  if it does  that it would occur within a specified time period 
we do not intend to disclose developments with respect to the exploration of strategic alternatives unless and until our board of directors has approved a specific transaction 
if the exploration of strategic alternatives does result in a transaction  we are unable to predict what the market prices of our class a common stock would be after announcement of the transaction 
we cannot assure you that if the exploration of strategic alternatives results in a transaction  it will produce any increase for our stockholders in the market value of their holdings in our company 
in addition  the market prices of our class a common stock could be highly volatile for several months as we explore strategic alternatives and may continue to be more volatile if and when a transaction is announced or we announce that we are no longer exploring strategic alternatives

except for the inability to renew any leases of property on which antenna towers stand or under which the company leases transponders  the inability to renew any lease would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations since the company believes alternative space on reasonable terms is available in each city 
item legal proceedings televisa  sa de sa televisa and the company are parties to a program license agreement pla that provides our three television networks with a majority of its prime time programming and a substantial portion of its overall programming 
the company currently pays a license fee to televisa for programming  subject to certain upward adjustments

critical accounting policies program costs for television broadcast program costs pursuant to the program license agreements are expensed monthly by the company as a license fee  which is based principally on a percentage of the company s television combined net time sale  as defined in the pla 
all other costs incurred in connection with the production of or purchase of rights to programs that are ready  available and to be broadcast within one year are classified as current assets  while costs of those programs to be broadcast subsequently are considered non current 
program costs are charged to operating expense as the programs are broadcast 
in the case of multi year sports contracts  program costs are charged to operating expense based on the flow of income method over the term of the contract 
revenue recognition net revenues are comprised of gross revenues from the company s television and radio broadcast  cable  music and internet businesses  including subscriber fees  commission income payable to the company by the affiliated stations  less agency commissions  music license fees paid by television and radio and compensation costs paid to certain affiliated stations 
the company s television and radio gross revenues are recognized when advertising spots are aired 
the music business  which includes univision music group and disa  recognizes revenues from the sale of recorded music upon delivery of products to third parties based on terms fob destination  less an allowance for returns  cooperative advertising and discounts 
the internet business recognizes primarily banner and sponsorship advertisement revenues 
banner revenues are recognized as impressions are delivered and sponsorship revenues are recognized ratably over their contract period 
impressions are defined as the number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of the company s online properties 
revenues are recognized when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
accounting for intangibles and impairment goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  such as broadcast licenses  are not amortized and are tested for impairment annually 
the television and radio broadcast licenses have an indefinite life because the company expects to renew them and renewals are routinely granted with little cost  provided that the licensee has complied with the applicable rules and regulations of the federal communications commission fcc 
over the last five years  all television and radio licenses that have been up for renewal have been renewed and there has been no compelling challenge to the license renewal 
the technology used in broadcasting is not expected to be replaced by another technology in the foreseeable future 
therefore  the television and radio broadcast licenses and the related cash flows are expected to continue indefinitely 
these indefinite cash flows indicate that the broadcast licenses have an indefinite useful life 
therefore  the license would not be amortized until its useful life is deemed to no longer be indefinite 
the licenses  other indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment exists 
goodwill is allocated to various reporting units  which are either the operating segments or one reporting level below the operating segment 
for purposes of performing the impairment test of goodwill as required by sfas no 
 we established the following reporting units television  radio  music and internet 
sfas no 
requires the company to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
sfas no 
also requires the company to compare the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
fair value for broadcast licenses  other indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are determined based on discounted cash flows  market multiples or appraised values as appropriate 
the company evaluated its licenses  other indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill  as of october   and concluded that it does not have an impairment loss related to these assets 
in the future  the company may incur impairment charges under sfas no 
if market values decline and the company does not achieve expected cash flow growth rates 
investment valuation the company monitors the value of its equity and cost method investments for indicators of impairment  including changes in market conditions and or the operating results of its underlying investments that may result in the inability to recover the carrying value of the investment 
the company will record an impairment charge if and when it believes any investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
related party transactions televisa and venevision  which are principal stockholders of the company  have program license agreements with us that provide our three television networks with a substantial amount of programming 
the company currently pays a license fee of approximately of television net revenues to televisa and venevision for their programming  subject to certain upward adjustments 
the company believes that the program license agreements and all other agreements with televisa and venevision have been negotiated as arms length transactions 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement fasb no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values ie  footnote disclosure is no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company accounted for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we were required to adopt sfas no 
r beginning january  under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at the date of adoption 
the transition methods include prospective and retrospective adoption options 
under the retrospective option  prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented 
the prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r  while the retrospective methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated 
on september   the compensation committee of the board of directors of the company approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested stock options outstanding whose exercise price was above the then current market price of 
the compensation committee s decision to accelerate the vesting of the affected stock options was based upon the issuance of sfas no 
r  which will require the company to treat unvested stock options as compensation expense effective january  because the company accounts for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
 and because these options were priced above current market on that date  the acceleration of vesting of these options did not require accounting recognition in the company s financial statements 
vesting acceleration increased pro forma stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
by approximately million before income tax 
assuming that there are no modifications to the affected options  the company believes that it will not be required to recognize any compensation expense in future periods associated with the affected options 
as of december   substantially all of the company s outstanding options have been expensed due to the acceleration 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
r and elected to use the modified prospective method as prescribed in the statement  therefore  periods prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r will not be restated 
under the modified prospective method  this statement will be applied to new awards granted after the time of adoption  as well as to the unvested portion of previously granted equity based awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of january  under sfas no 
r  the estimated fair value of new awards will be charged to income on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value of each new stock award will be estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which is the same model that was used by the company prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the company expects that stock based compensation recognized under sfas no 
r will reduce its diluted earnings per share by approximately for the year ended december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchange of nonmonetary assets  which is an amendment of apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged  with certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
eliminates the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the adoption of sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the effect on the company s financial position and results of operations will primarily depend on the significance of television and radio station exchange transactions the company enters into in the future
