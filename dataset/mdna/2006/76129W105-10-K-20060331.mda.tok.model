forward looking statement warning certain statements included by reference in this filing containing the words could  may  believes  anticipates  intends  expects  and similar such words constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act 
any forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  among others  the impact of dramatic increases in demand  our ability to quickly increase capacity in the event of a dramatic increase in demand  our ability to access the market  our ability to decrease production costs  our ability to continue to finance research and development as well as operations and expansion of production  the recently increased interest of larger market players  specifically bd  in providing safety needle devices and other factors listed in item a risk factors 
given these uncertainties  undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements 
overview we have been manufacturing and marketing our products into the marketplace since our products have been and continue to be distributed nationally through numerous distributors 
however  we have been blocked from access to the market by exclusive marketing practices engaged in by bd who dominates the market 
we believe that their monopolistic business practices continue despite their paying million to settle a lawsuit with the company for anticompetitive practices  business disparagement  and tortious interference 
although we made limited progress in some areas  such as the alternate care and international markets  our volumes are not as high as they should be given the nature and quality of our product  the federal and state legislation requiring use of safe needle devices  and the senate subcommittee hearings on gpos 
we continue to pursue various strategies to have better access to the hospital market  as well as other markets including attempting to gain access to the market through our sales efforts and innovative technology 
we are focusing on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to enable us to offer our technology at a reduced price 
we believe our current capitalization provides the resources necessary to implement these changes and greatly improve our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  thereby reducing our unit cost 
we are also marketing more product internationally 
in and  we were awarded a federal contract to supply syringes to various african countries 
the first award from path was for  units 
the award was for  units 
both awards were filled over multiple quarters due principally to logistical requirements for the orders 
we are hopeful that these awards will continue to increase under this program 
we continue to produce syringes and blood collection tube holders in little elm  texas 
product purchases from double dove have enabled us to increase manufacturing capacity with little capital outlay and provided a competitive manufactured cost 
these purchases have enabled improved profit margins in spite of limited revenues 
the cost of production per unit has generally declined as volumes increased 
we also have a license agreement with btmd  a chinese company 
we anticipate receiving royalties from the licensing agreement with btmd before the end of the first contract year ending august during the first contract year  btmd is required to sell at least  units which  based on the lowest possible royalty rate  would result in a payment of  historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demands for syringes during the flu season 
we reported net income of  for the three months ending december  on record sales for the quarter of million  compared with a loss of  in the same period 
these results were due largely to a increase in unit sales over the fourth quarter of  a dramatic improvement in gross profit margins  and higher interest income 
for the full year  we posted record sales of million  an increase of over the year before 
unit sales increased in international sales rose sharply in the three month period ended december  principally due to the shipment of a large order received through our second contract under the bush administration s global hiv aids initiative 
sales for the quarter and full year also include million and million  respectively  in reimbursed discounts arising from the company s legal settlement with a hospital gpo 
the diluted loss per share was for the fourth quarter  compared with a diluted loss per share of for the same period 
for the twelve month period ended december  the diluted loss per share was  compared with in diluted earnings per share in the results for reflect million in litigation proceeds  including million from the settlement of retractable s federal antitrust lawsuit against bd 
operating results  notably gross profit margins  improved dramatically in the fourth quarter and full year mainly because of higher revenues and lower unit costs 
gross profit margins rose to in the fourth quarter from in the same quarter 
for the full year  the gross profit margin was  compared with in the million improvement in gross profit and the million decrease in operating expenses in resulted in a reduction of the operating loss to million from million in results of operations the following discussion contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
our actual future results could differ materially from our historical results of operations and those discussed in the forward looking statements 
all period references are to our fiscal year ended december or dollar amounts have been rounded for ease of reading 

table of contents comparison of year ended december   and year ended december  revenues increased  due principally to increased sales in the alternate care and international market 
domestic sales were of revenues with international sales comprising the remainder 
unit sales of the cc syringe increased and cc unit sales increased 
unit sales of all products increased 
the hospital market continues to lag despite very favorable promotional pricing under the discount reimbursement program 
the increase in discount reimbursements in is due principally to the reduction of the promotional prices in april the discount reimbursement program is likely to expire before the end of  since the gpo settlement agreement under which it was established only provided for a total of  in reimbursements 
we have recognized million in discount reimbursements through december  sales to two distributors accounted for of our revenues 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues improved as higher volumes of product are produced and sold 
the increased volume results in a lower unit cost of production 
the effect of the reduction in staff in august also contributed to the lower unit cost 
royalty expenses declined due to a reduction in gross revenues 
operating expenses decreased from the prior year due to decreases in general and administrative costs  mitigated by increases in sales and marketing costs as well as an increase in research and development costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased as we continued to grow our sales force  resulting in higher compensation and travel expense 
this increase in sales and marketing costs was mitigated by a reduction in consulting expenses 
we expect sales and marketing costs will continue to increase as we work to get our products into us hospitals 
research and development costs increased due principally to validation testing and the development work on the iv safety catheter 
we began marketing the iv safety catheter in the first quarter of we also anticipate that until we reach economies of scale in manufacturing this product  we will incur losses on its sale 
general and administration costs decreased significantly due principally to lower legal costs incurred in the legal costs incurred in in regard to the abbott laboratories litigation were substantially less than the legal costs we incurred for the bd and nmt litigation in however  we expect such costs to increase as our litigation against abbott continues 
preferred stock dividend requirements declined due to conversion of preferred stock into common stock 
the dividend arrearage at december   on all classes of preferred stock was approximately  interest income increased due to a higher average outstanding cash balance and higher interest rates 
interest expense increased due to higher debt balances incurred for the warehouse financing and higher interest rates 
provision for income tax benefits consists primarily of federal tax subject to the carry back provisions 
state income taxes are also subject to the various states carry back rules 
cash flow from operations was negative for due principally to the loss for the year and changes in working capital 
comparison of year ended december   and year ended december  revenues increased due principally to increased sales in the alternate care and international market 
domestic sales comprised percent of our revenues with international sales making up the remainder 
unit sales of the cc syringe increased percent and cc unit sales increased percent 
sales to one distributor accounted for percent of our revenues 

table of contents cost of sales increased due to the higher volume of product being sold in unit costs declined due to higher volumes of products being produced 
the remaining increase is due to increased royalty expense mitigated by decreases in insurance costs  supplies  and testing costs 
operating expenses increased from the prior year due principally to increases in general and administrative costs and sales and marketing costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased as we added to our sales force  resulting in higher compensation and travel expense 
other increases in this expense include administrative fees paid under our gpo contracts  stock option expense  consulting costs  advertising expense  and trade shows 
this increase in sales and marketing costs was mitigated by a reduction in marketing fees due to the termination of the abbott laboratories agreement 
research and development costs increased due principally to labor costs and experimental parts  mitigated by lower consulting costs 
general and administration costs increased significantly due principally to increased legal costs incurred in the bd litigation 
the legal costs also increased for patents

significant accounting policies we consider the following to be our most significant accounting policies 
careful consideration and company review is given to these and all accounting policies on a routine basis to ensure that they are accurately and consistently applied 
accounts receivable the company records trade receivables when revenue is recognized 
no product has been consigned to customers 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is primarily determined by review of specific trade receivables 
those accounts that are doubtful of collection are included in the allowance 
an additional allowance has been established based on a percentage of receivables outstanding 
these provisions are reviewed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade receivables are charged off when there is certainty as to their being uncollectible 
trade receivables are considered delinquent when payment has not been made within contract terms 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for sales to distributors when title and risk of ownership passes to the distributor  generally upon shipment 
revenue is recorded on the basis of sales price to distributors  less contractual pricing allowances 
contractual pricing allowances consist of i rebates granted to distributors who provide tracking reports which show  among other things  the facility that purchased the products  and ii a provision for estimated contractual pricing allowances for products that the company has not received tracking reports 
rebates are recorded when issued and are applied against the customer s receivable balance 
the provision for contractual pricing allowances is reviewed at the end of each quarter and adjusted for changes in levels of products for which there is no tracking report 
additionally  if it becomes clear that tracking reports will not be provided by individual distributors  the provision is further adjusted 
the estimated contractual allowance is netted against individual distributors accounts receivable balances for financial reporting purposes 
the resulting net balance is reflected in accounts receivable or accounts payable  as appropriate 
the terms and conditions of contractual pricing allowances are governed by contracts between the company and its distributors 
revenue for shipments directly to end users is recognized when title and risk of ownership passes from the company 
any product shipped or distributed for evaluation purposes is expensed 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using a standard cost method  which approximates average cost 
provision is made for any excess or obsolete inventories 
marketing fees under a sales and marketing agreement with abbott  the company paid marketing fees until the company terminated the contract for breach 
the contracted services were to include participation in promotional activities  development of educational and promotional materials  representation at trade shows  clinical demonstrations  inservicing and training  and tracking reports detailing the placement of our products to end users 
marketing fees were accrued at the time of the sale of product to abbott 
these fees were paid after abbott provided us a tracking report of product sales to end users 
these costs were included in sales and marketing expense in the statements of operations 
no marketing fees have been accrued since october   the date the national marketing and distribution agreement with abbott was terminated 
litigation proceeds proceeds from litigation settlements in our federal antitrust lawsuit  retractable technologies  inc v 
becton dickinson co  et al 
were recognized when realized 
generally  realization was not reasonably assured and expected until proceeds were collected 
such amounts were net of attorneys fees  court costs  legal expenses  and amounts payable under the covenant not to sue 
liability for attorneys fees was not incurred until proceeds were collected 
reimbursed discounts the company receives reimbursed discounts from one of the settlement agreements reached in its federal antitrust lawsuit  retractable technologies  inc v 
becton dickinson co 
et al 
payments under the discount reimbursement program are recognized upon delivery of the product  provided collection is reasonably assured 
such amounts are presented in the statements of operations as a separate component of revenues 

table of contents stock based compensation prior to  the company accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  prospectively to all director  officer  and employee awards granted  modified  or settled after december  the prospective method is one of the alternative transition methods provided in fas awards vest over periods up to three years 
therefore  the cost related to stock based compensation included in the determination of net income for is less than would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of sfas no 
sfas no 
indicates that the fair value method is the preferable method of accounting 
liquidity and future capital requirements historical sources of liquidity we have historically funded operations primarily from proceeds from private placements  loans and litigation settlements 
we were capitalized with approximately  raised from six separate private placement offerings 
we raised  in cash from the private sales of an aggregate of  shares of convertible preferred stock 
in addition  we obtained a cancellation of  in debt and  in accounts payable in exchange for series v class b convertible preferred stock 
we obtained  in from bank loans of which  has been repaid and  was refinanced with a new note with st international 
additionally  we received a small business administration loan of  in to pay for portions of automated assembly equipment  multi cavity molds  and other equipment 
this loan has been repaid 
furthermore  we borrowed  in under our credit agreement with abbott laboratories 
in october we repaid the abbott laboratories note with proceeds from a new note from katie petroleum  inc katie petroleum for  and a portion of the proceeds from a private placement 
we obtained a loan from st international for  for interim and long term financing of the warehouse 
principal and interest payments began in the first part of see note to financial statements for a discussion of the terms of the note 
internal sources of liquidity in early we began to receive shipment of product from double dove  a chinese manufacturer 
fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and inventory and the ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships could result in the need to manufacture all as opposed to one half of the products in the united states 
this could temporarily increase unit costs as we ramp up domestic production 
to achieve break even quarters we need minimal access to hospital markets which has been difficult to obtain due to the monopolistic marketplace which was the subject of our antitrust lawsuit against bd 
we will continue to attempt to gain access to the market through our sales efforts and innovative technology 
we are focusing on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to enable us to offer our technology at a reduced price 
we believe our current capitalization provides the resources necessary to implement these changes and greatly improve our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  thereby reducing our unit cost 
we anticipate receiving royalties from the licensing agreement with btmd before the end of the first contract year ending august during the first contract year  btmd is required to sell at least  units which  based on the lowest possible royalty rate  would result in a payment of  
table of contents historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demand for syringes during the flu season 
we believe the sales for flu vaccine were much greater than last year due to there being no shortage in and our product gaining in popularity 
at the present time management does not intend to raise equity capital in due to the litigation settlements  we have sufficient cash reserves and intend to rely on operations  cash reserves  and debt financing as the primary ongoing sources of cash 
in the event we continue to have only limited market access and cash generated from operations and cash reserves become insufficient to support operations  the company would take cost cutting measures to reduce cash requirements 
such measures could result in reduction of units being produced  reduction of workforce  reduction of salaries of officers and other nonhourly employees  and deferral of royalty payments to thomas shaw 
since we have not seen a reasonable increase in our market share  the company had a reduction in force in august external sources of liquidity we have obtained several loans over the past six years  which have  together with proceeds from the sales of equities and litigation settlements  enabled us to pursue development and production of our products 
currently we believe we could obtain additional funds through loans if needed 
furthermore  the shareholders have previously authorized an additional  shares of a class c stock that could  if necessary  be authorized and used to raise funds through the sale of equity 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following chart summarizes all of our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts such as debt and lease agreements as of december  contractual obligations payments due by period total thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on balance sheet total contractual cash obligations material commitments for expenditures assuming we are able to access the market  we may obtain additional capital to fund capital expenditures and working capital needs 
management would fund these expenditures through debt and equity offerings 
capital expenditures could include additional assembly lines  manufacturing space  warehousing  and related infrastructure 
the expansion could include those products that have been developed but not yet marketed  as well as expanding manufacturing capacity for existing products 
we had  in capital expenditures in and  in capital expenditures in are dependent upon several factors  including  but not limited to  acceptance of the iv safety catheter into the market and the access to the market for the iv safety catheter as well as our other products 

table of contents off balance sheet transactions we have no off balance sheet transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our market risk exposures are immaterial as we do not have instruments for trading purposes and reasonable possible near term changes in market rates or prices will not result in material near term losses in earnings
