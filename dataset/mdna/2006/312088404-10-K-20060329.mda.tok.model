item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
as a result of several factors  including those set forth under item a of part i and elsewhere in this report  our actual results and the timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and other diseases of the immune system 
we have developed a proprietary technology that enables us to manufacture active immunotherapy products that are designed to stimulate a patient s immune system to mount a specific and sustained response to disease 
our lead product candidate  favid  is an active immunotherapy for the treatment of b cell non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl 
favid entered a pivotal phase clinical trial in follicular b cell nhl in july with a target of eligible patients and completed patient enrollment in january in addition  favid has been evaluated in several multi center  open label phase clinical trials involving more than patients 
we believe favid may be effective in treating other types of b cell nhl 
five additional phase clinical trials of favid are either ongoing or expected to begin during one of these clinical trials is being conducted under a separate physician sponsored investigational new drug  or ind  application in the united states 
a second of these is being conducted as a physician sponsored clinical trial in switzerland 
moreover  we believe our active immunotherapy expertise and proprietary manufacturing technology will enable us to develop additional product candidates for other oncology indications  such as t cell lymphoma  and for autoimmune diseases  with an initial focus on multiple sclerosis 
we are currently developing a second product candidate  fav  for the treatment of t cell lymphoma and intend to initiate a phase clinical trial evaluating the safety and preliminary efficacy of fav in the first half of we have retained exclusive worldwide commercialization rights to all of our product candidates 
we were incorporated in delaware in january as of december   we had not generated any revenues  and we had financed our operations and internal growth through private placements of our preferred stock  equipment and leasehold debt financings and the sale of common stock in our initial public offering or ipo in february we are a development stage company and have incurred significant losses since our inception in  as we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development activities  including clinical trials 
as of december   our deficit accumulated during the development stage was approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we continue to develop and prepare for the commercialization of our lead product candidate  favid  expand our research and development programs  expand our current manufacturing capabilities to support commercial manufacturing of favid  and acquire or in license oncology products that are complementary to our own 
financial operations overview research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of costs associated with clinical trials of our product candidates  including the costs of manufacturing our product candidates  compensation and other expenses related to research and development personnel  facilities costs and depreciation 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on the development of favid 
we have completed enrollment in two phase clinical trials and continue to evaluate the results 
we initiated our pivotal phase clinical trial of favid following rituxan in patients with follicular b cell nhl in july we completed patient enrollment in the trial in january from inception through december   we incurred costs of approximately million associated with the research and development of favid  which represents substantially all of our research and development costs to date 
we expect our research and development costs to increase as we advance favid and new product candidates into later stages of clinical development 
while difficult to predict  we estimate that research and development costs required to complete the development of and file a biologics licensing application  or bla  for favid will be an additional million 
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of other product candidates for commercialization 
on an ongoing basis  we expect to expand our research and development activities to include clinical development of fav and preclinical research of treatments for autoimmune diseases  primarily multiple sclerosis 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
although we are currently focused primarily on favid  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct toward each project on an on going basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process  product candidate completion dates and costs vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals for our product candidates could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be certain when any cash flows from our current product candidates will commence 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other expenses related to our corporate administrative employees  legal fees and other professional services expenses 
we anticipate increases in general and administrative expenses as we add personnel and continue to develop and prepare for commercialization of our product candidates 
stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense represents the amortization of deferred stock based compensation resulting from options  granted prior to our ipo  that are considered compensatory because the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock for financial reporting purposes was greater than the exercise prices determined by the board of directors on the date of grant 
interest income 
interest income primarily consists of interest earned on our cash reserves  cash invested in money market funds  government securities  corporate notes and bonds and certificates of deposit 
interest expense 
interest expense represents interest on our debt  including capital leases 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
our estimate for the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires us to make significant estimates and judgments about our future operating results 
our ability to realize the deferred tax assets depends on our future taxable income as well as limitations on utilization 
a deferred tax asset must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized prior to its expiration 
the projections of our operating results on which the establishment of a valuation allowance is based involve significant estimates regarding future demand for our products  competitive conditions  product development efforts  approvals of regulatory agencies and product cost 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of december  and  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
these deferred tax assets primarily consist of certain net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits 
deferred stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options during the years ended december  and  we recorded  and million  respectively  in deferred stock based compensation within stockholders equity  respectively 
deferred stock based compensation was reduced by amounts representing stock option cancellations and our repurchase of unvested restricted stock related to employee terminations of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
these options were considered compensatory because the deemed fair value of the underlying common stock for financial reporting purposes was greater than the exercise prices determined by the board of directors on the date of grant 
the determination of the fair value prior to the company s ipo of the underlying shares of common stock involved subjective judgment and the consideration of a variety of factors  including the prices obtained in private placement transactions of other equity securities  and as a result the amount of the compensatory charge is not based on an objective measure such as the trading price of the common stock 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized  as determined in accordance with apb clinical trial accruals 
in the normal course of business  we contract with numerous third party clinical trial centers to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of favid 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract may result in uneven payment flows 
payment under the contracts depend on factors such as the completion of individual patient s treatments and the related required documentation 
we record expenses for contracted clinical trial costs based upon patient enrollment and the dates that they receive treatment 
these costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
however  our estimates may not match the timing of actual services performed by the clinical trial centers  which may result in adjustments to our research and development expenses in future periods 
short term investments 
we classify all of our short term investments as available for sale 
we carry these investments at fair value  based on quoted market prices  and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the amortized cost of securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretions of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
realized gains and losses are recorded in our statement of operations 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  it is our policy to record a write down to reduce the investments to fair value and record the related charge as a realized loss 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented above relating to them 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december  to research and development 
research and development expense increased from approximately million in to million in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in clinical trial site costs  an increase of million associated with an increase in personnel from employees to employees to support our phase clinical trial initiated in july  an increase of million associated with supplies to support continued process and formulation development and the purchase of raw materials and supplies for our manufacture of favid for our phase clinical trial  an increase of million paid to third party vendors providing support services for our phase clinical trial  including randomization of patients  radiology and laboratory management  and an increase of  related to the operation of our manufacturing facility to support the production of favid 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased from approximately million in to million in the increase of  or  was primarily due to an increase of approximately  associated with an increase in personnel from employees to employees  an increase of approximately  in directors and officers liability insurance premiums and public company related expenses incurred subsequent to our ipo  an increase of approximately  in recruiting and relocation expenses related to the increase in personnel  an increase of approximately  in fees related to market research studies  all of which were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  due to non recurring ipo related expenditures in amortization of stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options  we recorded deferred stock based compensation of  and million in and  respectively 
deferred stock based compensation was reduced by amounts representing stock option cancellations and our repurchases of unvested restricted stock of approximately  and  in and  respectively 
we recorded these amounts as components of stockholders equity and are amortizing the amounts  on a straight line basis  as a non cash charge to operations over the vesting period of the options 
we recorded amortization of stock based compensation of million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased from approximately  in to  in the decrease of  or  was primarily due to repayments of approximately million associated with our debt agreements with ge technology finance with interest rates ranging from to  offset by approximately million of new borrowings under new debt agreements  with oxford finance corporation oxford and ge capital corporation with interest rates ranging from to 
interest income 
interest income increased from approximately  in to million in the increase of million  or  was primarily a result of the increase in interest rates during and the higher average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balance of million available for investment during as compared to million in the higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is due to the addition of net proceeds of million from our ipo in february comparison of fiscal years ended december  to research and development 
research and development expense increased from approximately million in to million in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to an increase of million associated with ongoing expenses for our new manufacturing facility  which our research and development staff began occupying in october  an increase of million associated with an increase in personnel from full time equivalent employees to full time equivalent employees to support our phase clinical trial initiated in july  an increase of million associated with supplies to support continued process and formulation development and the purchase of supplies for our manufacturing facility in anticipation of the phase clinical trial requirements  approximately  paid to third party vendors providing support services for our phase clinical trial  including randomization of patients  radiology and laboratory management services 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense increased from approximately million in to million in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to an increase of  associated with an increase in personnel from eight full time equivalent employees to full time equivalent employees  an increase of  associated with our new manufacturing facility  which our administrative staff began occupying in may  and an increase of  in initial public offering costs expensed in accordance with staff accounting bulletin topic a 
amortization of stock based compensation 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation of million and million in and  respectively 
we recorded these amounts as components of stockholders equity and are amortizing the amounts  on a straight line basis  as a non cash charge to operations over the vesting period of the options 
we recorded amortization of stock based compensation of million and  in and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from approximately  in to  in the increase of  or  was primarily due to interest payments associated with our debt agreements with ge technology finance and oxford finance 
interest income 
interest income increased from approximately  in to  in the increase of  or  was primarily a result of interest income attributable to the million in net proceeds received from the sale of our series c preferred stock in march and april liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we have historically funded our operations primarily through the sale of our equity securities and equipment and leasehold debt financing 
as of december   we had received proceeds from the sale of preferred stock of approximately million  net of stock issuance costs of approximately  and proceeds from the sale of common stock in our ipo of approximately million  net of underwriters discounts and commissions of approximately million and offering expenses of approximately million 
in march  we completed a private placement in which we issued and sold common stock and warrants to purchase common stock to certain investors  for an aggregate puchase price of approximately million 
as of december   we had financed the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements through debt totaling approximately million  of which million was outstanding at that date 
these obligations are secured by certain purchased equipment and leasehold improvements and are due in monthly installments through may they bear interest at stated rates ranging from approximately to 
the debt agreements subject us to certain financial and non financial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with the terms of the debt agreements 
cash flows as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately million as compared to million at december   an increase of approximately million 
the increase resulted primarily from the million in net proceeds received from our ipo during the first quarter of  partially offset by net cash used to fund ongoing operations 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december  reflecting the net loss for this period of million  offset primarily by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million and deferred rent of  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the increase in our clinical development activities for favid  including enrollment and completion of two phase clinical trials and our initiation of our pivotal phase clinical trial in july and the associated costs of manufacturing product for those trials 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million reflecting primarily the purchase of million of short term investments and the purchase of approximately million property and equipment  partially offset by the maturity of approximately million in short term investments 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   net cash used from investing activities is primarily due to the purchase of million of property and equipment and million in short term investments 
for the year ended december   net cash used from investing activities is the result of construction of leasehold improvements for our new manufacturing facility and the related equipment purchases of approximately million 
in addition  in we purchased approximately million in money market fund investments to collateralize a letter of credit related to the lease agreement for our facility 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  reflecting primarily the net proceeds from our ipo during the first quarter of of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  the financing activities consisted primarily of net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of our series c preferred stock in march and april and net proceeds of debt financing of million  offset by in principal payments on the debt 
in  the financing activities consisted primarily of million in proceeds from a line of credit for certain equipment and leasehold improvements and approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of our series b preferred stock  partially offset by principal payments on our debt of million 
funding requirements our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following magnitude and cost of our product development efforts and other research and development activities  rate of progress toward obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates  costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative  licensing or other arrangements for the development  sale  marketing or distribution of our product candidates and the terms of those arrangements  effects of competing technological and market developments  and the success of the commercialization of favid 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities and from equipment and leasehold improvement debt financing 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  strategic collaboration agreements and debt financing 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing may also adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
as of december   and  we do not believe that we have invested in any variable interest entities 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties other than what is disclosed in note of the notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations license obligations total includes monthly principal and interest payments 
the stated annual rates of interest on the loans range from to 
includes monthly principal and interest payments on capital leases 
the effective annual rates of interest on the capital leases range from to includes an annual fee of  through our period of clinical development 
additional amounts due under the agreement beyond the clinical development period are based upon certain events occurring 
as the timing of those events is unknown they have been excluded from the table 
under terms of an existing supply agreement  we are obligated to pay fees of up to  based upon certain events occurring 
as the timing of those events is unknown they have been excluded from the table 
we also enter into agreements with service providers and clinical sites that administer and conduct our clinical trials  respectively 
we make payments to the service providers and sites based upon the number of patients enrolled 
for the years ended december   and  we had made aggregate payments of million  million and  respectively  in connection with our clinical trials 
at this time  due to the variability associated with these agreements  we are unable to estimate with certainty the future patient enrollment costs we will incur and therefore have excluded these costs from the above table 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represents contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within relatively short time horizons 
as of december   we had million in restricted cash associated with our facility lease 
related party transactions for a description of our related party transactions  see certain relationships and related transactions 
subsequent event on march   we entered into a securities purchase agreement relating to a private placement in which we issued and sold to certain investors  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million   shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
at the closing  investors paid per share of common stock purchased and an additional purchase price equal to per share underlying the warrants 
the company relied on the exemption from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended the act  by virtue of section thereof and rule of regulation d promulgated thereunder 
the company has agreed to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission within days after closing covering the resale of the shares of common stock issued in the private placement and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued in the private placement 
each investor in the private placement represented that it was an accredited investor  as such term is defined in regulation d under the act  and that it was acquiring the common stock and warrants for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof  and appropriate legends were affixed to the common stock and warrants issued in the private placement 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r sfas no 
r  which will be effective for our first quarter of  requires that employee stock based compensation is measured based on its fair value on the grant date and is treated as an expense that is reflected in the financial statements over the related service period 
sfas no 
r applies to all employee equity awards granted after adoption and to the unvested portion of equity awards outstanding as of adoption 
we currently anticipate adopting sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method effective january  while we are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statements of the adoption of sfas no 
r  we anticipate that our adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations for and future periods although our overall financial position will not be effected 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb no 
and fas no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
sfas no 
also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retrospectively 
therefore  the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by sfas no 
sfas no 
is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe its adoption will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we may maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds and direct or guaranteed obligations of the united states government 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
as of december   all of our short term investments were government agency securities and our cash equivalents were held in checking accounts  money market funds  commercial paper and government agency securities
