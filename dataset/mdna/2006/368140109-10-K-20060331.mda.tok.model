during the years ended december   the company utilized all remaining net operating loss carryforwards created during our first three fiscal years 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of funds are customer deposits  cash and demand balances due from other banks  interest earning deposits in other banks and investment securities available for sale 
these funds  together with loan repayments  are used to make loans and to fund continuing operations 
in addition  at december   the bank had credit availability with the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb of approximately million  with million outstanding  federal funds lines of credit with three other financial institutions in the aggregate amount of million  with million outstanding  secured by certain commercial loans 
total deposits were million and million at december  and  respectively 
as a result of the company s loan demand exceeding the rate at which core deposits have been built  the company has relied significantly on time deposits as a source of funds 
certificates of deposit are the only deposit accounts that have stated maturity dates 
such deposits are generally considered to be rate sensitive 
at december   time deposits represented of the company s total deposits  up from of total deposits at december  certificates of deposit of  or more represented and  respectively  of the bank s total deposits at december  and at december   the company had million in brokered time deposits  representing of total deposits at that date  down from of total deposits at december  while the company will need to pay competitive rates to retain these deposits at their maturities  there are other subjective factors that will determine their continued retention 
based upon prior experience  the company anticipates that a substantial portion of outstanding certificates of deposit will renew upon maturity 
management anticipates that the company will rely primarily upon customer deposits  loan repayments  current earnings and  as necessary  additional borrowings  to provide liquidity  and will use funds thus generated to make loans and to purchase securities  primarily securities issued by the federal government and its agencies  corporate securities  and mortgage backed securities 
at december  and  the company s tangible equity to asset ratio was and  respectively

page capital ratios the bank is subject to minimum capital requirements 
see supervision and regulation 
as the following table indicates  at december   the bank exceeded regulatory capital requirements 
at december  actual minimum well capitalized ratio requirement requirement total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio management expects that the bank will remain well capitalized for regulatory purposes  although there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required in the near future due to greater than expected growth  or otherwise 
contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business there are various outstanding contractual obligations of the company that will require future cash outflows 
in addition  there are commitments and contingent liabilities  such as commitments to extend credit that may or may not require future cash outflows 
the following table reflects contractual obligations of the company outstanding as of december  payments due by period on demand or within after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands federal funds purchased fhlb advances junior subordinated debentures lease obligations deposits total contractual cash obligations the following table reflects other commitments of the company outstanding as of december  amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts within after other commitments committed year years years years in thousands undisbursed home equity credit lines other commitments and credit lines undisbursed portion of construction loans standby letters of credit construction projects total other commitments in the normal course of business  the company may enter into purchase agreements for goods or services 
in management s opinion  the dollar amount of such agreements at december  is not material and has not been included in the above table 
page asset liability management the company s results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income 
like most financial institutions  the bank s interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the market place 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting the company s earnings from undue interest rate risk  which arises from volatile interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
the company maintains  and has complied with  a board approved asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing the following ratios and trend analysis liquidity  equity  volatile liability dependence  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
the company s policy is to control the exposure of its earnings to changing interest rates by generally endeavoring to maintain a position within a narrow range around an earnings neutral position  which is defined as the mix of assets and liabilities that generate a net interest margin that is least affected by interest rate changes 
when suitable lending opportunities are not sufficient to utilize available funds  the company has generally invested such funds in securities  primarily us treasury securities  securities issued by governmental agencies  mortgage backed securities and corporate obligations 
the securities portfolio contributes to the company s profits and plays an important part in the overall interest rate management 
however  management of the securities portfolio alone cannot balance overall interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio must be used in combination with other asset liability techniques to actively manage the balance sheet 
the primary objectives in the overall management of the securities portfolio are safety  liquidity  yield  asset liability management interest rate risk  and investing in securities that can be pledged for public deposits 
in reviewing the needs of the company with regard to proper management of its asset liability program  the company s management estimates its future needs  taking into consideration historical periods of high loan demand and low deposit balances  estimated loan and deposit increases due to increased demand through marketing  and forecasted interest rate changes 
a number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including income simulations and interest sensitivity gap analyses 
an income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  cash flows and maturities of other investment securities  loan and deposit volumes and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
based on the results of the income simulation model as of december   the company would expect an increase in net interest income of  if interest rates increase from current rates by basis points and a decrease in net interest income of  if interest rates decrease from current rates by basis points 
the analysis of an institution s interest rate gap the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during a given period of time is another standard tool for the measurement of the exposure to interest rate risk 
the company believes that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance  it should be used in conjunction with other methods of evaluating interest rate risk 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which are projected to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets or liabilities 
loans with adjustable rates are shown as being due at the end of the next upcoming adjustment period 
money market deposit accounts and negotiable order of withdrawal or other transaction accounts are assumed to be subject to immediate repricing and depositor availability and have been placed in the shortest period 
in making the gap computations  none of the assumptions sometimes made regarding prepayment rates and deposit decay rates have been used for any interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  the table does not reflect scheduled principal payments which will be received throughout the lives of the loans 
the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities illustrated in the following table would vary substantially if different assumptions were used or if actual experience differs from that indicated by such assumptions 
page terms to repricing at december  over total months months to within over or less months months months total dollars in thousands interest earning assets loans interest earning deposits investment securities available for sale fhlb frb stock total interest earning assets percentage of total interest earning assets cumulative percentage to total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities deposits savings  now and money market time borrowings total interest bearing liabilities percentage of total interest bearing liabilities cumulative percentage of total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total interest earning assets cumulative ratio of interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities the table illustrates that if assets and liabilities reprice in the time intervals indicated in the table  the company is asset sensitive within three months  liability sensitive within twelve months  and asset sensitive thereafter 
as stated above  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
for instance  while the table is based on the assumption that interest bearing demand accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts are immediately sensitive to movements in rates  the company expects that in a changing rate environment the amount of the adjustment in interest rates for such accounts would be less than the adjustment in categories of assets which are considered to be immediately sensitive 
additionally  certain assets have features which restrict changes in the interest rates of such assets both on a short term basis and over the lives of such assets 
further  in the event of a change in market interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in market interest rates 
due to these shortcomings  the company places primary emphasis on its income simulation model when managing its exposure to changes in interest rates 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s audited consolidated financial statements and the information included in management s discussion and analysis is governed by policies that are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry 
among the more page significant policies are those that govern accounting for loans and allowance for loan losses and goodwill 
these policies are discussed in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both very important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires a difficult  subjective or complex judgment by management 
what makes these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex is the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and judgments are integral to our accounting for certain items  and those estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company periodically evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses and goodwill 
while we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
further information regarding the accounting policies that we consider to be critical is provided below 
allowance for loan losses 
the company s most significant critical accounting policy is the determination of its allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses reflects the estimated losses that will result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for loan losses results from management s evaluation of the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrower  fair market value of collateral and other items that  in our opinion  deserve current recognition in estimating possible credit losses 
our evaluation process is based on historical evidence and current trends among delinquencies  defaults and nonperforming assets 
our estimate of the allowance for loan losses does not include the impact of events that might occur in the future 
management considers the established allowance adequate to absorb losses that relate to loans outstanding at december   although future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
if the financial condition of our borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  our estimates would be updated  and additional provisions may be required 
for further information on the allowance for loan losses  see financial condition in management s discussion and analysis and note d of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
goodwill 
goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination  is tested at least annually for impairment 
the impairment test is a two step process that begins with an initial impairment evaluation 
if the initial evaluation suggests that an impairment of the asset value exists  the second step would determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
if the tests conclude that goodwill is impaired  the carrying value would be adjusted  and an impairment loss would be recorded

with few exceptions  the company requires personal guarantees and secondary sources of repayment 
commercial loans generally provide greater yields and reprice more frequently than other types of loans  such as real estate loans

repossessed collateral securing a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the loan 
consumer loan collections are sensitive to job loss  illness and other personal factors 
the company attempts to manage the risks inherent in consumer lending by following established credit guidelines and underwriting practices designed to minimize risk of loss 
loan approvals

the policies are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors of the company 
the company supplements its own supervision of the loan underwriting and approval process with periodic loan audits by independent  outside professionals experienced in loan review work 
commitments and contingent liabilities in the ordinary course of business  the company enters into various types of transactions that include commitments to extend credit that are not included in loans receivable  net  presented on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company applies the same credit standards to these commitments as it uses in all its lending activities and has included these commitments in its lending risk evaluations 
the company s exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit is represented by the amount of these commitments 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset quality the company considers asset quality to be of primary importance  and employs a formal internal loan review process to ensure adherence to the lending policy as approved by the board of directors 
it is the responsibility of each lending officer to assign an appropriate risk grade to every loan originated 
credit administration  through the page loan review process  validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment 
in addition  as a given loan s credit quality improves or deteriorates  it is credit administration s responsibility to change the borrower s risk grade accordingly 
the function of determining the allowance for loan losses is fundamentally driven by the risk grade system 
in determining the allowance for loan losses and any resulting provision to be charged against earnings  particular emphasis is placed on the results of the loan review process 
consideration is also given to historical loan loss experience  the value and adequacy of collateral  economic conditions in the company s market area and other factors 
for loans determined to be impaired  the allowance is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the appropriate level of reserve to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company s policy regarding past due loans normally requires a prompt charge off to the allowance for loan losses following timely collection efforts and a thorough review 
further efforts are then pursued through various means available 
loans carried in a non accrual status are generally collateralized and probable losses are considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
nonperforming assets the table sets forth  for the period indicated  information with respect to the company s nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  total nonperforming loans nonaccrual loans plus restructured loans  and total nonperforming assets 
at december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans restructured loans total nonperforming loans real estate owned total nonperforming assets accruing loans past due days or more potential problem loans allowance for loan losses nonperforming loans to period end loans allowance for loan losses to period end loans allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans nonperforming assets to total assets our consolidated financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting  including the recognition of interest income on loans  unless we place a loan on nonaccrual basis 
we account for loans on a nonaccrual basis when we have serious doubts about the collectibility of principal or interest 
generally  our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan becomes past due days 
we also place loans on nonaccrual status in cases where we are uncertain whether the borrower can satisfy the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
amounts received on nonaccrual loans generally are applied first to principal and then to interest only after all principal has been collected 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
we accrue interest on restructured loans at the restructured rates when we anticipate that no loss of original principal will occur 
potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing and are not included in nonaccrual or restructured loans above  but about which we have serious doubts as to the borrower s ability to comply with present repayment terms 
these loans are likely to be included later in page nonaccrual  past due or restructured loans  so they are considered by our management in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
at december   we had  of nonaccrual loans 
during the third quarter of we collected our largest nonaccrual loan in the amount of  this loan was cross collateralized and was secured by real estate 
the borrower  as a result of cash flow problems  had filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code  during which time the company was not receiving regular interest payments 
accordingly  management placed this loan in nonaccrual status 
the company did not incur any loss on this loan 
real estate owned consists of foreclosed  repossessed and idled properties 
at december  the company had no real estate owned 
analysis of allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by provisions charged to operations and by recoveries of amounts previously charged off  and we reduce our allowance by loans charged off 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance at least quarterly 
in addition  on a quarterly basis our board of directors reviews our loan portfolio  conducts an evaluation of our credit quality and reviews our computation of the loan loss provision  recommending changes as may be required 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance  we consider the growth  composition and industry diversification of the portfolio  historical loan loss experience  current delinquency levels  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  prevailing economic conditions and other relevant factors deriving from our limited history of operations 
because we have a limited history of our own  we also consider the loss experience and allowance levels of other similar banks and the historical experience encountered by our management and senior lending officers prior to joining us 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to make adjustments to the allowance based upon judgments different from those of our management 
we use our risk grading program  as described under asset quality  to facilitate our evaluation of probable inherent loan losses and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in this program  risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers and reviewed by credit administration  and tested by our internal auditor 
the testing program includes an evaluation of a sample of new loans  large loans  loans that are identified as having potential credit weaknesses  loans past due days or more  and nonaccrual loans 
we strive to maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with conservative loan underwriting policies that result in loans specifically tailored to the needs of our market area 
every effort is made to identify and minimize the credit risks associated with such lending strategies 
we have no foreign loans and we do not engage in significant lease financing or highly leveraged transactions 
we follow a loan review program designed to evaluate the credit risk in our loan portfolio 
through this loan review process  we maintain an internally classified watch list that helps management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets  management considers  among other factors  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  the borrower s ability to repay  the borrower s payment history and the current delinquent status 
as a result of this process  certain loans are categorized as substandard  doubtful or loss and reserves are allocated based on management s judgment and historical experience 
loans classified as substandard are those loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt 
they are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some losses if the deficiencies are not corrected 
loans classified as doubtful are those loans that have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable 
loans classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted 
this classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this asset even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future 
as a practical matter  when loans are identified as loss  the estimated loss is calculated and charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the above classification categories  we also categorize loans based upon risk grade and loan type  assigning an allowance allocation based upon each category 
growth in loans outstanding has  throughout our history  been the primary reason for increases in our allowance for loan losses and the resultant provisions for loan losses necessary to provide for those increases 
this growth has page been spread among our major loan categories 
between december  and december   the range of each major category of loans as a percentage of total loans outstanding is as follows residential mortgage loans to  commercial mortgage loans to  construction loans to  commercial and industrial loans to  loans to individuals to  and home equity lines of credit to 
for all fiscal years through  our net loan charge offs in each year were no more than 
of average loans outstanding 
because of this sustained trend of low loss experience  and based upon our assessment of probable loss  we have set our allowance for loan losses at december  at million  representing 
of total loans outstanding 
throughout  the non accrual and days past due loans has continued to total minimal dollars which has provided the basis for adjusting our loan loss allowance from to 
of total loans 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business 
we make specific allowances that are allocated to certain individual loans and pools of loans based on risk characteristics  as discussed below 
a portion of allowance assigned to each pool of loans contains estimated components based on historical data and the unseasoned segment of the loan portfolio 
a portion of the allowance is intended to reserve for the inherent risk in the portfolio and the intrinsic inaccuracies associated with the estimation of the allowance for loan losses and its allocation to specific loan categories 
while management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
furthermore  while we believe we have established the allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing our portfolio  will not require an increase in our allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed herein 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the dates indicated
