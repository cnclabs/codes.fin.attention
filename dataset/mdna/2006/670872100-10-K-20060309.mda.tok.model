item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview the company is a leading  vertically integrated international producer and marketer of value added  metal based specialty chemicals and related materials  primarily from cobalt and nickel 
the company applies proprietary technology to unrefined cobalt and nickel raw materials to market more than different product offerings to approximately  customers in over industries 
the company operates in two business segments cobalt and nickel 
the company s business is critically connected to both the price and availability of raw materials 
the primary raw materials used by the company are unrefined cobalt and nickel 
cobalt raw materials include ore  concentrates  slag and scrap 
nickel raw materials include concentrates  ore  intermediates  secondaries  scrap and matte 
the cost of the company s raw materials fluctuates due to actual or perceived changes in supply and demand  changes in cobalt and nickel reference market prices and changes in availability from suppliers 
the company attempts to mitigate changes in availability by maintaining adequate inventory levels and long term supply relationships with a variety of producers 
fluctuations in the prices of cobalt and nickel have been significant in the past and the company believes that cobalt and nickel price fluctuations are likely to continue in the future 
the company attempts to pass through to its customers increases in raw material prices by increasing the prices of its products 
the company s profitability is largely dependent on the company s ability to maintain the differential between its product prices and product costs 
certain sales contracts and raw material purchase contracts contain variable pricing that adjusts based on changes in the price of cobalt and nickel 
during periods of rapidly changing metal prices  however  there may be price lags that can impact the short term profitability and cash flow from operations of the company both positively and negatively 
the company attempts to minimize the effect on profitability of changes in the market price of nickel through hedging activities 
reductions in the price of raw materials or declines in the selling prices of the company s finished goods could also result in the company s inventory carrying value being written down to a lower market value 
the company has manufacturing and other facilities in north america  africa  europe and asia pacific  and markets its products worldwide 
although most of the company s raw material purchases and product sales are based on the us dollar  prices of certain raw materials  us operating expenses and income taxes are denominated in local currencies 
as such  the results of operations are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements particularly the euro and the australian dollar 
in addition  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and profitability in us dollars of products provided by the company in foreign markets in cases where payments for its products are made in local currency 
accordingly  fluctuations in currency prices affect the company s operating results 
overall operating results for  and set forth below is a summary of the statements of consolidated income for the years ended december  millions of dollars percent of net sales net sales cost of products sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income loss from operations other expense  net including interest expense income tax expense minority interest share of income loss income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income from discontinued operations  net of tax income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income operating results compared to net sales decreased million  or  to  million for the year ended december   compared with  million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily due to lower cobalt metal prices and lower nickel sales volumes resulting from raw material feed shortages in compared with  partially offset by higher nickel prices 
during  the reference price of cobalt continued to decline from the unusually high prices experienced in early  dropping from an average of per pound in the first quarter of to an average of per pound in the fourth quarter of during  cobalt reference prices averaged per pound in the first quarter  and trended downward to an average of per pound in the fourth quarter 
gross profit decreased million to million in  compared with million in margins decreased to from primarily due to the sale of cobalt finished goods manufactured using higher cost raw materials purchased before the overall decrease in cobalt metal prices discussed above and the effect of declining cobalt prices throughout compared to the opposite effect in additional items negatively impacting gross profit in were lower nickel production caused by a lack of raw material feed resulting in higher costs per unit produced  higher tolling costs due to a new tolling agreement at the company s nickel refinery in finland  lower of cost or market charges of million in due to decreasing metal prices and the scheduled maintenance shut down of the drc smelter 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million to million in compared with million in the decrease was primarily due to million of income related to the receipt of net insurance proceeds related to the shareholder class action litigation and million of income related to the mark to market of  shares of common stock issued in connection with the shareholder derivative litigation compared with a charge of million related to the shareholder derivative lawsuits in legal and professional fees decreased million in compared with due to higher costs in associated with the restatement process  audit committee investigation and implementation of processes to comply with sarbanes oxley requirements 
in addition  also includes income of million related to the collection of a note receivable that had been fully reserved in these positive factors were partially offset by an million charge related to the former chief executive officer s departure and a million charge to establish a reserve against the notes receivable from our joint venture partner in the drc 
the decrease in other expense  net in compared with was primarily due to a gain of million on the sale of investments in equity securities 
income tax expense was million on pre tax income of million in the effective income tax rate for was compared with for the higher rate in was primarily due to lower income in compared with in finland which has a statutory rate of 
in  higher income in finland significantly lessened the impact on the overall effective income tax rate of losses in the united states with no income tax benefit 
in both years  the rate was favorably impacted by the tax holiday from income taxes in malaysia 
also in  the weakening euro compared with the us dollar negatively impacted the tax rate  as the company s statutory tax liability in finland is payable in euros but is remeasured to the us dollar functional currency for preparation of consolidated financial statements 
in  when the euro strengthened against the us dollar  the opposite effect occurred reducing the overall effective income tax rate 
minority interest share of losses in were due to the losses of gtl which were attributable to the scheduled extended maintenance shut down of the gtl smelter and delayed shipments out of the drc due primarily to distribution issues 
the company expects the next extended maintenance shutdown of the gtl smelter will occur in in  gtl was profitable due to a full year of production and the benefit of higher cobalt prices 
income from discontinued operations was million in the income relates primarily to the reversal of a million tax contingency accrual  a million tax refund related to the company s former precious metals group pmg business and a reduction in retained liabilities of businesses sold attributable to foreign exchange gains of million from remeasuring euro denominated liabilities to us dollars 
during  the company reversed a million tax contingency accrual that was originally established in july upon the sale of pmg 
subsequent to that date  such amount had been included in retained liabilities of businesses sold in the consolidated balance sheets 
the contingency relates to a tax matter in brazil for which the company has indemnified the pmg buyer under terms of the pmg sale agreement 
in mid  a brazilian mid level federal court made a ruling that was unfavorable to the pmg buyer s case 
however  in november  the brazilian federal supreme court the court ruled in favor of the taxpayer in a similar case  declaring the applicable law unconstitutional 
subsequent to that decision the court has ruled in favor of the taxpayer in numerous other cases 
the court must hear all remaining individual cases that have been or will be appealed in this matter  including the pmg buyer s  and that process may take several years 
until the pmg buyer s case is adjudicated by the court  the company will remain liable for this matter based on the indemnification agreement 
however  based upon the precedent set by the court  the company has concluded that this contingent liability is no longer probable at december   and has reversed the accrual 
although the contingency is no longer probable  the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of this contingency is reasonably possible based on the length of time expected before the matter is closed and the inherent risk of changes in the political or legal situation in brazil 
income from discontinued operations of million in relates to reductions in estimates of environmental and closure accruals established in connection with the sale of the scm business and the exit of the company s closed manufacturing facilities in st

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made their best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements related to the critical accounting policies described below 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact the comparability of the company s results of operations to similar businesses 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the revenue is realized or realizable  and has been earned  in accordance with the us securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the majority of the company s sales are related to sales of product 
revenue for product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  unaffiliated customers take title and assume risk of loss  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
revenue recognition generally occurs upon shipment of product or usage of consignment inventory 
freight costs and any directly related associated costs of transporting finished product to customers are recorded as cost of products sold 
during  the company began providing nickel tolling services 
revenue associated with nickel tolling is recognized when services are rendered 
inventories the company s inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
the cost of the company s raw materials fluctuates due to actual or perceived changes in supply and demand of raw materials  changes in cobalt and nickel reference market prices and changes in availability from suppliers 
in periods of raw material metal price declines or declines in the selling prices of the company s finished products  inventory carrying values may exceed the amount the company could realize on sale  resulting in a lower of cost or market charge 
monthly  the company evaluates the need for a lower of cost or market adjustment to inventories based on the end of the month market price 
long lived assets goodwill must be reviewed at least annually for impairment  in accordance with a specified methodology 
further  goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company generally invests in long lived assets to secure raw material feedstocks  produce new products  or increase production capacity or capability 
because market conditions may change  future cash flows may be difficult to forecast 
furthermore  the assets and related businesses may be in different stages of development 
if the company determined that the future undiscounted cash flows from these investments were not expected to exceed the carrying value of the investments  the company would record an impairment charge 
however  determining future cash flows is subject to estimates and different estimates could yield different results 
additionally  other changes in the estimates and assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term growth rate  which drive the valuation techniques employed to estimate the future cash flows of the these investments  could change and  therefore  impact the analysis of impairment in the future 
asset retirement obligations the company s estimate of asset retirement obligations under sfas no 
 as interpreted by fin no 
 which was initially adopted in the fourth quarter of  includes key assumptions  including inflation rates  discount rates and the expected life of the company s cawse mining operations 
the estimated obligations are particularly sensitive to the impact of changes in the expected lives and the difference between the inflation and discount rates 
changes in the estimates of closure costs due to changed legal or contractual requirements  available technology  inflation  overhead or profit rates would also have a significant impact on the recorded obligations 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to recognize the effect of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of foreign consolidated subsidiaries  to the extent such earnings are determined to be reinvested for an indefinite period of time 
the company has significant operations outside the united states  where most of its pre tax earnings are derived  and in jurisdictions where the statutory tax rate is lower than in the united states 
the company also has significant cash requirements in the united states to pay interest and principal on borrowings 
as a result  significant tax and treasury planning and analysis of future operations are necessary to determine the proper amounts of tax assets  liabilities  and tax expense 
the company s tax assets  liabilities  and tax expense are supported by its best estimates and assumptions of its global cash requirements  planned dividend repatriations  and expectations of future earnings 
where the company has determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance has been established 
the existing valuation allowance pertains to the deferred tax assets resulting principally from net operating loss carryforwards in the united states 
stock awards granted to employees in december  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  was issued 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition when a company voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of recognizing expense in results of operations for stock based employee compensation  including stock options granted to employees 
prior to  the company accounted for stock based employee compensation under apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
during the second quarter of  the company adopted  effective january   the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the prospective method of adoption selected by the company under the provisions of sfas no 
 the fair value recognition provisions have been applied to all employee awards granted  modified or settled after january  under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and results of operations could be materially impacted 
derivative instruments the company enters into derivative instruments and hedging activities which are closely monitored and controlled in order to manage  where possible and economically efficient  commodity price risk for nickel and copper  interest rate risk related to borrowings  and  at times  foreign currency risk associated with manufacturing and sales locations where fluctuations in currency prices may affect the company s operating results 
the company has certain derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges 
for these hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss from the financial instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity and subsequently reclassified to results of operations when the hedged item affects results of operations 
any ineffective portions of the cash flow hedges are recognized immediately in results of operations 
the gain or loss related to financial instruments that are not designated as hedges are recognized immediately in results of operations 
these instruments are entered into to economically hedge certain movements in metal prices 
during  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that are designated as fair value hedges 
for these hedges  changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in earnings as equal and offsetting gains and losses in interest expense in the statement of consolidated income 
all fair value hedges are effective and  therefore  there is no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness 
recently issued accounting standards sfas no 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments  which is an amendment of sfas no 
and and allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
sfas no

as such  the results of operations are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements particularly the euro and the australian dollar 
in addition  fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and profitability in us dollars of products provided by the company in foreign markets in cases where payments for its products are made in local currency

environmental matters the company is subject to a wide variety of environmental laws and regulations in the united states and in foreign countries as a result of its operations and use of certain substances that are  or have been  used  produced or discharged by its plants 
in addition  soil and or groundwater contamination presently exists and may in the future be discovered at levels that require remediation under environmental laws at properties now or previously owned  operated or used by the company 
due to the ongoing development and understanding of facts and remedial options and due to the possibility of unanticipated regulatory developments  the amount and timing of future environmental expenditures could vary significantly 
although it is difficult to quantify the potential impact of compliance with or liability under environmental protection laws  based on presently available information  the company believes that its ultimate aggregate cost of environmental remediation as well as liability under environmental protection laws will not result in a material adverse effect upon its financial condition or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financing activities  is exposed to changes in metal prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company manages exposures to changes in metal prices  interest rates and  at times  foreign currency exchange rates through its regular operating and financing activities  which include the use of derivative instruments 
the primary raw materials used by the company in manufacturing its products are cobalt and nickel 
the company s supply of cobalt has historically been sourced from the drc  australia and finland 
although the company has never experienced a significant shortage of cobalt raw material  production problems and political and civil instability in certain supplier countries may in the future affect the supply and market price of cobalt raw materials 
nickel historically has been sourced from australia  finland and brazil 
in december  the company purchased an intermediate nickel refining facility and associated mine deposits in australia the cawse mine  which provide the company with direct access to approximately  tons of nickel per year 
currently  the company has arrangements in place for approximately of its projected nickel refining capacity for this amount includes both supply contracts for raw material feed and tolling agreements to toll refine third party feedstocks 
during  the company reached an agreement to toll refine approximately  to  tons of contained nickel per year over a three year period  starting july  and ending july  as a result of the agreement  the company s harjavalta  finland refinery will be operating near practical capacity in the second half of currently  the company has arrangements in place for approximately of its practical nickel refining capacity for and the cost of the company s raw materials fluctuates due to actual or perceived changes in supply and demand  changes in cobalt and nickel reference market prices and changes in availability from suppliers 
the company attempts to mitigate changes in availability by maintaining adequate inventory levels and long term supply relationships with a variety of producers 
fluctuations in the prices of cobalt and nickel have been significant in the past and the company believes that cobalt and nickel price fluctuations are likely to continue in the future 
the company attempts to pass through to its customers increases in raw material prices by increasing the prices of its products 
the company s profitability is largely dependent on the company s ability to maintain the differential between its product prices and product costs 
certain sales contracts and raw material purchase contracts contain variable pricing that adjusts based on changes in the price of cobalt and nickel 
during periods of rapidly changing metal prices  however  there may be price lags that can impact the short term profitability and cash flow from operations of the company both positively and negatively 
the company attempts to minimize the effect on profitability of changes in the market price of nickel through hedging activities 
reductions in the price of raw materials or declines in the selling prices of the company s finished goods could also result in the company s inventory carrying value being written down to a lower market value 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
the company predominantly utilizes us dollar denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
the majority of the company s borrowings are in fixed rate instruments 
the company entered into interest rate swap agreements to convert a portion of the fixed rate instruments to variable rate contracts 
there is an inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report 
the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates of the company s debt 
fixed rate senior subordinated variable notes rate debt total book value interest rate at fair value at the interest rate on the variable rate debt is based on the libor rate as of november  plus 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report for further discussion

although most of the company s raw material purchases and product sales are based on the us dollar  prices of certain raw materials  non us operating expenses and income taxes are denominated in local currencies
