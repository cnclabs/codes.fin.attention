table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this overview is intended to provide a context for the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  included in this annual report on form k 
we have attempted to identify the most important matters on which our management focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance and the short term and long term opportunities  challenges and risks including material trends and uncertainties which we face 
we also discuss the actions we are taking to address these opportunities  challenges and risks 
the overview is not intended as a summary of  or a substitute for review of  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation business carpenter is engaged in the manufacturing  fabrication  and distribution of specialty metals and engineered products 
we primarily process basic raw materials such as nickel  titanium  chromium  iron scrap and other metal alloying elements through various melting  hot forming and cold working facilities to produce finished products in the form of billet  bar  rod  wire  narrow strip  special shapes  and hollow forms in many sizes and finishes 
we also produce certain metal powders and fabricated metal products 
in addition  ceramic products are produced from various raw materials using molding  heating and other processes 
our specialty metals segment includes the manufacturing and distribution of stainless steels  titanium  high temperature alloys  electronic alloys  tool steels and other alloys in billet  bar  wire  rod  strip and powder forms 
specialty metals sales are distributed directly from our production plants and distribution network as well as through independent distributors 
our engineered products segment includes the manufacture and sale of structural ceramic products  ceramic cores for the investment casting industry and custom shaped bar 
the table below shows our net sales by major product class for the past three fiscal years in millions special alloys stainless steels titanium products ceramics and other materials tool and other steels total net sales 
table of contents unlike many other specialty steel producers  we operate our own worldwide network of service distribution centers 
these service centers  located in the united states  canada  mexico and europe  allow us to work more closely with customers and to offer various just in time stocking programs 
as a result  we often serve as a technical partner in customizing specialty metals or in developing new ones 
our sales are across a diversified list of end use markets 
the table below summarizes our sales by market over the past three fiscal years 
in millions aerospace industrial consumer automotive medical power generation total net sales in an effort to increase revenue and profits  we have increased our presence in fast growing international markets 
in recent years  we have expanded our sales and marketing efforts in europe  asia  and north america 
our european headquarters are based in brussels  with our asian sales directed from singapore 
outside the united states  company owned distribution facilities are located in mexico  canada  the united kingdom and belgium 
in addition to the united states  where the majority of our manufacturing exists  we have manufacturing facilities in the united kingdom  mexico  sweden and australia 
in fiscal  million  or percent of our sales were to customers outside of the united states 
we believe that our ability to be a product innovator in special material development and manufacturing is an important factor in the success of the company 
our strong commitment to setting new industry standards is evidenced by our specialty alloys research and development center  where teams work in such areas as physical metallurgy  analytical chemistry  materials characterization and process and systems development 
we also have highly skilled engineering teams specializing in specific products at each of our engineered products operations 
business trends net sales and earnings for the past three fiscal years are summarized below in millions  except per share data net sales net income diluted earnings per share 
table of contents our results of operations have improved significantly over the past three fiscal years largely as a result of favorable market conditions and our focus on lean and variation reduction  especially in the aerospace and medical markets 
the key components of our business practices are as follows a shift in product mix to higher value materials  improved margins from an intentional reduction in the sale of marginally profitable products  pricing products for the value delivered  expansion of sales in markets outside of the us  efforts to achieve operational excellence through our focus on lean and variation reduction 
specifically  we use the phrase lean and variation reduction to refer to eliminating or reducing non value added activities  process variation reduction  process control  work concentration  product flow based on specific customer quantity demand and constraint removal 
our lean and variation reduction philosophy applies to all aspects of our business  including product development  order taking and scheduling  manufacturing  logistics and administrative processes 
increases in the cost of raw materials have impacted our operations over the past few years 
we  and others in our industry  generally have been able to pass these cost increases through to our customers using surcharges or base price increases 
this has impacted our sales numbers and had a dilutive effect on our gross profit percentages as described later in this discussion 
the amount of net pension expense has varied significantly over the past three years and may continue to do so in the future 
the net pension expense is actuarially determined at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon the value of the assets in the pension trusts as well as actuarial assumptions  such as the discount rate used to value future liabilities and anticipated performance of investments 
volatility in long term interest rates and investment performance has resulted in changes in net pension expense 
the impacts on the past three years are described in the discussions below 
pre tax net pension expense  comprised of pension expense or income and post retirement medical expenses  in fiscal years   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
special items recorded in fiscal years and during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain of million before taxes on the sale of our subsidiary  carpenter special products corporation cspc 
the divestiture was part of the company s strategy to focus on its specialty material businesses 
cspc had sales of less than million in fiscal and accounted for less than percent of consolidated operating income 
in fiscal  we incurred a loss on the early retirement of debt of million before taxes 
this loss was a result of a million open market purchase of certain medium term notes previously issued by the company and the termination of interest rate swaps associated with the partial repayment of foreign currency loans
