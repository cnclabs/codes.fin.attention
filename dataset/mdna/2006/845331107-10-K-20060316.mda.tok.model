item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation certain contractual commitments and indemnities 
we have entered into  and may continue to enter into  design and construction contracts for water and wastewater facilities 
these construction activities involve potential risks  including shortages of materials and labor  work stoppages  labor relations disputes  weather interference  engineering  environmental  permitting or geological problems and unanticipated cost increases for reasons beyond our control 
these issues could give rise to delays  cost overruns or performance deficiencies  or otherwise adversely affect the design  construction or operation of the project 
to minimize our exposure to the risks associated with construction projects  we attempt to procure maximum price contracts from significant subcontractors  and secure performance and completion bonds from those subcontractors 
certain of our contracts are fixed price contracts  where we may bear all  or a significant portion of  the risk for cost overruns 
under these fixed price contracts  our contract pricing is established in part based on fixed  firm subcontractor quotes or contracts and on cost and scheduling estimates 
these estimates may be based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other issues 
if these subcontractor quotations or cost estimates prove inaccurate  or if circumstances change  cost overruns may occur  and we could experience reduced profits or  in some cases  a loss for that project 
there can be no assurance that we can avoid additional costs under these types of contracts 
environmental and water quality risks 
our services group is subject to environmental and water quality risks 
our clients  municipalities or public agencies are the owners of the facilities that we operate under contract 
these facilities must be operated in accordance with various federal and state water quality standards 
we also handle certain hazardous materials at these facilities  such as chlorine gas and hydrogen sulfide 
any failures of our operation of the facilities  including sewage spills  noncompliance with water quality standards  hazardous material leaks and spills  and similar events  could expose us to environmental liabilities  claims and litigation costs 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully manage these issues  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
escalating costs 
our operating costs  construction costs and costs of providing services may rise faster than our revenues 
many of our contracts with municipalities include contractual price increases tied to national consumer price indices 
however  our costs are subject to market conditions and other factors  which may increase significantly higher than a generalized price index 
the largest component of our operating costs is made up of salaries and wages 
these costs are impacted by the local supply and demand for qualified labor 
other large components of our costs are general insurance  workers compensation insurance  employee benefits and health insurance costs 
these costs may increase at rates higher than a price index and may have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
contract cancellations 
our operations and maintenance contracts may be canceled  reducing our revenues and backlog 
also  we may not secure new construction and construction management projects on a consistent basis  leading to fluctuations in revenues and backlog 
our service group revenue backlog consists of new and existing contracts 
we include new contracts in the backlog when we have a signed contract 
revenues included in our backlog may be realized over a multi year period 
the o m contracts signed by our services group typically have durations of three to five years  and the uncompleted remaining portion of these existing contracts is reflected in the backlog 
although our services group tends to experience high renewal rates  municipalities and cities periodically change operators or terminate outsourcing at the end of a contract 
the inability to renew existing contracts could have a material adverse impact on our services group 
in addition  a municipality could cancel a long term contract without notice 
this would result in loss of revenues and operating profits and could involve us in litigation if a breach of contract occurs 
other risk factors capital resources 
our capital resources may restrict our ability to operate and expand our business 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation certain contractual commitments and indemnities 
we anticipate that our available line of credit borrowing capacity  cash balances  cash flow generated from operations  and execution of additional financing alternatives will enable us to continue operating and expanding our business 
we may be unable to renew our credit facilities when they expire 
we may be unable to execute additional financing alternatives at terms that we find acceptable 
if we were unable to renew our existing lines of credit  or if we were unable to execute additional financing alternatives  our capital spending would be reduced or delayed  and any future acquisitions would be delayed or eliminated 
while we have the ability to take these actions  they could negatively impact our revenues  revenue growth and profitability 
debt covenants 
we are subject to debt covenants 
we are obligated to comply with specified debt covenants under certain of our loan and debt agreements 
failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could limit future borrowing  and we could face penalties  increased borrowing costs  litigation  acceleration of maturity schedules and cross default issues 
such actions by our creditors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
geographic diversity 
our operations are subject to certain risks due to their location 
we own or operate water and wastewater facilities in numerous locations in numerous states and  consequently  we are subject to widely differing weather  political  water supply  labor supply  utility cost  regulatory  economic and other risks in the areas we service 
we cannot control these risks 
however  we believe that our broad geographic service area  while exposing us to these risks in numerous local markets  provides us a certain amount of geographical diversification against these risks at a consolidated company level 
internal control weaknesses 
internal control weaknesses could have an adverse effect on us 
as reported under item a of our form k  our management concluded that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  management took steps to remediate the material weakness which resulted in an assessment that management maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december  controls that function effectively today may become inadequate due to changes in conditions 
insufficient internal controls could result in lack of compliance with contractual agreements  misstatements in our financial statements in amounts that could be material and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
information technology 
we rely on a number of complex business systems that could malfunction 
our businesses are dependent on several complex business systems that must function reliably in order for us to operate effectively 
among other things  system malfunctions could prevent us from operating or monitoring our facilities  billing accurately and timely analyzing financial results 
our profitability and cash flow could be impacted negatively in the event these systems do not operate effectively 
uninsured risks 
we retain certain risks not covered by our insurance policies 
we evaluate our risks and insurance coverage annually 
our evaluation considers the costs  risks and benefits of retaining versus insuring various risks as well as the availability of certain types of insurance coverage 
retained risks are associated with deductible limits  partial self insurance programs and insurance policy coverage ceilings 
we cannot assure you that we will not face uninsured losses pertaining to the risks we have retained or that such uninsured losses will not affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations

in  and  operating income includes reimbursement of incremental costs pursuant to a settlement agreement 
in  we were required to remove some of our wells from service due to chemical contamination 
this has resulted in our california utility purchasing a significant portion of its water supply from other sources since in may  a settlement agreement was reached among some of the parties allegedly responsible for the contamination and our california water utility 
pursuant to the agreement we received reimbursement of million per share  net of tax in for incremental water and energy costs incurred in  and arising from the contamination 
since this reimbursement was an unusual event  we recorded the million in other income rather than as an increase to operating income in accordance with the provisions of apb no

md a contains forward looking statements see forward looking statements on page of this report 
overview southwest water company provides a broad range of services including water production  treatment and distribution  wastewater collection and treatment  utility billing and collection  utility infrastructure construction management  and public works services 
we own regulated public utilities and also serve cities  utility districts and private companies under contract 
our subsidiaries are segmented into two operating groups our utility group and our services group 
utility group our utility group owns public water and wastewater utilities in alabama  california  new mexico  oklahoma and texas 
except for our california utility  our utilities are operated by companies in our services group  which we describe below 
state and federal agencies issue regulations regarding standards of water quality  safety  environmental and other matters which affect these operations 
the rates that our regulated utility subsidiaries charge for water and wastewater usage are established by state or local authorities 
utility group revenues reflect fees earned for the production and distribution of water and the collection and treatment of sewage for residential  business  industrial and public authority use 
the group s operating expenses reflect the costs associated with purchasing  producing and distributing water  collecting and treating wastewater  salaries  wages and employee benefits  facilities costs  supplies and equipment  repairs and maintenance  professional fees and other costs 
services group our services group operates our contract service businesses in which we operate and maintain water and wastewater facilities owned by cities  public agencies  municipal utility districts  private entities and investor owned utilities  including most of our own utilities 
our services group operates primarily in alabama  california  colorado  georgia  mississippi  new jersey  new mexico  south dakota and texas 
while state and federal agencies issue regulations regarding standards of water quality  safety  environmental and other matters which affect these operations  our services group s pricing is not subject to regulation 
services group revenues reflect fees earned for water and wastewater facility operations and maintenance services  equipment maintenance and repair  sewer pipeline cleaning  billing and collection services  public works and state certified water and wastewater laboratory analysis 
our services group also facilitates the design  construction  project management  and operating aspects of various water and wastewater projects 
the group s operating expenses reflect salaries  wages and employee benefits  facilities costs  supplies and equipment  repairs and maintenance  professional fees and other costs 
most work performed by the services group is required to be performed by state licensed and certified technicians 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to personnel  facilities  insurance  consulting and professional services  which support our sales  marketing  human resources  finance and administration functions for the entire company 
acquisitions and dispositions our financial position  results of operations and cash flows have been affected by our history of acquisitions and  in  a disposition 
our most recent significant acquisitions  which affect the comparability of the historical financial condition and results of operations described in the md a  are utility group monarch utilities  a texas based water utility  acquired in july  an alabama based wastewater collection and treatment system  which we operate as southwest water alabama  in september  services group ace technologies  a texas based water and wastewater testing laboratory  acquired in september  and novus utilities  an alabama based contract operations company  acquired in march in june we sold master tek international  inc  our submetering business that provided multi family residential utility metering  billing and collection services for residential properties 
the sale of this business  which was part of our services group  is not expected to affect the operations of our remaining businesses in the services group or our utility group 
as a result of the sale  the business we sold is reflected as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements and the discussion below reflects only continuing operations for all periods 
business outlook the water and wastewater industry generates annual revenues in excess of billion in the united states 
both services are primarily owned by government municipalities 
growing regulatory complexity and escalating water quality awareness has led to a dwindling supply of low cost potable water 
the market is characterized by an aging and deteriorating municipal infrastructure and there is minimal state and federal government funding available to upgrade these systems to meet the higher standards 
the epa estimates that an investment of up to a trillion dollars may be needed over the next years 
these factors lead us to a very positive outlook for growth in our industry as more government entities look to the private sector to help them meet these challenges 
we intend to grow our market share of this industry by focusing on both increasing the number of utilities we own and on increasing the dollars generated by operating and maintaining government owned utilities 
our long term strategic plan is to increase our profitability through acquisitions and organic growth in both our utility group and our services group 
the utility group growth strategy focuses on accretive acquisitions  organic customer growth and managing rate proceedings 
we look to acquire profitable utilities located within our geographic footprint  thereby expanding our presence in a region and gaining economies of scale 
some of our utilities experience new development in their service areas which generates organic growth through increased customer connections 
we manage rate proceedings to ensure a reasonable rate of return on investments in our capital assets 
the services group growth strategy focuses on expanding our client base  making profitable acquisitions and providing peripheral services such as water supply treatment projects 
by pursuing new operations and maintenance contracts with cities  municipalities and private owners of water and wastewater utilities within our geographic footprint  we expand our presence in a region and gain economies of scale 
we look to expand the scope of our contracts with current clients by adding additional services such as billing and collections and providing capital improvement project management services 
we offer peripheral services to our clients such as laboratory testing and meter replacement 
an opportunity unique to our business model is that it includes an integrated strategy which means the services group provides construction and operation and maintenance services for our utility group 
this provides us with economies of scale 
in addition  we are pursuing federal government contracting opportunities as the government has an initiative to transfer the responsibility for the operation and maintenance of its utility systems to the private sector 
we also continue to aggressively pursue acquisitions of small  strategic service companies that expand our geographic presence and give us knowledge of the regions water and wastewater needs 
we feel this positions us for growth both in the service as well as the utility side of the business as municipalities look to form public private partnerships 
this was demonstrated in by our march acquisition of novus utilities  a contract operations business in alabama which in turn led to the acquisition of a utility business  southwest water alabama  in september results of operations compared to revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  by segment  revenues increased as follows percent of revenues in thousands  except percentage data increase decrease utility group services group total utility group 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the following a million increase attributable to including a full year of revenue for monarch utilities which we acquired in mid july  a million increase from our new mexico and texas utilities primarily resulting from an increase in the number of connections  a million increase from higher rates at our california utility  and a million increase related to our acquisition of a wastewater treatment facility in alabama at the end of the third quarter of  offset by a million decrease in revenues from our california utility due to lower consumption as a result of cooler temperatures and higher rainfall versus the prior year 
services group 
revenues increased million  or  to million from million for the prior year 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to the following a million increase in revenues associated with contract operations and maintenance work  primarily work performed for our utility group  as well as increased construction work  and a million increase resulting from the acquisition of a laboratory at the end of the third quarter of and the acquisition of an alabama based contract operations company  offset by a million decrease in revenues related to the construction of a reverse osmosis plant which had been under construction since and was completed during hurricanes katrina and rita affected the gulf coast region of the united states during the third quarter of causing significant damage 
our services group provides contract operations and maintenance services to clients in mississippi and texas  among other states 
the water and wastewater infrastructure for five clients we service in mississippi was disabled by hurricane katrina 
the contracts with our clients provide that we can incur and bill additional expenses during an emergency situation to restore water supply and wastewater treatment services to customers 
in addition  our clients requested we assist with the removal of debris to enable access for emergency vehicles and residents 
we incurred million of overtime labor costs and emergency out of pocket operating expenses related to these emergency recovery efforts for our clients during which are reflected as operating expenses 
we have billed our clients million for these emergency services and we are assisting our clients in requesting reimbursement from the federal emergency management agency fema pursuant to guidelines established in fema s applicant handbook with respect to these costs 
we recognized revenues of million during based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
the million we have billed for these emergency services is reflected in accounts receivable as of december  of which million has been collected as of february in addition  we incurred million of expenses in in support of our employees recovery from the effects of hurricane katrina 
we also incurred less than million of costs related to preparing for hurricane rita  principally temporary infrastructure relocation expenses 
these costs were recorded as an operating expense during and were not reimbursable by fema or recoverable through insurance 
expenses 
expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as follows increase percent of revenues in thousands  except percentage data decrease utility group operating expenses services group operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses total utility group and services group operating expenses are computed as a percent of their respective revenues 
selling general and administrative expenses and total expenses are computed as a percent of total revenues 
utility group operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million for the prior year 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the following a million increase attributable to our acquisition of monarch utilities in mid july  a million increase related to our acquisition of a wastewater treatment facility in alabama at the end of the third quarter of  offset by a million reduction in operating expenses at our california utility resulting from lower production as a result of above average rainfall and cooler temperatures during the year 
operating expenses were and of related revenues for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is caused  in part  by lower operating expenses at our california utility associated with lower water consumption 
the lower consumption enabled us to reduce the amount of water purchased from outside sources  which is generally at prices higher than the cost of water pumped from our own wells 
services group operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million during the same period of the increase in operating expense was due to the following a million increase resulting from higher levels of contract operations and maintenance work  primarily those performed for our utility group  as well as increased construction work  the increase results from increased staffing  fleet expenses and material costs related to the additional contract work  and a million increase resulting from acquisitions in the latter part of and early  offset by a million decrease in construction work related to a reverse osmosis plant  which has been under construction since and was substantially completed as of december  operating expenses as a percentage of the related revenues decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the same period last year 
a majority of the operating expenses for the services group  such as labor and related fringe benefits and service vehicle fleet costs  are fixed in nature 
the high percentage in was due to those fixed costs being absorbed by a lower revenue base 
revenues in were depressed because of higher than normal rainfall which impeded our ability to perform additional construction  operating and maintenance work 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period of selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percent of revenue  remained constant at for the years ended december  and the dollar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the following a million increase attributable to our monarch utilities and other acquisitions which occurred in late and early  a million increase in salaries  wages and related benefits resulting from workforce increases to support our business growth  and a million increase in legal  audit and outside services fees  most of which is attributable to supporting the expanding business base and fill in for temporary shortages in headcount  offset by a million decrease in costs associated with sarbanes oxley act compliance 
other income expense 
other expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as follows in thousands change interest expense interest income gain on sale of land other total interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  during compared to the major components of interest expense are as follows in thousands increase decrease interest expense revolving lines of credit mortgage bonds and bank term loans convertible subordinated debentures other indebtedness total interest incurred less capitalized interest total interest expense the increase in total interest incurred is primarily due to an increase in our long term debt and borrowings on our revolving lines of credit to fund acquisitions and capital spending 
interest on the higher levels of debt were offset  in part  by lower interest payments on our convertible debentures due to the holders electing to convert million of the debentures into common stock and increased capitalization of interest as a result of our increased capital spending 
our average balances of interest bearing debt outstanding were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective weighted average interest rate increased to for the year ended december  from for the prior year 
provision for income taxes 
our effective consolidated income tax rates on combined continuing and discontinued operations were for the years ended december  and  excluding the effect a capital loss as further described below 
during the year ended december  we recognized a capital loss of million for income tax purposes upon the sale of master tek  our discontinued operation 
we will be able to carry back the capital loss to the prior three years and partially offset it against capital gains of million realized during those years 
the remaining million of capital loss will be carried forward to future years to offset any future capital gains 
the capital loss carryforward expires in the million tax benefit of the capital loss carryforward has been fully offset by a valuation allowance as of december  because management does not believe it is more likely than not we will generate future capital gains prior to the expiration date of the loss carryforward 
loss from discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations increased million to for the year ended december  compared to last year 
the increase results from a million increase in the loss from operations in compared to and a million net loss realized on the sale 
the operating loss relates primarily to inventory reserves and higher employee costs associated with retention agreements 
compared to revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  by segment  revenues changed as follows percent of revenues in thousands  except percentage data increase decrease utility group services group total utility group 
revenues increased million  or  to million during from million during the prior year 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to the following a million increase attributable to the july acquisition of monarch utilities  a million increase resulting from rate increases and higher volume sales at our california utility  and a million increase resulting from the favorable effect from an increase in the number of connections at our new mexico and texas utilities  excluding the effect of the monarch acquisition 
services group 
revenues increased million  or  to million from million during the prior year 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to the following a million increase resulting from operations and maintenance contracts which were new in or initiated in the latter part of  including contracts serving the cities of pascagoula  mississippi  santa paula and san simeon  california  as well as monarch utilities  we achieved further revenue growth by increasing billing rates and expanding services under certain existing contracts  a million increase resulting from higher revenues from our environmental lab facility  and a million increase resulting from our subsidiaries that provide state certified water and wastewater laboratory services and government services  some of which were acquired in the latter portion of or during  offset by a million decrease  from million to million  related to the construction of the cvwd reverse osmosis water treatment facility which was substantially completed during and became operational in december our services group was affected by unusually heavy precipitation in  primarily in texas 
heavy rainfall or storm conditions limited our ability to perform billable work such as pipeline maintenance  manhole rehabilitation  construction and other outdoor services 
severe weather conditions also resulted in additional labor and material costs to us as we meet the terms of our operations and maintenance contracts 
we believe that higher than average precipitation limited or delayed our ability to perform billable services and construction during for example  precipitation in the services group s houston base of operations for the years ended december  and was as follows years ended december  of average of average precipitation in inches source houston chronicle expenses 
expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as follows increase percent of revenues in thousands  except percentage data decrease utility group operating expenses services group operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses total utility group and services group operating expenses are computed as a percent of their respective revenues 
selling general and administrative expenses and total expenses are computed as a percent of total revenues 
utility group operating expenses 
operating expenses represented and of utility revenues for and  respectively 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million during from million during the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the following a million increase attributable to the acquisition of monarch utilities in july  a million increase for utility plant maintenance and repair costs  and a million charge related to a doubtful account for a california industrial customer 
the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to increased utility group revenues  which were primarily attributable to an increase in rates at our california utility 
also  the water we sell to our customers is either pumped from our own wells or purchased from outside sources 
costs to produce water from our wells are generally less than our cost to purchase water from outside sources 
a higher portion of the water we sold to our customers was produced from our own wells in the percentage of water used in our operations that was produced from our own wells was and during and  respectively  at our california utility 
this increase in water production related to two new wells that were placed in service in april and october of the aggregate average cost of purchased and produced water in california was and per acre foot in and  respectively 
the impact of the monarch utilities acquisition partially offset the lower california water costs 
operating expenses as a percentage of revenues are higher for monarch utilities than for our california  new mexico and other texas utilities

operating expenses represented and of revenues for and  respectively 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million during from million during the increase was due primarily to the following a million increase in operating expenses incurred by subsidiaries established or acquired in the latter portion of or during that provide state certified water and wastewater laboratory services and government services  a million increase due to costs to provide services under certain significant contracts with the cities of pascagoula  santa paula and san simeon  as well as monarch utilities  which were new in or initiated in the latter portion of  a million increase related to increased business at our environmental lab facility  a million increase related to a loss accrual for the virginia beach wastewater collection system rehabilitation project and the write off of related uncollectible construction receivables  and a decrease in construction costs  to million from million  for the reverse osmosis water treatment facility in california that was substantially completed during services group operating expenses  as a percent of revenues  increased from in to in many of our services group contracts contain annual contractual price increases tied to national consumer price indices 
we believe that these consumer price indices may not fully reflect the inflation in key costs in our services group  such as salaries and wages for our skilled workforce  employee health insurance costs  general liability and workers compensation insurance costs and fuel costs for our vehicles 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or  to million for from million during the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to a million increase due to our efforts to prepare for and comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations  a million increase due to increases in professional fees  facilities costs  and labor and benefits costs for administrative employees  a million increase attributable to monarch utilities since its acquisition in july  a million increase due to executive separation and retention charges  a million increase due to a charge for doubtful receivables related to a strategic development partnership  and a million increase for increased new business development costs associated with the research of potential new projects

our average balances of long term debt outstanding were million and million for and  respectively 
this increase in our average debt was primarily driven by debt incurred in our acquisition of monarch utilities 
in addition  our weighted average borrowing rates increased to during from during gain on sales of land 
we recognized a million pretax gain on sales of surplus land in we recognized a million pretax gain on the sale of surplus land in provision for income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources our overall objectives with respect to liquidity and capital resources are to generate sufficient operating cash flows to service our debt and tax obligations  fund capital improvements and organic growth  and pay dividends to our stockholders  utilize our credit facility for major capital improvements and to manage seasonal cash needs  obtain external financing for major acquisitions  and maintain approximately equal levels of debt and equity consistent with the investor owned water utility industry 
our statements of cash flows are summarized as follows years ended december  increase in thousands decrease net cash provided by used in continuing operations operating activities investing activities financing activities total continuing operations discontinued operations operating activities investing activities financing activities total discontinued operations increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million in compared to the prior year 
operational aspects of our businesses that affected working capital in versus are highlighted below increased revenues generated by our utility group  resulting from the monarch utilities acquisition in july and customer connection growth in new mexico and texas  the benefit from increased water rates at our california utility  and favorable weather conditions for both our utility and services group 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in compared to million during as follows years ended december  increase in thousands decrease cash flows used in provided by investing activities additions to property  plant and equipment acquisition of businesses  net of cash acquired proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations purchase of minority interest other net cash used for investing activities the following table summarizes additions to property  plant and equipment additions for and years ended december  in thousands company financed additions capital improvement reimbursements cash contributions received in aid of construction total cash additions to property  plant and equipment non cash contributions in aid of construction total additions to property  plant and equipment capital projects primarily relate to the expansion  replacement and renovation of our water and wastewater systems  particularly at our texas and new mexico utilities 
contributions in aid of construction ciac represent contributions in the form of cash  services or property received from developers  governmental agencies  municipalities or individuals for the purpose of constructing utility plant and is not refundable 
in  we expect to spend approximately million on cash additions  principally within our utility group  and expect to receive million of ciac resulting in total expected additions to property  plant and equipment of about million 
we also made substantial investments in acquisitions during and and expect we will continue to do so in the future 
in addition  in december we acquired the minority interest in windermere utility company that we did not already own pursuant to a shareholder agreement we entered into in when we acquired our ownership interest 
pursuant to the agreement  we acquired the interest by issuing  shares of our common stock with an aggregate market value of million to the minority stockholder in exchange for the remaining shares 
because this was a non cash  stock for stock exchange  the transaction is deemed to be a non cash investing and financing activity 
cash flows from financing activities 
during  we financed our growth through a broad range of capital initiatives entered into a new  five year  million revolving line of credit  which replaced three separate lines of credit with an aggregate borrowing capacity of million that was due to expire in issued million of term loan due in and used the proceeds to repay credit facility borrowings  and received million of proceeds from our direct stock purchase plan  our employee stock purchase and option plans and our director option plan 
aggregate borrowings under our revolving lines of credit increased by a net million during compared to primarily due to our acquisition activities 
our borrowing availability under our credit facility was million as of december  during  we paid dividends totaling million and our quarterly dividend rate is currently per common share 
we also financed the acquisition of the minority interest in windermere utility company that we did not already own by issuing  shares of our common stock with an aggregate market value of million to the minority stockholder in exchange for the remaining shares 
because this was a non cash  stock for stock exchange  the transaction is deemed to be a non cash investing and financing activity 
cash flows from discontinued operations 
net cash used in discontinued operations was million during compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is caused by several acquisitions during that were structured as asset purchases in which we paid million in cash 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our known contractual obligations to make future cash payments as of december   as well as an estimate of the periods during which these payments are expected to be made 
years ended december  in thousands total and and and beyond long term debt bank line of credit mortgage bonds bank term loans convertible subordinated debentures economic development revenue bonds notes payable total long term debt repayment of advances for construction lease assignment obligations operating lease obligations total obligations as of december  excludes interest payments  which are described in the following notes 
the terms of the long term debt are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the bank lines of credit bear interest at variable rates and therefore the amount of future interest payments are uncertain 
borrowings bear interest  at our option  based on a margin either a over the libor rate  or b under the prime rate 
the margins vary based on our consolidated debt to equity ratio 
the weighted average interest rate on our bank line of credit borrowings was as of december  interest on the mortgage bonds is fixed at a weighted average annual interest rate of and is payable semiannually 
interest on the bank term loans is fixed at a weighted average annual interest rate of and is payable semiannually 
interest on the convertible debentures is fixed at a annual rate and is payable quarterly 
the debentures are convertible  at the option of the holder  into shares of our common stock at any time prior to their maturity 
interest on the economic development bonds is fixed at a weighted average annual interest rate of and is payable semiannually 
interest is payable either monthly or quarterly at rates ranging from to per year 
advances for construction are non interest bearing 
interest on the lease assignment obligations is fixed at a weighted average interest rate of and is payable monthly 
financial condition and liquidity as of december   we had working capital of approximately million and million of additional borrowings available under our line of credit facility which expires on april  in addition to our line of credit  our california and new mexico mortgage bond indentures permit the issuance of an additional million of first mortgage bonds as of december  however  the terms of our credit facility do not permit additional first mortgage bond indebtedness without prior consent from the credit facility lenders 
the mortgage bond indentures also limit the amount of cash and property dividends our california and new mexico utilities may pay to the parent company to fund its payment obligations 
dividends have averaged to million per year and are less than the aggregate cumulative dividend restriction threshold by million as of december  we also have on file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  which is effective for the issuance of up to million aggregate principal amount of common stock  debt securities and warrants 
to date we have issued approximately million of common stock under the shelf registration  and about million remains available for issuance as of december  we may offer any of these securities for sale at any time and from time to time 
as of december   we have contractual obligations totaling million  million of which is due during we were in compliance with all loan agreement covenants during the year ended december  we have million of mortgage bonds maturing in which we expect we will be able to refinance through the sale of new mortgage bonds or retire with funds borrowed under our credit facility 
we believe that our expected operating cash flows  together with borrowings under our credit facility million of which was available as of december  and expires on april  will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses  working capital and capital expenditure requirements as well as our debt service obligations for the next twelve months 
however  our ability to comply with debt financial covenants  pay principal or interest and refinance our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance as well as competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
certain contractual commitments and indemnities in  we were retained to facilitate the engineering and construction of a million reverse osmosis water treatment plant in the city of san juan capistrano  california for the capistrano valley water district cvwd 
in  we obtained a million standby letter of credit as collateral to insure our performance during the design and construction of the water treatment plant 
construction was completed during and upon final acceptance of the completed project by the cvwd  which is expected in  the standby letter of credit will be terminated 
we now operate the completed plant under a twenty year operating agreement 
the cvwd service contract contains certain guarantees related to our performance  including certain liquidated damages in the event of failure on our part to perform not caused by uncontrollable circumstances as defined in the service contract 
during the twenty year term  we may be liable for liquidated damages relating to any lost payments from an agreement with a state water agency providing financial assistance to cvwd 
also  we have made other guarantees to cvwd  including guarantees with respect to the quality and quantity of the finished water and the production efficiency of the facility 
as part of the financing for this project  the cvwd sold insured municipal bonds 
we entered into an agreement with the bond insurer to guarantee our performance under the service contract  subject to certain liability caps to the bond insurer in the event of a default 
during the twenty year operation of the facility  such liability caps will not exceed an amount equal to million plus an amount no greater than the replacement cost of the actual reverse osmosis filtration unit within the facility  estimated to be approximately million 
we had irrevocable standby letters of credit in the amount of million issued and outstanding under our credit facility  including the cvwd letter of credit described above as of december  during our normal course of business  we have entered into agreements containing indemnities pursuant to which we may be required to make payments in the future 
these indemnities are in connection with facility leases and liabilities and operations and maintenance and construction contracts entered into by our services group 
the duration of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees varies  and in certain cases  is indefinite 
substantially all of these indemnities provide no limitation on the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make and is not quantifiable 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities 
in connection with the sale of master tek  we made indemnities to the buyer with respect to a number of customary  and certain other specific  representations and warranties 
our indemnities with respect to these matters are limited in terms of duration to periods ranging from one year to the expiration of the applicable statue of limitations 
as of december   we have million of reserves provided for warranty repairs obligations and potentially uncollectible accounts receivable 
we believe those reserves are adequate and we have not recorded any additional liabilities for other indemnities since no claims have been asserted to date 
off balance sheet arrangements through the date of this report  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our subsidiaries 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates and judgments are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made and they are evaluated and updated on an ongoing basis 
to the extent our estimates and judgments are different than actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following are the more critical accounting policies we use in preparing our financial statements and are important to fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial position and results of operations 
accounting for regulated businesses our regulated businesses  which include our utilities in california  new mexico  and texas  are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which specifies certain revenue  expense and balance sheet treatment as required by each state s regulatory authority 
each state authority establishes rates which are intended to permit each utility to recover its costs and earn a reasonable rate of return 
our services group has contracted with our utilities in texas  and new mexico to perform operating services  maintenance  construction work  and to manage capital projects 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our services group recognizes profit on sales to regulated affiliates and does not eliminate the intercompany profit when the sales price is reasonable and it is probable that  through the rate making process  future revenue approximately equal to the sales price will result from the regulated affiliate s use of the services 
however  all revenue in excess of profit is eliminated 
accordingly  the intercompany profit for construction as well as operations and maintenance services provided to utility group affiliates has not been eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
based upon our services group s experience of providing operations and maintenance services in more than contracts with unaffiliated customers  and a history of regulator approval of the construction service fees charged by the services group to utility affiliates  we believe that the contract sales prices between our services group and our texas and new mexico utilities are reasonable and that it is probable that the price of these services will be recovered in the rate making process 
in  our california water utility recorded a balancing account receivable in the amount of million  representing the difference between actual water production costs incurred and cpuc adopted water production costs 
historically  the cpuc allowed such balancing accounts in the income statements of water utilities  with a corresponding liability or asset on the balance sheet 
on july   the cpuc issued a decision that allows our water utility in california to collect the million balancing account and an additional under collection of million for a total of million 
the million increase in the balancing account receivable was recorded in the third quarter of the cpuc decision provides for us to recover the settlement amount through a surcharge billed to customers 
approximately million of the additional amount was recorded as a reduction in operating expenses in the third quarter of  and the remaining million was recorded as interest income 
as of december   our california water utility has collected million of the balancing account receivable and million is outstanding as of december  revenue recognition water utility revenues are recognized when water is delivered to customers 
at the end of an accounting period  estimated amounts for unbilled revenues are accrued for water usage since the previous billing period 
revenues for contract operations are recognized and billed at the end of the month based on a monthly fee to provide a specific level of service as outlined in each individual contract 
we generally bill for additional services provided beyond the scope of the base contract on a time and materials basis as such services are rendered 
revenues for construction projects for unaffiliated third parties are recorded using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue and income as work progresses on a project based on the expected total project costs and the expected total project revenues 
we estimate the percentage of completion using total contract price  actual costs incurred to date and an estimate of the completion costs for each contract 
revenues for construction projects for utilities within our utility group are recorded using the completed contract method of accounting under which all revenues and costs are recognized upon completion of the project 
if management anticipates we will ultimately suffer a loss on a construction project  the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period such a determination is made 
if a contract involves the provision of a single product or service  revenue is generally recognized when the product or service is provided and the amount becomes billable 
if services are provided evenly during the contract term but service billings are irregular  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
certain non refundable activation fees in our non regulated wholesale water operations are recognized over the expected period of performance 
if a contract involves the provision of multiple products or services elements  total estimated contract revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each service  provided the services qualify for separation under emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amount of revenue allocated to each service is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another element in the future 
revenue is then recognized for each element as described above for single element contracts  except revenue recognized on a straight line basis for a non construction service will not exceed amounts currently billable unless the excess revenue is recoverable from the client upon any contract termination event 
if the amount of revenue allocated to a construction service is less than its relative fair value  costs to deliver such service  limited to the difference between allocated revenue and the relative fair value  are deferred and amortized over the contract term 
if total construction service costs are estimated to exceed the relative fair value for the construction service contained in a multiple element arrangement  then a provision for the estimated loss is made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess intangible assets and other long lived assets  excluding goodwill  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or other long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure impairment by using the projected discounted cash flow method in accordance with sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when events or circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using discounted cash flow methodologies  transaction values for comparable companies  and other valuation techniques for all of our reporting units with goodwill balances  we do not have any indefinite lived intangible assets 
when sfas no 
was issued in  we adopted december st of each year as our annual impairment testing date 
since  we have completed several acquisitions which resulted in goodwill being recorded with each requiring annually impairment testing 
in  we elected to change our annual impairment testing date october st of each year  commencing october  moving the testing date to october st will allow management more time to accurately complete its impairment testing process in order to incorporate the results in our annual financial statements and timely file those statements with the securities exchange commission in accordance with its accelerated filing requirements 
there were no impairment charges resulting from the october  impairment testing and no events have occurred subsequent to that date which indicates impairment may have occurred 
stock based compensation in  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which requires valuation of stock options issued based upon an option pricing model and recognition of this value as an expense over the period in which the options vest 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we elected to recognize stock based compensation using the retroactive restatement method 
under this change in accounting method  we restated our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to to reflect stock based compensation expense under a fair value based accounting method for all options granted  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  we use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
this option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that do not have vesting restrictions and that are fully transferable 
option valuation models require subjective assumptions such as the expected future volatility of the stock price 
because the stock options we grant have characteristics that are significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the calculated results  in management s opinion  the stock option valuation models  including black scholes  may not necessarily provide an exact measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
deferred costs we defer and subsequently amortize certain direct contract acquisition costs related to activities that enable the provision of contracted services to our customers 
deferred contract acquisition costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining original contract term unless revenue patterns indicate a more accelerated method is appropriate 
the recoverability of all long lived assets associated with a particular contract  including deferred contract costs  is analyzed on a periodic basis 
if we conclude that long lived assets are impaired  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no

sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
and supercedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
generally  sfas no 
r is similar in approach to sfas no 
and requires that compensation cost relating to share based payments be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we will adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal since we adopted sfas no 
in  we expect the adoption of sfas no 
r will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which is a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  although it carries forward some of their provisions 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also redefines the term restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in our fiscal years beginning january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had million of long term variable and fixed rate debt 
we are exposed to market risk based on changes in prevailing interest rates 
market risk related to our variable rate debt is estimated as the potential decrease in pre tax earnings resulting from an increase in interest rates 
we have million of long term debt that bears interest at variable rates based on either the prime rate or libor rate 
our variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  a hypothetical one percent basis points increase in the average interest rates charged on our variable rate debt would reduce our pre tax earnings by approximately million per year 
our fixed rate debt  which has a carrying value of million  has a fair value of million as of december  market risk related to our fixed rate debt is deemed to be the potential increase in fair value resulting from a decrease in prevailing interest rates 
our fixed rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  a hypothetical ten percent decrease in interest rates  from to  would increase the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce these risks although we may do so in the future
