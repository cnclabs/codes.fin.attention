table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
during fiscal  the company experienced first a slowing in the rate of growth in sales in its company stores segment and  later in the year  declines in sales compared to the comparable periods of fiscal these sales declines continued in fiscal systemwide and company average weekly sales per factory store which includes sales through satellites decreased approximately and  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased approximately and  respectively  in fiscal compared to fiscal the lower company average weekly sales per factory store had a disproportionately higher adverse impact on company store profitability due to the significant fixed or semi fixed costs inherent in operating the company s stores 
in response to the declining sales  the company closed factory stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal lower sales in stores operated by franchisees resulted in reduced sales of mixes  icings and fillings  sugar  shortening  coffee and supplies by kkm d  and resulted in lower royalty revenues in the franchise segment 
certain franchisees have experienced financial difficulties and  as a result  the company recorded bad debt provisions of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal related to its receivables from franchisees 
the company also recorded impairment charges and lease termination costs in income from continuing operations of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company was also significantly affected by the substantial costs associated with the legal and regulatory matters discussed in item  business  and item  legal proceedings  of this annual report on form k 
company overview and industry outlook the company s principal business  which began in  is owning and franchising krispy kreme doughnut stores which make and sell over varieties of high quality doughnuts  including the company s hot original glazed tm 
each of the company s traditional factory stores has a doughnut making production line and the capacity to produce from  dozen to over  dozen doughnuts daily 
consequently  each factory store has significant fixed or semi fixed costs  and margins and profitability are significantly affected by doughnut production volume and sales 
factory stores are versatile in that most can support multiple sales channels to more fully utilize production capacity 
these sales channels are comprised of on premises sales 
sales to customers visiting company and franchise stores  including the drive through windows  along with discounted sales to community organizations that in turn sell doughnuts for fundraising purposes 
off premises sales 
daily sales of fresh doughnuts primarily on a branded basis to a variety of retail customers  such as supermarkets  convenience stores  mass merchants and other food service and institutional accounts 
doughnuts are sold to these customers on trays for display and sale in glass enclosed cases and in packages for display and sale on both stand alone display units and on customers shelves 
in addition  the company also sells branded packaged coffee and other products to select supermarkets  convenience stores and mass merchants 
the company is vertically integrated to help maintain the consistency and quality of products throughout the krispy kreme system 
in addition  through vertical integration  the company utilizes volume buying power  which the company believes helps lower the cost of supplies to stores and enhances profitability 
the krispy kreme manufacturing and distribution business unit  kkm d  produces doughnut mixes and coffee and manufactures doughnut making equipment  which all factory stores are required to purchase 
additionally  this business unit operates three distribution centers that are capable of supplying domestic stores and certain international stores with key supplies 
this business unit is volume driven  and its economics are enhanced by the opening of new stores and the growth of sales by existing stores 
one of the company s focus areas has been improving its beverage program to complement the company s doughnut offerings 
the company has implemented in the majority of its stores a complete 
table of contents beverage program  including drip coffees  a complete line of espresso based coffees including flavors and both coffee based and noncoffee based frozen drinks 
the company s stores include factory stores and satellite stores 
traditional factory stores have the capacity to produce from  dozen to over  dozen doughnuts daily 
commissaries  which are production facilities used principally to serve off premises customers domestically and to supplement factory stores focused on on premises sales internationally  have the highest production capacities of factory stores 
as of january   there were commissaries systemwide  five of which were operated by the company 
other factory stores often engage in both on premises and off premises sales  with the allocation between such channels dependent on the particular capacity of the store 
the company has begun introducing internationally  and on a test basis domestically  a store concept that will utilize doughnut making technology scaled to accommodate principally on premises sales in a store approximately one half the size of a traditional factory store 
satellite stores consist primarily of the fresh shop  kiosk and tunnel oven store formats 
tunnel oven stores contain doughnut heating technology that allows customers to have a hot doughnut experience throughout the day 
fresh shops and free standing kiosks are locations that do not contain doughnut heating technology 
in each of these formats  the company typically sells fresh doughnuts  beverages and krispy kreme collectibles  with the doughnuts supplied by nearby factory stores 
each of these formats requires less space than a traditional factory store 
the company began tests of the fresh shop concept during fiscal and tests of the tunnel oven store and kiosk formats in fiscal as of january   fresh shops  tunnel oven stores and kiosks were open 
the company views the fresh shop  tunnel oven store and kiosk formats as additional ways to achieve market penetration in a variety of market sizes and settings 
as of january   there were krispy kreme factory stores  consisting of company stores including owned by glazed investments  a consolidated franchisee until february  area developer franchise stores including owned by franchisees in which the company had a minority equity interest and associate franchise stores 
the company is working to stabilize its operations and to refine its store format for new domestic factory stores  and does not expect that the company or its franchisees will open a significant number of domestic stores in the near future 
it is likely that the company will close some additional domestic factory stores 
the company is hiring personnel to assist in the development of international markets 
as of january   there were a total of krispy kreme stores operated internationally  located in australia  canada  mexico  south korea and the united kingdom 
as of january   the company owned six stores in canada and had an equity interest in the franchisees operating the stores in mexico and the united kingdom and one store in canada 
the company currently does not expect to own equity interests in any international area developers formed in the future 
based on continued research and experience with international stores  the company is focusing international development efforts primarily on opportunities in potential markets in asia  the middle east and western europe 
subsequent to january   the company signed agreements awarding development rights to franchisees in the middle east  hong kong  macau  tokyo  the philippines and indonesia 
the development and franchise agreements for these territories provide for the development of approximately stores over the next five years 
as the company expands its business  management expects to incur infrastructure costs in the form of additional personnel to support the expansion and additional facilities costs to provide mixes  equipment and other items necessary to operate new stores 
in the course of building this infrastructure  the company may incur unplanned costs which could negatively impact the company s operating results 
the domestic doughnut market is comprised of several sales channels including retail  grocery store packaged  in store bakeries within grocery stores  convenience stores  business and institutional  fundraising and vending 
comprehensive  reliable doughnut industry statistics are not readily available  however  with regard to specific sales channels within the industry  data is available 
information resources  inc data indicate that  during calendar  packaged and in store bakery doughnut sales through domestic grocery stores decreased and through domestic convenience stores increased

company stores revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in revenues reflects a decrease in average weekly sales per store and a decrease in store operating weeks 
the decrease in average weekly sales per store is attributable principally to lower volumes  and reflects relatively greater weakness in sales through off premises sales channels than in on premises sales 
off premises sales were affected by price reductions on certain products 
the number of operating weeks declined due to the closure of relatively poorly performing locations 
franchise revenues 
franchise revenues  consisting principally of franchise fees and royalties  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decline in franchise revenues reflects a decrease in royalty revenues resulting from lower sales by franchises in fiscal compared to fiscal and  to a lesser extent  reduced initial franchise fees due to fewer store openings in fiscal compared to the prior year 
in addition  the company did not recognize as revenue approximately million of uncollected royalties which accrued during fiscal because the company did not believe collection of these royalties was reasonably assured 
sales by franchise stores  as reported by the franchisees  were approximately million in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal kkm d revenues 
kkm d sales to franchise stores decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal lower sales at franchise stores resulted in decreased sales of mixes  icings and fillings  sugar  shortening  coffee and supplies by kkm d

franchise direct operating expenses 
franchise direct operating expenses include costs to recruit new franchisees  costs to open  monitor and aid in the performance of franchise stores and direct general and administrative expenses 
franchise direct operating expenses as a percentage of franchise revenues decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  primarily due to reduced provisions for uncollectible receivables and a reduction in corporate cost allocations arising from cost reductions in certain categories which are allocated  in part  to the franchise segment

exclusive of these costs  general and administrative expenses were approximately of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal among the more significant reductions in general and administrative expenses in fiscal compared to the preceding year were reductions of approximately million in executive compensation  benefits and travel  and approximately million in the cost of corporate aircraft 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal from million  or of total revenues  in fiscal the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense relates almost entirely to the company stores segment  in which depreciation and amortization expense declined principally due to store closures

the goodwill impairment charges reflect reductions in the company s forecasted sales and earnings in the reporting units comprising the company stores segment 
the fair values of those reporting units are estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows 
the decline in goodwill impairment charges was partially offset by an increase in impairment charges related principally to long lived assets  which rose to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  principally due to an increased number of store closing and other disposal decisions in fiscal compared to fiscal settlement of litigation on october   the company agreed to settle a federal securities class action and to settle  in part  certain shareholder derivative actions  as more fully described in item  legal proceedings  and note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein

the company has charged a provision for the settlement of million against fiscal earnings  representing the estimated fair value of the common stock and warrants to be issued by the company 
the provision for settlement costs will be adjusted to reflect changes in the fair value of the securities until they are issued following final court approval of the settlement  which the company anticipates will occur in late calendar or early calendar interest income interest income was million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the increase principally reflects higher interest rates earned on invested balances in fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the aggregate costs  including interest  fees and amortization of deferred debt issuance costs  associated with the company s primary credit facilities the secured credit facilities and  prior to april   a bank credit facility which was retired using proceeds of the secured credit facilities increased approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal of the million increase  approximately million reflects higher outstanding debt balances  interest rates  lender margin and transaction costs in fiscal compared to fiscal  the remainder of the increase consists principally of one time fees and expenses associated with the bank credit facility prior to its retirement using proceeds of the secured credit facility 
in addition  interest expense in fiscal includes the write off of approximately  of unamortized financing costs associated with the retired bank financing and approximately  charged to earnings upon termination of an interest rate hedge related to the retired bank financing 
interest expense associated with consolidated franchisees declined approximately  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the deconsolidation of kremeko

these sales declines continued in fiscal  during which the company s revenues declined to million from million in fiscal  reflecting  among other things  lower revenues at kkm d  store closures including closures by consolidated franchisees and lower revenues at remaining stores 
these trends adversely affected operating margins because of the fixed or semi fixed nature of many of the company s direct operating expenses 
in addition  litigation has been commenced against the company and certain current and former officers and directors  and investigations of the company have been initiated by the securities and exchange commission the commission and the united states attorney for the southern district of new york  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
in october  the company s board of directors appointed a special committee to conduct an independent investigation of certain matters  including accounting matters

in january  the company s chairman  president and chief executive officer retired  and the board of directors engaged kzc  a corporate recovery and advisory firm  to provide interim executive management services to the company 
since that time  the company has undertaken a number of initiatives designed to improve the company s operating results and financial position 
such initiatives include closing a substantial number of underperforming stores  reducing corporate overhead and other costs to bring them more in line with the company s current level of operations  recruiting new management personnel for certain positions  obtaining the secured credit facilities described below under capital resources  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements  restructuring certain financial arrangements associated with franchisees in which the company has an ownership interest and with respect to which the company has financial guarantee obligations and selling certain non strategic assets 
in addition to the foregoing  a committee of the company s board of directors conducted a search for a new chief executive officer to lead the company on a permanent basis 
on march   the company 
table of contents announced the appointment  effective immediately  of a new chief executive officer having over years experience in the food industry and with particular experience in consumer packaged goods 
while the company believes that these actions have enhanced the likelihood that the company will be able to improve its business  the company remains subject to a number of risks  many of which are not within the control of the company 
among the more significant of those risks are pending litigation and governmental investigations  the outcome of which cannot be predicted  the costs of defending such litigation and cooperating with such investigations  and the magnitude of indemnification expenses which the company will incur under indemnification provisions of north carolina law  the company s bylaws and certain indemnification agreements 
any of these risks could cause the company s operations to fail to improve or to continue to erode 
in order to fund its business and potential indemnification obligations  including the payment of legal expenses  the company is dependent upon its ability to generate cash from operations and continued access to external financing 
the company s principal source of external financing is its secured credit facilities 
these facilities contain significant financial and other covenants  as described below under capital resources  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
failure to generate sufficient earnings to comply with these financial covenants  or the occurrence or failure to occur of certain events  would cause the company to default under the secured credit facilities 
in the absence of a waiver of  or forbearance with respect to  any such default from the company s lenders  the company could be obligated to repay outstanding indebtedness under the facilities  and the company s ability to access additional borrowings under the facilities would be restricted 
the facilities contain covenants which limit the total indebtedness of the company and limit the company s ability to obtain borrowings under the facilities  as described below under capital resources  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements 
the company believes that it will have sufficient access to credit under the secured credit facilities to continue the restructuring of the company s business  and that it will be able to comply with the covenants contained in such facilities 
the financial covenants contained in such facilities are based upon the company s fiscal operating plan and preliminary plans for fiscal  which include  among other things  anticipated sales of certain assets and reductions in the amount of indebtedness and other obligations of franchisees guaranteed by the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to comply with the financial and other covenants in these facilities 
in the event the company were to fail to comply with one or more such covenants  the company would attempt to negotiate waivers of any such noncompliance 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to negotiate any such waivers  and the costs or conditions associated with any such waivers could be significant 
in the event that credit under the secured credit facilities were not available to the company  there can be no assurance that alternative sources of credit will be available to the company or  if they are available  under what terms or at what cost 
until such time as the company is current in filing with the commission all periodic reports required to be filed by the company under the exchange act  the company will not be able to obtain capital by issuing any security whose registration would be required under the securities act 
shortly after the filing of this annual report on form k  the company expects to file its quarterly reports on form q for the first  second and third quarters of fiscal however  the company has not filed its quarterly reports on form q for the third quarter of fiscal or for the first or second quarter of fiscal while the company is working diligently to complete the filings referred to in the preceding sentence focusing first on the fiscal reports and then on the third quarter fiscal report  there can be no assurance as to when the company will be current in its reporting obligations 
capital resources  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in addition to cash flow generated from operations  the company utilizes other capital resources and financing arrangements to fund the expansion of the krispy kreme concept 
these other resources and arrangements have assumed increased importance in light of the substantially reduced cash flows provided by operations 
a discussion of these capital resources and financing techniques is included below 

table of contents debt the company continuously monitors its funding requirements for general working capital purposes and other financing and investing activities 
in fiscal  the company also provided financing to consolidated franchisees 
in fiscal  management focused on reducing or eliminating our investments in franchisees and the related guarantees of franchisee s obligations  and on restructuring the company s borrowing arrangements to make additional credit available to the company to facilitate accomplishing the company s business restructuring initiatives 
on april   the company closed new secured credit facilities totaling million collectively  the secured credit facilities 
kkdc is the borrower under each of the secured credit facilities  and kkdi and certain of its domestic subsidiaries are guarantors 
the facilities consist of a million revolving credit facility maturing april   secured by a first lien on substantially all of the assets of kkdc and the guarantors the first lien revolver  and a million credit facility maturing april   secured by a second lien on those assets the second lien facility 
the second lien facility consists of a million term loan the term loan and a million revolving credit facility the second lien revolver 
at closing  the company borrowed the full million available under the term loan  and used the proceeds to retire approximately million of indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility which was then terminated and to pay fees and expenses associated with the secured credit facilities 
the balance of the term loan proceeds were retained for general corporate purposes 
both the first lien revolver and the second lien revolver contain provisions which permit the company to obtain letters of credit 
issuance of letters of credit under these provisions constitutes usage of the lending commitments  and the amount of such letters of credit reduces the amount available for cash borrowings under the related revolver 
on the closing date  the company obtained approximately million of letters of credit the backstop lcs under the second lien revolver  which were issued to secure the company s reimbursement obligations relating to letters of credit issued under the credit facility  and a new letter of credit of million to secure obligations to one of the company s banks 
the letters of credit issued under the credit facility the majority of which secured the company s obligations under self insured worker s compensation insurance policies subsequently were replaced with new letters of credit issued under the second lien revolver  and the corresponding backstop lcs were terminated

in addition  the first lien revolver is required to be repaid on a daily basis to the extent the company s net liquidity as defined in the first lien revolver is below million 
mandatory repayments under the first lien revolver do not reduce commitments under the first lien revolver 
net proceeds are generally required to be first applied to repay amounts outstanding under the first lien revolver and then without giving effect to the amount repaid under the first lien revolver to be offered to the holders of the term loan 
to the extent application of these mandatory prepayment provisions results in prepayment of amounts outstanding under the term loan  such prepaid amounts cannot be reborrowed  and any such prepayments are not subject to the prepayment fees described in the following paragraph 
the company may permanently reduce the commitments under both the first lien revolver and the second lien revolver 
the company must pay a fee of of the amount of any such reduction of the commitments under the first lien revolver which occurs before august  the company may not reduce the commitments under the second lien revolver until august  the company must pay a fee of of the amount of any such reduction which occurs on or before august   such fee declines to on august   to on august  and to zero on august  the company has not reduced the commitments under either the first lien revolver or the second lien revolver

leases the company conducts some of its operations from leased facilities and leases certain equipment 
generally  these leases have initial terms of three to twenty years and contain provisions for renewal options of five to ten years 
in determining whether to enter into a lease for an asset  the company evaluates the nature of the asset and the associated lease terms to determine if leasing is an effective financing tool 
off balance sheet arrangements the company s only off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by item a of sec regulation s k  consist of the company s guarantees of indebtedness and lease obligations of certain franchisees  as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein  and certain advancement and potential indemnification obligations also discussed in note contractual cash obligations at january  the company s contractual cash obligations as of january  are as follows payments due in less more than than total amount year years years years in thousands long term debt excluding capital lease obligations  including current maturities total interest payment obligations capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations reflected on krispy kreme s balance sheet including current portion self insurance claims lease termination costs mirror k plan liability total represents estimated interest payments to be made on long term debt

capital requirements in the next five years  the company plans to use cash primarily for the following activities working capital and other corporate purposes investments in systems and personnel restructuring initiatives remodeling and relocation of selected older company stores opening new company stores in selected markets the company s capital requirements for the items outlined above may be significant 
these capital requirements will depend on many factors including the company s overall performance  the pace of store expansion and company store remodels and infrastructure needs for both personnel and facilities 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations in recent years 
the company cannot predict  however  what effect inflation may have on its results of operations in the future 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures  including disclosures of contingencies and uncertainties 
gaap provides the framework from which to make these estimates  assumptions and disclosures 
the company chooses accounting policies within gaap that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report the company s operating results and financial position in a consistent manner 
management regularly assesses these policies in light of changes in facts and circumstances and discusses the selection of accounting policies and significant accounting judgments with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the company believes that application of the following accounting policies involves judgments and estimates that are among the more significant used in the preparation of the financial statements  and that an understanding of these policies is important to understanding the company s financial condition and results of operations 
basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of kkdi and all subsidiaries where voting control rests with the company  as well as the accounts of certain franchisees that are variable interest entities and with respect to which the company has determined that variable interests owned by the company absorb a majority of each entity s expected losses  expected residual returns  or both  as each of these terms is defined in financial accounting interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
investments in franchisees over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  and whose financial statements are not required to be consolidated under fin r  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
management s judgments regarding the company s level of influence or control over each franchisee in which it has an investment and the extent to which variable interests owned by the company absorb a majority of the franchisee s expected losses or expected residual returns affect management s decisions about which investments are consolidated and which are accounted for using the equity method 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable arise primarily from royalties earned on sales by the company s franchisees  sales by kkm d to our franchisees of equipment  mix  coffee and other supplies necessary to operate a krispy kreme store  as well as from off premises sales by company stores to convenience and grocery stores and other customers 
during fiscal and  some of the company s franchisees experienced financial difficulties or for other reasons did not comply with the normal payment terms for settlement of amounts due to the company 
the company has recorded provisions for doubtful accounts related to its accounts receivable  including receivables from franchisees  in amounts which management believes are sufficient to provide for losses estimated to be sustained on realization of these receivables 
such estimates inherently involve uncertainties and assessments of the outcome of future events  and changes in facts and circumstances may result in adjustments to the provision for doubtful accounts 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets fas  goodwill and other intangible assets fas  addresses the accounting and reporting of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
fas requires intangible assets with definite lives to be amortized over their estimated useful lives  while those with indefinite lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization but must be tested annually for impairment  or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate potential impairment 
goodwill arose principally from acquisitions of franchisees and from the acquisition of montana mills in fiscal identifiable intangible assets include the value assigned to recipes and reacquired franchise rights recorded in connection with franchise acquisitions 
reacquired franchise rights were determined to have indefinite lives based upon the long operating history of the company s brand and its franchise model  and the company s ability to enfranchise these markets 
all of the intangibles associated with montana mills were written off in fiscal when the company decided to discontinue the montana mills operation 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives  the company performs the annual test for impairment as of december the impairment test involves determining the fair values of the reporting units to which goodwill is assigned and comparing those fair values to the reporting units carrying values  including goodwill 
to determine fair value for each reporting unit  the company uses the fair value of the cash flows that the reporting unit can be expected to generate in the future 
this valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multiyear period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
significant management judgment is involved in preparing these estimates 
changes in projections or estimates could significantly change the estimated fair value of reporting units and affect the recorded balances of goodwill 
in addition  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  future operating results and the balances of goodwill in the future could be affected by impairment charges 
impairment analyses of goodwill in fiscal and resulted in impairment charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of january   the remaining goodwill had a carrying value of million 
asset impairment when an asset group typically a store is identified as underperforming or when a decision is made to abandon an asset group or to close a store  the company makes an assessment of the potential impairment of the related assets 
the assessment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets  primarily property and equipment  to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from those assets 
to estimate cash flows  management projects the net cash flows anticipated from continuing operation of the asset group or store until its closing or abandonment  as well as cash flows  if any  anticipated from disposal of the related assets 
if the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows  the company records an impairment charge in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their estimated fair value 
determining undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of an asset group involves estimating future cash flows  revenues  operating expenses and disposal values 
the projections of these amounts represent management s best estimates at the time of the review 
if different cash flows had been estimated  property and 
table of contents equipment balances and related impairment charges could have been affected 
further  if management uses different assumptions or estimates in the future or if conditions exist in future periods that are different than those anticipated  future operating results could be affected 
in fiscal and  the company recorded impairment charges related to long lived assets totaling approximately and million  respectively 
the company anticipates that additional impairment charges will be reflected in fiscal related to store closure decisions made during fiscal insurance the company is subject to workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims 
the company is self insured for the cost of all workers compensation  vehicle and general liability claims up to the amount of stop loss insurance coverage purchased by the company from commercial insurance carriers 
the company maintains accruals for these self insurance costs  the amounts of which are determined using actuarial methods which evaluate open claims and take into consideration estimated ongoing loss development exposure 
many estimates and assumptions are involved in estimating future claims  and differences between future events and prior estimates and assumptions could affect future operating results and result in adjustments to these liabilities 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon management s expectation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the income tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized for which payment has been deferred  or expenses which already have been deducted in the company s tax return but which have not yet recognized as an expense in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets generally represent tax deductions or credits that will be reflected in future tax returns for which the company has already recorded a tax benefit in its consolidated financial statements 
the company establishes valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets as required under fas  accounting for income taxes 
at january   the company has recorded a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets of million  representing the total amount of such assets in excess of the company s deferred income tax liabilities 
the valuation allowance was recorded because management was unable to conclude  in light of the cumulative losses realized by the company that realization of the net deferred income tax asset was more likely than not 
the determination of income tax expense and the related balance sheet accounts  including valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events  including future operating results and the outcome of tax related contingencies 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated  the amount of income tax assets and liabilities  including valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  could be materially affected 
guarantee liabilities the company has guaranteed a portion of loan and lease obligations of certain franchisees in which the company owns an interest 
to the extent such guarantees relate to franchisees whose financial statements are consolidated with those of the company  the guaranteed indebtedness is included in the company s consolidated balance sheet and the guaranteed lease obligations are included in the disclosure of the company s lease obligations 
for guarantees related to franchisees accounted for using the equity method  the company assesses the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantees and records liabilities for the present value of any anticipated payments 
no liability for the guarantees related to equity method franchisees was recorded at the time they were issued because the company believed the value of the guarantees was immaterial  and there are no liabilities recorded for any such guarantee payments as of january  or january  assessing the probability of future guarantee payments involves estimates and assumptions regarding future events  including the future operating results of the franchisees 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated  the amounts estimated to be paid pursuant to such guarantees could change  and provisions to record such liabilities could be required 
investments in franchisees the company has investments in certain unconsolidated franchisees 
while the company believes that the recorded amounts of such investments are realizable  these franchisees typically are startup businesses 
table of contents without a history of successful operations  and the value of the company s investments in the franchisees cannot be verified by reference to quoted market prices 
the company s assessment of the realizability of these investments involves assumptions concerning future events  including the future operating results of the franchisees 
if future events are different from those assumed or anticipated by the company  the assessment of realizability of the recorded investments in these entities could change  and impairment provisions related to these investments could be required 
as of january   the company s investment in unconsolidated franchisees was approximately million
