item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction purpose of this presentation this presentation has been designed to provide a narrative explanation of the financial statements of community banks  inc community or the corporation 
the purpose of this presentation is to enhance the financial disclosures and to provide a framework for evaluating the extent to which historical performance can be relied upon to assess prospects for future performance 
presentation format throughout this presentation  net interest income and yields on earning assets have been presented on a fully tax equivalent basis 
balances represent average daily balances  earnings per share are diluted  and all dollar amounts are presented in thousands  unless otherwise indicated 
overview expansion if the central theme of community s performance were to be condensed into one word  that word would be expansion 
although expansion and growth have occurred on a variety of fronts  the most impressive expansion centered on the acquisition and merger of pennrock financial services corp 
pennrock  the former parent of blue ball national bank blue ball 
now operating as a division within the communitybanks franchise  blue ball has added assets totaling more than billion  including office locations  to community s current total of over billion in consolidated assets and office locations at the end of the year 
more importantly  blue ball and its enthusiastic and exceedingly talented team of employees helped to complete community s dramatic entree into the highly desirable berks  chester  and lancaster county regions of south central and southeastern pennsylvania 
community is now the eighth largest financial services holding company headquartered in pennsylvania  with a market capitalization well in excess of million at the end of merger description at the beginning of business on july   community completed its merger with pennrock  thus beginning an exciting chapter in the history of the growing community franchise 
pennrock s primary subsidiary  blue ball  was integrated as a division of communitybanks  which is the sole banking subsidiary of the financial services holding company known as community banks  inc under the terms of the merger announced on november   former shareholders of pennrock received more than  of common shares of community in exchange for all of their outstanding shares in pennrock 
this transaction was valued at an amount in excess of million at the time of the announcement 
as required under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the merger was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations purchase accounting 
consequently  blue ball results have been included in consolidated operating results of community for only the second half of the year 
the full year income statement offers a hybrid presentation of annual operating results consisting of pre merger community results for the first half of the year followed by post merger combined results in the second half 
unfortunately  comparisons of the hybrid operating performance to prior periods and are noticeably distorted  owing to the fact that presentations of pre results exclude blue ball activity 
throughout this presentation  certain pro forma financial information will be provided in order to make comparative results more meaningful to the reader 
such information will be clearly defined and labeled so as to provide presentations that  to the extent possible  are prepared on a consistent and comparable basis 
assets acquired de leverage strategy in the timeframe leading up to the merger  community conducted an extensive review and analysis of the balance sheet posture of both blue ball and pre merger community 
in connection with this review  management considered various alternative strategies designed to maximize the net interest margin and net interest income performance of the post merger  combined entity 
pursuant to the review  community executed a de leveraging strategy that focused on three primary objectives o reduce the combined company s exposure to high cost  long term wholesale funding 
o construct a post merger balance sheet posture that would reduce interest rate risk associated with certain short term wholesale funding sources 
o maximize combined investment portfolio performance in the post merger environment 
concurrent with the periods immediately before and after the merger  community executed its three pronged de leveraging strategy  which was timed to coincide with its acquisition of the net identifiable assets of blue ball 
the first stage commenced with the late second quarter prepayment of million of fhlb term advances  which resulted in a prepayment penalty of million 
these advances had a weighted average cost of  well in excess of the corporation s incremental wholesale borrowing rate 
additionally  such borrowings contained conversion features and terms not necessarily expected to be favorable to community in future periods 
the second and third phases involved the retirement of certain variable rate  short term wholesale funding of blue ball  accompanied by the disposition of the acquired investment portfolio 
these two phases were designed to reduce community s post merger exposure to potential future increases in the cost of short term funding sources and  to improve the overall yields on the post merger  combined investment portfolio 
as a result of the merger with blue ball  community acquired assets of billion 
pursuant to the guidance for applying the purchase method of accounting  these acquired assets and assumed liabilities were required to be restated at their fair market values at the date of the merger 
both the merger and de leverage strategies  like all balance sheet management efforts  occurred in a dynamic environment 
the synchronized execution of the merger consummation  the fair value restatement of acquired net assets  and the de leverage strategy  made it difficult to precisely isolate and quantify the impact of the individual components of those efforts on the post merger combination 
management believes  however  that the following summary portrays a reasonable depiction of the strategies that were executed concurrently with the merger of blue ball  and provides an appropriate benchmark from which to isolate the level of acquired growth attributable to the merger 
net assets acquired in merger purchase accounting adjustments de leverage strategy pro forma opening pennrock balances investment securities loans other assets total deposits short term borrowings long term debt other liabilities this summary will be helpful in understanding additional analyses that are provided later in this presentation 
these results help to draw a distinction between acquired growth from the merger versus growth attributable to organic sources 
organic growth has two elements growth from the underlying economic vitality of the geographic operating market and  growth achieved by capturing existing market share from competitors 
by isolating the acquired growth from the merger  trends regarding organic growth become more apparent and provide more meaningful comparisons to prior year reference points 
merger  conversion  and restructuring issues in addition to the aforementioned expenses associated with the prepayment of fhlb advances  community incurred certain other expenses associated with both the merger and with the adoption of a common operating platform for the newly combined company 
including the million fhlb prepayment expense  the aggregate expenses associated with the merger  the system conversion  and the balance sheet restructuring totaled million  and were reflected primarily in results for the second quarter of the merger of blue ball the target into community the acquirer had characteristics that were atypical of other bank related mergers that have occurred since the advent of mandatory purchase accounting 
blue ball  with over billion in assets  represented an immense increase of more than over pre combination assets of community 
in most transactions  it is common for the target to be substantially smaller than the acquirer 
accordingly  this merger transaction had specific terms and conditions that presented unique challenges 
in more conventional merger transactions  the employees of the target company who perform duplicative tasks are frequently identified for displacement  and are normally offered severance and or retention payments following consummation 
these payments are often a function of years of service  the need to ensure a smooth post merger transition  or other relevant factors 
under purchase accounting  payments to the target bank s employees are considered to be a component of the purchase price of the target and  by definition  do not affect near term operating results 
this same treatment is also afforded other incremental costs incurred by the target  including items such as contract cancellation fees or the cost of closing duplicative facilities in more conventional transactions  the workforce and facilities of the acquiring company are substantially unaffected by displacement issues because those employees and facilities are expected to remain in place following the merger 
the community pennrock transaction was distinctive in that both the acquirer and the target were affected by workforce displacement issues  duplicative contracts  and facility reconfiguration 
as required  the costs incurred for severance and retention for displaced employees of blue ball were added to the purchase price  a treatment consistent with most mergers 
unlike many mergers  however  community  the acquiring company  incurred certain incremental costs of the merger  including severance  retention and contract cancellation costs  which were required to be reported as an expense when incurred 
during the second and third quarters  community recorded expenses totaling million  which reduced operating results in those periods  as follows severance and retention payments to community employees being displaced in the merger   contract cancellations and closing of duplicate facilities   other   finally  community incurred incremental costs totaling  related to the implementation of its silverlake core processing platform in the second quarter of the implementation of this new core platform paved the way for a third quarter integration of the blue ball s pre existing silverlake platform  which had been installed a number of years earlier 
the fortuitous decision to migrate community s platform to silverlake  a decision reached well in advance of merger discussions with pennrock  was a primary factor in ensuring a smooth transition in the combination of the two banks 
aggregate merger  conversion and restructuring expenses totaled million million on an after tax basis and reduced net income  primarily in the second quarter  by of annual earnings per share 
as noted throughout this presentation  core and tangible income  both of which are defined as non gaap measurements  have excluded the impact of these items 
performance executive summary excluding the million of after tax merger  conversion and restructuring charges special charges  community recorded core net income of nearly million  an increase of million over the net income of million achieved in this was an increase of in year over year earnings 
even after reducing income for the aforementioned special charges  reported net income reached million and reflected a increase over core net income was comprised of million in the first half of the year and million in the second half 
as previously noted  blue ball operating activity was included only in the second half of the year and was the primary driver of the increase in net income between the first and second halves of on a per share basis  core net income reached compared to in actual reported earnings per share were and included of earnings dilution directly attributable to the merger  conversion and restructuring expenses 
improvement in the second half performance was partially constrained as community undertook deliberate strategies designed to achieve phased in savings and efficiencies by the beginning of the year was dominated by the preparations and efforts to absorb and integrate the operations of community and its new blue ball division 
the influence of internal  merger related distractions required deft management of core operating activities to minimize the merger s impact on existing customers 
at the same time  dynamic changes in economic conditions  including changes in the interest rate environment  presented additional challenges to preserving and improving the earnings stream 
while plans with respect to the blue ball merger were completed  contemporaneous plans were also put into place to create a leveragable infrastructure for future expansion 
the first component of those efforts was the replacement of the core processing system  which was completed in two phases to accommodate the blue ball integration 
capital levels and capital management plans related thereto  both of which are essential prerequisites for growth  are not expected to be a constraint on acquired or organic growth opportunities for the foreseeable future 
credit quality metrics continued to be sustained at historically low levels 
human capital  another essential precondition for growth  was bolstered by the staff additions and depth of experience provided by personnel from the blue ball franchise 
and finally  both blue ball and community continued to execute on their respective de novo expansion strategies 
all of these factors contributed to an elevated awareness of community as an acquirer of choice in both core and contiguous markets of the franchise 
furthermore  these efforts also served to demonstrate the franchise s ability to absorb and integrate merger partners in an effective and efficient manner 
gaap reporting issues there remains a profusion of issues affecting the presentation of financial information in financial statements 
in recent years  a strong emphasis has been placed on the adequacy  comparability  and transparency of financial information  particularly for publicly traded companies that are subjected to recurring financial reporting requirements 
the increased complexity associated with the measurement and presentation of financial information has been aggravated by the seemingly endless array of innovative and diverse financial transactions and structures 
this has led to a regulatory environment predisposed to mandating enhancements to summarize  simplify  and analyze the vital information contained in financial reports 
in the aftermath of the corporate scandals of recent years  congress and its designated oversight bodies have passed a wave of new legislation and regulations 
these new regulations  and the related disclosure requirements  have been designed to be responsive to the intense scrutiny being applied to financial presentations by investors  creditors  and other users 
this section of the presentation will summarize the salient generally accepted accounting principals gaap reporting issues associated with presentations of financial information for community banks  inc  including forward looking statements  critical accounting policies  and gaap versus non gaap presentations 
forward looking statements periodically  community has made  and will continue to make statements that may include forward looking information 
the corporation cautions that forward looking information disseminated through financial presentations should not be construed as guarantees of future performance 
furthermore  actual results may differ from expectations contained in such forward looking information as a result of factors that are not predictable 
financial performance can be affected by any number of factors that are not predictable or are out of management s direct control 
examples include the effect of prevailing economic conditions  unforeseen or dramatic changes in the general interest rate environment  actions or changes in policies of the federal reserve board and other government agencies  business risk associated with the management of the credit extension function and fiduciary activities 
each of these factors could affect estimates  assumptions  uncertainties and risk used to develop forward looking information  and could cause actual results to differ materially from management s expectations regarding future performance 
critical accounting policies the identification of those accounting policies which are deemed to be critical to the application of gaap on reported results of community banks  inc is an important facet of this presentation 
management has identified the applicable promulgations of gaap that have particular relevance in connection with reporting results for  as follows o allowance for loan losses adequacy of allowance o allowance for loan losses accounting for loans acquired in a transfer o purchase accounting for business combinations o other than temporary impairment of investment securities management believes that the application of its accounting policies and procedures for each of the above items should be considered to be a critical accounting policy to ensure the fair presentation of the corporation s financial statements 
adequacy of allowance the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  and the related provision for loan losses is one major area affected by critical accounting policies and procedures 
community applies a systemic methodology in order to estimate the allowance for loan losses 
this methodology incorporates management s judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio through a disciplined  regimented methodology that is consistently applied 
this process requires that a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio be performed on a quarterly basis 
this analysis includes a specific individual loan review for any and all loans that meet specific materiality criteria 
such loans are evaluated for impairment under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the portfolio is further stratified to analyze groups of homogenous loans with similar risk characteristics 
such loans are evaluated under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
management considers all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect loan collectibility  as well as particular risks indigenous to specific types of lending 
the process is further designed to consolidate the aggregate loss estimates and to ensure that the allowance for loan losses is recorded in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the final results are reviewed and approved by executive management 
results are regularly validated by a review of trends associated with loan volume  delinquencies  potential concentrations  or other factors that may influence the methodology used to estimate the allowance for loan losses 
accounting for loans acquired in a transfer the merger of pennrock on july  required the application of the specific provisions of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
this pronouncement addresses the accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from loans acquired in a transfer where differences are due  at least in part  to credit quality 
this sop prohibits carrying over valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in a purchase business combination and was effective for years beginning after december  community has given appropriate consideration to this guidance in establishing the accounting for the loans acquired as a result of the pennrock merger 
purchase accounting for business combinations in june of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards eliminated the pooling of interests method of accounting pooling in favor of purchase accounting 
further  these new standards were promulgated to ensure that post merger financial statements of combined entities are prepared in a manner that best represents the underlying economics of a business combination 
these standards necessitate the application of accounting policies and procedures that entail the use of assumptions  estimates  and judgments that are critical to the presentation of financial information  including the ongoing valuation of intangibles 
where necessary and appropriate  community has engaged independent outside consultants to provide objective and verifiable support for the use of certain estimates and assumptions in the application of those policies and procedures 
the ultimate responsibility for the application of these standards and the adequacy of disclosures related thereto rests with management 
while community has applied these new standards to other business combinations completed since  the magnitude of the pennrock merger on community s consolidated results suggests that the application of these standards is substantially more critical to the presentation of financial information 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities investment securities are written down to their net realizable value when there is impairment in value that is considered to be other than temporary 
the determination of whether or not an other than temporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment 
management reviews its investment securities portfolio regularly for possible impairment that is other than temporary by analyzing the facts and circumstances of each investment and the expectations for that investment s performance 
each of these critical accounting policies and procedures are highlighted later in this presentation and in the notes to the audited financial statements  as appropriate 
gaap versus non gaap like many financial institutions  community had accounted for virtually all of its business combinations using the pooling of interests method of accounting pooling prior to under pooling  historical pre merger financial information of the combined companies was restated as if the combination had occurred prior to the earliest period presented 
this approach was advantageous in that it allowed for year over year financial performance comparisons that were prepared on a consistent basis 
under purchase accounting  financial statements for any periods prior to the date of the merger are not restated  creating the potential for comparisons that  in some respects  are inherently inconsistent 
this contrast was especially apparent in presentations of community financial performance in  which included six months of blue ball activity  compared to and  which excluded all historical blue ball results 
like most other financial institutions that have made large acquisitions since the mandate of purchase accounting  community is now providing certain non gaap information to assist investors in their understanding of the effect of acquisition activity on reported results 
many of these disclosures have been designed to overcome comparability issues related to the influence of intangibles principally goodwill created in mergers 
the inherent shortcomings of purchase accounting  owing primarily to these comparability issues  has lead to an evolving practice of presenting non gaap financial information that utilizes terms such as tangible income  tangible assets  operating return on average tangible equity  and other relevant measures 
such information is not presented as a substitute for traditional gaap measurements  but is provided as a supplemental enhancement to improve comparability and investor understanding 
community has augmented its traditional gaap presentation by providing an extensive reconciliation of relevant gaap and non gaap measures to enhance its disclosures of comparative financial performance 
the reconciliation appears on page below is a summary of critical gaap measurements along with a brief description of the adjustments necessary to produce comparable non gaap measurements 
traditional gaap measures adjustments comparable non gaap measures balance sheet average assets excludes intangible assets from assets average tangible assets average equity excludes intangible assets from equity average tangible equity equity to assets excludes intangible assets from equity and assets tangible equity to assets book value per share excludes intangible assets from equity tangible book value per share performance net income eps excludes after tax effect of m a and other special charges core net income eps net income eps excludes after tax effect of cdi amortization  m a  and other special charges tangible or operating income eps return on average assets roa tangible net income divided by average tangible assets operating return on average tangible assets rota return on average equity roe tangible net income divided by average tangible equity operating return on average tangible equity rote quarterly presentation of gaap non gaap the timing of the merger of community and blue ball provided one additional frame of reference that was useful in understanding the hybrid financial performance in because the merger was consummated on july   operating results for the first and second quarters of the year consisted exclusively of pre merger community performance 
the second half included the combined performance of community and blue ball for the third and fourth quarters 
the existence of these discrete periods provided an opportunity to compare pre merger and post merger operating performance within concurrent with the announcement of the merger in late  community indicated that the two companies would be combined in a manner that would facilitate realization of expense savings that would be fully operational by the onset of in this presentation  community has provided certain comparative analyses designed to provide an indication of the relative effectiveness of those initiatives during the last half of analysis of these results will be critical to any evaluation of the extent to which past performance can be used to evaluate the prospects for future performance beyond performance analysis economic conditions during  the united states and its leaders continued to be preoccupied with issues concerning domestic terror  the situation in iraq  national and international natural disasters  and spiraling energy costs 
at the same time  the domestic landscape continued to reflect the benefits of an economic policy steadfastly focused on controlling inflation and mitigating the prospects for a recession 
this policy had been formulated in the wake of the year stock market bubble  the terrorist attacks of september   and the war in iraq 
for the last several years  the fiscal climate in the united states has been influenced by a monetary policy that was formulated to help sustain economic growth in the face of an abundance of adverse economic and political circumstances 
this policy accommodation had been crafted to ensure accessibility to credit  funding  and liquidity  including credit vehicles for commercial and consumer borrowers 
ultimately  this policy accommodation led to the lowest fed funds rate in years 
the fed funds rate  a key benchmark interest rate  reached its most recent trough of near the beginning of and was followed by steady increases for the remainder of that year 
by the end of  the benchmark target for fed funds had risen steadily to 
during  the federal reserve board the fed continued to reverse its previous policy accommodation through a more neutral interest rate policy that neither impeded nor over stimulated growth 
throughout  the fed continued to hike the funds target  which resulted in thirteen straight increases  before it reached on december of these increases reflected a policy change based on continued concerns about upside risks of inflationary pressures  the impact of the national budget deficit  and domestic industrial production that appeared to be growing closer to full capacity 
at the same time  mid and short term interest rates remained relatively constant and produced an increasingly flat yield curve 
this flattening sustained affordable credit terms for commercial and consumer borrowers throughout most of the year 
because of these favorable borrowing conditions  commercial and consumer loan demand remained robust throughout this period of low interest rates 
at the same time  credit quality steadily improved as underlying growth and consumer confidence supported economic vitality and stability for most of this convergence of circumstances produced a period of sustained credit expansion accompanied by unprecedented improvement in credit quality conditions throughout the year 
yield curve dynamics and banking the primary source of revenue for most financial institutions  particularly community banks  is derived from intermediation activities 
intermediation activities are defined as the net revenues generated from the process of gathering deposits  combined with the facilitation of credit extension to retail and commercial customers 
changing interest rates affect the pricing of amounts received on loans and investments as well as the amounts paid to acquire deposits and other funding sources 
banks must maintain a constant vigilance on monitoring and managing the effects of interest rate changes on this essential source of revenue production 
yield curve slope the yield curve for the various maturities of u 
s 
treasury securities provides a fundamental barometer that gauges the prevailing interest rate profile and  simultaneously  acts as a guidepost for current loan and deposit pricing constraints 
the yield curve also offers a reliable frame of reference from which to formulate cognitive assessments about future interest rate changes and their impact on intermediation based revenue production 
the slope of the yield curve is driven primarily by expectations for future interest rate increases and inflationary trends 
a normal yield curve has a slope that reflects lower costs for shorter term financial instruments  accompanied by symmetrical increases in costs for longer term instruments all along the maturity continuum 
short term interest rates are highly influenced by the monetary policy of the fed 
the federal open market committee  a committee of the fed  targets the fed funds rate  the overnight rate at which banks borrow or lend excess funds between financial institutions 
this rate serves as a benchmark for the overnight money costs  and correspondingly influences the pricing of a significant portion of a bank s deposit funding sources 
intermediate and longer term interest rates  unlike the fed funds rate  are more directly influenced by external market forces  including perceptions about future interest rates and inflation 
these trends  in turn  influence the pricing on mid and long term loan commitments as well as deposits and bank borrowings that have scheduled maturities 
generally speaking  a yield curve with a higher degree of slope provides more opportunity to increase the spread between earning asset yields and funding costs 
a steeper yield curve  when combined with growth in earning assets and deposits  can be expected to yield expanded revenue performance 
it should be emphasized that while the yield curve is a critical benchmark in setting prices for various monetary assets and liabilities in banks  its influence is not exerted in a vacuum 
credit risk  market risk  competitive issues  and other factors must all be considered  along with interest rate risk  in the pricing of financial instruments 
banking and the yield curve during  the overall level of interest rates was considered very low by historical standards 
during such a period  a steep or highly sloped yield curve may be a precursor of higher interest rates or elevated inflation in the future 
in that same low interest rate environment  a flat yield curve may be characteristic of a fed policy designed to calm an overheated economy by tightening credit availability via increases in short term rates 
if other rates along the maturity spectrum do not rise correspondingly  the yield curve can be expected to flatten 
this scenario may reflect an economic outlook that has little or no expectation of higher future interest rates or higher rates of inflation 
the slope of the yield curve  whether steep or flat  exists in a highly dynamic environment and does not precisely predict the extent  velocity or direction of future interest rate changes or inflationary trends 
the shape of the yield curve  however  remains a crucial barometer for financial institutions as they construct a strategic approach to pricing and revenue maximization in a variety of interest rate environments 
interest rate risk  or the potential impact that interest rate changes may have on intermediation based revenue production  is similar to other forms of risk in that it is inherently unpredictable 
and while the impact of rate changes on revenue performance can be estimated  managed  and moderated  it can never be fully hedged or ameliorated 
the ability to sustain or improve revenue streams from intermediation activities is vulnerable to unexpected or nontraditional shifts in interest rate dynamics 
these shifts sometimes manifest themselves in variations from the normal slope of the yield curve 
simulation to manage monetary assets and liabilities in a dynamic environment  banks utilize financial simulation models that are designed to quantify the effects of parallel shifts in the yield curve and measure their effect on the spread between earning asset yields and the cost of funding 
these models serve to quantify the amount of intermediation based revenue that is at risk if interest rates rise or fall 
a parallel shift occurs when all of the interest rates along the yield curve move in the same direction and by the same order of magnitude 
unfortunately  these models are less capable of predicting the effects of interest rate changes when interest rate dynamics venture outside customary parameters 
as an example  these models provide less predictable results in situations where benchmark rates change asymmetrically  or if changes occur at one end of the curve without directionally similar changes at the other 
furthermore  these models are also less proficient at forming assumptions about customer tendencies and product preferences during periods of dynamic interest rate change 
inverted yield curve late in  many economists began assessing the potential fallout from an inverted yield curve 
an inverted yield curve is the opposite of a normal yield curve and is characterized by short term rates that are higher than longer term rates 
the presence of an inverted yield curve is considered to be an anomaly that is almost counterintuitive to the core business of banking 
inverted yield curves do not typically exist for more than a short period of time 
in past economic cycles  the presence of an inverted yield curve has frequently foreshadowed a national recession 
however  while virtually all recessions have been presaged by an inverted yield curve  the presence of an inverted curve in previous cycles has not guaranteed the onset of a recession 
flat yield curve a flat yield curve  such as the one in place at the end of  has the potential to be sustained for a longer period of time 
in addition  the us economy has recently been confronted by the potential for a cooler post housing market and by higher energy and home heating prices 
to add further uncertainty  the economy is now confronted by a yield curve profile that has often been predictive of recessionary pressures 
this combination of circumstances could exacerbate the anxiety currently felt by commercial and retail customers about the prospects for economic difficulties  higher inflation  or a possible recession beyond for banks  the presence of a flat yield curve for a prolonged or sustained period could measurably lower expectations for expanding revenue from intermediation activities 
more importantly  the possibility of recession may suppress future asset growth trends and or increase the influence of other forms of risk  such as credit risk  which could hamper opportunities for revenue expansion and earnings growth in the near term 
performance summary and review against a backdrop of its landmark merger transaction and a multitude of other exogenous economic factors and trends  community reported its performance results for that performance reflected the combination of results for a pre merger community for the first half of  followed by a post merger community for the second half 
this hybrid performance  which provided tangible signs of potential performance enhancements beyond  was limited by the recognition of the special charges 
including these expenses  net income and earnings per share results for were million and  respectively 
this compared to net income of million and earnings per share of in important traditional measures of relative financial performance include return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe  which declined to and  respectively  for comparable measures in were and 
the decline in these measures was dramatically influenced by the impact of the merger  conversion  and restructuring expenses  and by the impact of the application of purchase accounting in the merger of pennrock 
as noted previously  comparable non gaap measures were cited as return on tangible assets rota and return on tangible equity rote  which actually increased to and  respectively  compared to and a year ago 
similar trends were noted with respect to earnings per share eps trends 
excluding the impact of the special charges in the second and third quarter  core eps reached and was nearly equal to the performance of 
while annual eps performance was flat  quarterly trends in the third and fourth quarters provided indications of the accretive benefits of the merger 
for example  while pre merger first quarter results were per share  the post merger fourth quarter results rose to a record per share as anticipated expense savings began to emerge from the combination of the two franchises 
the fourth quarter results were the highest quarterly net income and eps performance in the history of community 
growth in the various balance sheet categories was dramatically influenced by net assets added in the merger 
total loans grew from one year ago  while total assets and deposits grew and  respectively 
loans are now at billion at the end of  while deposits stand at almost billion 
the impressive growth rates achieved in included the acquired growth added through the blue ball merger 
in order to quantify the extent of organic growth  it was necessary to isolate this acquired growth from the period end balances at december  this analysis yielded pro forma balances that provided an indication of the extent of acquired growth achieved through expansion of market share or through the underlying vitality of community s marketplace 
the following table serves to illustrate the impact of both the various balance sheet strategies discussed earlier and the influence of organic growth on overall growth levels 
year end balances less pro forma opening pennrock balances equals pro forma year end balances year end balances change investment securities loans other assets total assets total deposits short term borrowings long term debt other liabilities total liabilities changes shown above serve to summarize the effect of the following balance sheet dynamics o reductions in investment balances were influenced by both the de leveraging strategy and the utilization of scheduled investment portfolio runoff to fund loan growth 
o organic loan growth reflected strong loan demand  which was affected by favorable pricing conditions throughout the year 
o growth in other assets was driven almost exclusively by the effect of intangibles added from the merger of blue ball 
o deposit growth  though steady  was not sufficient to fully fund loan demand 
interest rate conditions favored the utilization of scheduled investment runoff to fund excess loan demand 
o while short term borrowings increased  such borrowings were reduced from the combination of pre merger balances at community and blue ball 
o long term debt reductions were primarily effected by the prepayment of million of fhlb advances from pre merger community 
community s capital position was also affected by the merger 
by the end of  all post merger  combined capital ratios were sufficient to sustain the corporation s well capitalized designation and provided a strong base for future growth of the franchise 
the tangible equity to assets ratio  which provides a vital measure of capital adequacy in the post merger period  was at the end of the the four components of operating performance net interest income  the provision for credit losses  non interest income  and non interest expenses improved  primarily as a consequence of the additional six months of operating activity from blue ball 
excluding the impact of the special charges  each of the components reflected underlying metrics that underscore the efficacy of the post merger operations of the combined entities 
o net interest margin reached for  including margins of and in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
this was a marked improvement over the full year margin of 
despite the impact of an increasingly flat yield curve  net interest margin expanded in the post merger  second half of the year 
the de leveraging and balance sheet restructuring near the time of the merger helped to boost performance in the second half of o the provision for loan losses dropped from million in to million in the provision for exceeded net charge offs of  by nearly million  as asset quality improved despite higher overall loan balances 
o non interest income reflected the revenue stream added from the blue ball merger in the second half of o the efficiency ratio fell to  including in the fourth quarter  despite the fact that operating expenses included over million of increased intangible amortization in the second half of the year 
this represented a measurable improvement over the recorded for all of in addition  quarterly non interest expenses declined from million in the third quarter to million in the fourth quarter  as phased in efficiencies from the integration of blue ball were reflected in linked quarter expense reductions 
performance components the purpose of this section of the presentation is to provide a more in depth comparative analysis of the four major components of performance during net interest income community s major source of revenue continues to be derived from intermediation activities and is reported as net interest income 
net interest income is defined as the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest margin is a relative measure of a financial institution s ability to efficiently deliver net interest income from a given level of earning assets 
both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by the frequency  velocity  and extent of interest rate changes and by the composition and absolute volumes of earning assets and funding sources 
the following table compares net interest income and net interest margin components between and in thousands change amount yield rate amount yield rate amount yield rate interest income interest expense net interest income interest spread impact of non interest funds net interest margin influence of interest rate trends the yield curve  and the changes that have occurred over the last three years  have had a substantial influence on net interest margin and net interest income performance 
the following presentation of the yield curve  which depicts the rates in effect at the end of the last three years  provides some insight into the interest rate profile during those timeframes 
the presentation of the yield curve at the end of the past three years illustrates two primary issues that have affected interest rate trends since first  overall interest rates have increased  although such increases have been most significant at the short end of the curve  with little change in the longer maturities 
second  the yield curve at the end of had significantly less slope than the previous two year ends 
this phenomenon has resulted in an overall flattening of the yield curve 
the above presentation provides an array of interest rates in place at discrete points in time 
this comparison  while useful  serves to exaggerate actual rate trends as rates displayed at specific points in time are vulnerable to one day swings 
a more appropriate and inclusive comparison is provided by a presentation of an average yield curve for the last three years 
the pricing and yields of loans  investments  deposits  and borrowings can be more effectively correlated to changes in average rates over time 
the following is a presentation of the yield curve using average rates in place over the last three years 
while the yield curve presentation of average interest rates exhibited a more modest variation in rates than the presentation of year end rates  even the presentation of average rates portrayed an overall flattening of the yield curve 
ordinarily  these externally driven rate trends could be expected to narrow the net interest margin and compress net interest income 
these trends  and an evaluation of the combined interest rate risk profile of blue ball and community  prompted the formulation and execution of the three pronged de leverage strategy at mid year 
these strategic initiatives were major contributors to a renascent net interest margin in the second half of the year  despite the impediments presented by a flat yield curve environment 
interest income earning assets interest income reached nearly million  an increase of almost over the interest income of million reported for this increase was driven by the six months of blue ball assets added in the second half of the year and by the improved yield  which rose from in to for average earning assets grew from billion to almost billion over the two periods 
the growth in total earning assets  however  was relatively constrained as loan growth was partially funded by scheduled runoff in the investment portfolio 
while deposit growth was steady  it was inadequate to meet the funding requirements for loan growth 
investment portfolio balances as a percentage of total earning assets declined from in to in in addition to the use of scheduled investment runoff to fund loan growth  the relative size of the investment portfolio was also affected by the mid year de leveraging strategy 
both pre merger community and blue ball have historically focused their growth in the commercial and commercial real estate segments of their core markets 
this growth was also augmented by expansion of retail lending  including the home equity segment 
interest expense funding sources like interest income  interest expense was also influenced by changing interest rate dynamics and the growth attributable to the mid year acquisition of blue ball 
interest expense grew almost  from just over million in to nearly million in at the same time  the cost of aggregate funding rose from to 
while increases in funding costs were mitigated by the prepayment of fhlb advances and the overall de leveraging of rate sensitive funding sources  the rise in interest rates drove the basis point increase in the overall cost of funds 
fhlb advances  which comprise one of the more expensive sources of funding  now aggregate less than of funding sources compared to over in the reduced dependency on higher cost fhlb advances constrained the level of increase in the overall cost of funds 
the cost of deposit funding sources  however  increased as the pressure on short term interest rates required increases in rates offered on more rate sensitive deposit products 
interest spread net interest margin a financial institution s ability to effectively blend the impact of changing rates  shifting rate indices  customer preferences  and product development initiatives can be measured by the performance of interest spread  defined as the difference between earning asset yield and the cost of funding sources 
net interest margin combines the impact of interest spread with both investment of non interest bearing funding sources and management of non earning assets 
the corporation reported a notable improvement in net interest spread from in to in  and a similar increase in net interest margin  from to  over the same periods 
the increase in net interest margin was especially apparent after the mid year acquisition of blue ball as margin reached in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter  well above the and recorded in the first and second quarters  respectively 
the emergence of an improved margin was also linked to the impact of the growth in the contribution from non interest funding sources  which rose from to 
during periods of rising interest rates  the contribution from non interest funds to net interest margin is increased because funds can be invested at progressively higher rates 
during periods of declining rates  these funds can be expected to contribute to reductions in net interest margin 
quarterly performance a quarterly review of the components of net interest income provides a more significant analysis into the impact of the mid year merger of blue ball  the various de leveraging strategies and  their combined effect on net interest spread  net interest margin and net interest income 
the following table provides a comparison of earning asset yields  funding costs  and other information for each of the four quarters of and fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter asset yield funding cost interest spread net interest margin net interest income fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter asset yield funding cost interest spread net interest margin net interest income for most of  net interest spread and net interest margin operated within a relatively narrow band of performance 
the fed began to slowly reverse its accommodative monetary policy near the middle of  which resulted in increases in asset yields that were partially offset by similar increases in the cost of funds 
the gradual rise in rates began to provide modest expansion of spread and margin in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of during this time  increases in net interest income were largely driven by volume increases  primarily within the loan portfolio 
as community approached the merger consummation date  preparations were made to provide for the integration of the two companies  including plans to accommodate the balance sheet restructuring and de leverage strategies 
for most of the second quarter  community delayed reinvestment of scheduled maturity runoff from the investment portfolio and  instead  used this liquidity to facilitate the early payoff of the fhlb advances 
in the short term  this contributed to a slight compression of net interest margin in the second quarter of in the post merger timeframe  quarterly results exhibited the anticipated improvement in net interest spread and net interest margin 
in the third quarter  for example  net interest margin grew to  which was a basis point improvement from the pre merger second quarter 
by the end of the fourth quarter  the corporation was able to substantially complete the reinvestment of the proceeds from the liquidation of the blue ball investment portfolio  resulting in a further increase in margin to 
this expansion occurred despite the offsetting influence of the increasingly flat yield curve over the last half of provision for credit losses asset quality has been a mainstay of community s financial performance in recent years and proved to be no exception 
throughout the year  the corporation experienced improved credit quality metrics which were reflected in operating results 
the provision for loan losses declined from million in to million in  which corresponded to reductions in net charge offs 
net charge offs declined from million in to  in the ratio of net charge offs to average loans declined from in to for  the lowest level of charge offs in recent history 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to loans declined from at the end of to at the end of in connection with the merger of blue ball  community applied the provisions of sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
this pronouncement addressed the accounting for initial investments in loans acquired in a transfer in years after  including those acquired in a merger 
at the end of  the allowance for credit losses reached almost million and provided coverage of non accrual loans at that date 
non accrual loans  including those acquired in connection with the merger of blue ball totaled just million at the end of the provision and the allowance are recorded at levels which are responsive to both the ebb and flow of general credit quality patterns and  more specifically  to the risks inherent in both seasoned loans and in incremental additions to community s growing portfolio 
community undergoes a rigorous and consistently applied process on a quarterly basis in order to evaluate the allowance for loan losses and the determination of the quarterly provision for credit losses 
see the section of this discussion entitled allowance for loan losses and credit quality for additional information 
non interest income excluding investment related gains  community and blue ball each generated nearly of their total revenues from non interest income sources during pre merger in the two quarters immediately following the merger  the ratio for the combined company declined to just over 
the lower relative level of non interest income in the post merger period was partially related to the disposal of the operations of blue ball s actuarial  retirement and employee benefit consulting businesses at the time of the merger 
these businesses  which had generated nearly million in revenues in  had been operating on an unprofitable basis in recent months  with negligible prospects for a turnaround 
by excluding revenues from these businesses from pre merger information  pennrock s pro forma ratio of non interest revenue to total revenues would have been under 
the planned disposal of these businesses  which facilitated similar reductions in related expenses  contributed to the lower  ratio in the post combination  second half of the other major contributor to the lower ratio involved the impact of the cooler mortgage refinancing market and the related reduction in revenues from at both companies 
the following is a summary of the various categories of non interest income  which includes six months of blue ball activity in but excludes blue ball from all of change amount investment management and trust services service charges on deposit accounts other service charges  commissions and fees insurance premium income and commissions mortgage banking activities earnings on investment in life insurance other income investment security gains total non interest income community recorded modest investment related gains from security sales in compared to nearly million in excluding the impact of these gains  non interest income rose in despite the addition of blue ball activity for the last half of  growth in all non interest sources of revenue was constrained as compared to the rate of growth in net interest revenues from intermediation activities 
since combined results for and pre merger results in both excluded income from blue ball s actuarial  retirement and employee benefit consulting businesses  the disposal of that business had no impact on year over year growth rates 
in contrast  revenues from mortgage banking activities declined in real terms in and did serve to muffle merger related growth expectations 
revenues from mortgage banking declined from million in  to million in  in spite of the additional six months of blue ball activity in the last half of the year 
reduced activities in both refinance and purchased mortgages resulted in a reduction in revenues 
for different reasons  a reduction was also recorded in the other category  as results for had included a gain from the sale of community s credit card portfolio 
the remaining categories of non interest income reflected increases associated with the merger 
furthermore  many of these increases may foreshadow revenue enhancement opportunities as revenue producing activities become more coordinated in as an example  pre merger community had a modest trust department with just over million in managed assets 
at the end of  assets under management had grown to nearly million  primarily from assets added from blue ball s more robust trust operation 
retail investment sales  another component of this category  remained vigorous throughout the year and accounted for a substantial portion of the overall increase 
deposit service fees grew in line with expectations for the combined franchise 
during the last half of  community avoided initiating any wholesale changes in the fee structure in the blue ball division in order to forestall any potential for customer dissatisfaction in the post consummation period 
fee structures have been revisited in connection with planning but will continue to be considerate of customer retention issues 
other service charges included the impact of both atm surcharge fees and debit card income 
debit card income growth has been fueled by the continued use of this convenient electronic payment system 
during  community expanded customer awareness by initiating programs designed to encourage increased usage of this fee based payment medium 
fees from the separate  pre existing overdraft privilege programs in the predecessor banks will be more fully integrated during this program continued to meet customer needs with this widely accepted  consumer centric service 
growth in insurance commissions was subdued as insurance agency activities have not been fully extended throughout the blue ball market area 
the modest increase was also affected by a decline in title insurance commissions that was linked to the drop off in mortgage activity 
increases from bank owned life insurance income related primarily to the addition of pre existing programs that were in place at pennrock prior to the merger 
non interest expenses total non interest expenses reached million in  including over million of merger  conversion and restructuring expenses that were previously discussed 
excluding those special charges  non interest expenses reached million in compared to million in the previous year  an increase of nearly million or 
the mid year acquisition of blue ball was the predominant factor contributing to the higher expense level in in addition  the merger resulted in the recognition of an additional million in core deposit intangible amortization  all of which was recorded in the last half of the following is a summary of the various components of expenses for all of as compared to the previous year s results 
change amount salary and benefits occupancy expense marketing expense telecommunications expense amortization of intangibles other expenses subtotal merger  conversion and restructuring overview of merger impact operating expenses it is important to note that historical operating results included expenses only for pre merger community  there was no restatement of expenses to include blue ball 
the results  on the other hand  reflected a combination of pre merger community expenses for the first half of the year  along with merged results for community and blue ball for the second half 
as would be expected  results between the two years displayed distorted year over year comparisons owing to the six months of blue ball activity included in results 
despite the distortions attributable to anomalies associated with purchase accounting  certain expense trends provided meaningful revelations 
as discussed earlier  the efficiency ratio offers a sound basis to assess the effectiveness of operating expense controls relative to a given level of revenues 
the efficiency ratio is defined as expenses divided by operating revenues expressed on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
if expense levels were to rise at a faster pace than the rise in revenue growth  the efficiency ratio can be expected to increase 
for all of  the efficiency ratio was and was consistent with the ratio of in in  after excluding the special charges  the efficiency ratio for the full year actually declined to  reflecting the favorable impact of the mid year combination 
the ratio exhibited further improvement after excluding intangible amortization  a non operating expense  from the computation 
by excluding intangible amortization for  the efficiency ratio declined to a more impressive 
as further testimony to the expense savings achieved by the combination of the two franchises  efficiency ratios were computed for the discrete third and fourth quarter periods of post merger since integration efforts were phased in and were substantially complete by the end of the fourth quarter  the efficiency ratio for the three months ended december  provided a reasonable gauge to assess the impact of the merger on expense management 
the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter of declined to  the lowest quarterly ratio at community since the third quarter of the year was the last full year that community and blue ball and its parent company  pennrock operated as separate companies 
in that year  community reported nearly million in operating expenses shown above compared to almost million at blue ball not shown 
excluding any potential for expense savings  the addition of blue ball to community s results for a full year would have increased operating expenses by 
since the acquisition occurred at mid year  only one half of the increase  or  would have been expected in excluding the increases associated with the special charges and the amortization of intangibles  the increase in year over year expenses reached 
this admittedly simplistic analysis ignores a number of relevant factors  however  it does provide an intuitive  benchmark validation of the expected expense increases for the combined entity in more importantly  the change in the efficiency ratio  which is considerate of factors unrelated to the merger de novo branch expansion  inflationary increases  etc  served to demonstrate improved management of the combined operating expenses in the post merger timeframe 
salary and benefits the largest single component of non interest expenses is salary and benefits 
combined salary and benefit expenses comprised of operating expenses excluding both the special charges and intangible amortization in both and at the end of  the pro forma combined number of full time equivalent employees aggregated and was reduced to by the end of community was seeking workforce reductions of in connection with the consolidation of the operations and administration functions 
such reductions were largely achieved  but were offset by additional staffing for normal growth  including the employees added in the opening of five new office locations throughout the year 
throughout  community made plans to blend the various incentive  insurance and other employee benefit plans in order to provide consistent benefits across the newly combined organization 
while consolidation of these plans was largely accomplished by the end of the year  certain of the plans were continued during the transition period of june to december to accommodate plan administration and continuity of benefits for blue ball employees 
on january   one of the largest components of benefits  the group healthcare plan  was consolidated and represented the last major employee benefit plan to be integrated as a result of the merger 
community has historically followed the intrinsic value accounting method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  which was permitted under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

all options issued by community have been issued at fair value and  accordingly  no compensation expense has been recognized in the financial statements for stock options issued to employees  executive officers or directors through the end of as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  community has provided the required pro forma disclosures of the impact of stock compensation on net income and earnings per share by applying the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which amended sfas no 
and now requires financial statement recognition of compensation cost for stock options and other stock based awards for fiscal periods beginning after community evaluated the various provisions of sfas no 
r and the optional transition methods and decided to adopt the modified prospective method 
this method requires recognition of compensation expense for the unvested portion of existing awards and new grants  but does not require a restatement of prior periods 
stock compensation expense of approximately  will be recorded between the first quarter of and the last quarter of for the unvested portion of existing awards at december  in addition  in january  community granted  options that will vest over years 
the options have an estimated fair value of million  of which approximately  will be recorded as compensation expense in the company and its board of directors  through its compensation committee  will continue to review and evaluate the ongoing role of stock based compensation in its overall compensation structure 
occupancy occupancy expenses and increases therein are normally tied to the pace of office expansion efforts 
in  community and blue ball opened a total of new offices  which represented a increase in the number of office locations 
during  occupancy expenses grew to million  an increase of over the amounts recorded during for the pre merger community 
this rate of increase was evaluated in light of the expected  intuitive increase of implied by the addition of blue ball facilities costs for the last six months of incremental increases above were attributed  in part  to the aforementioned office expansion 
during  and in connection with the merger of blue ball  community implemented a reconfiguration of its back office operations that was designed to accommodate merger related expense savings and improve operating processes 
this reconfiguration was an integral component of the blue ball integration plan and  at the same time  provided a structural platform for future expansion 
during  community bifurcated its processing operations into two primary locations and now enjoys the depth of management and strategic duplication of facilities that will accommodate both franchise growth as well as certain of its disaster recovery needs 
marketing expenses during the two years preceding  community timed the expansion of its marketing efforts to coincide with the market disruption that had accompanied two high profile mergers of larger  formerly locally managed financial institutions 
these expenses  in large measure  were incurred to improve the profile of community in markets where competitors were deemed particularly vulnerable 
during both and  marketing expenses grew at rates well in excess of the overall growth in non interest expenses  reaching growth of and  respectively  in those years 
during  the corporation made a conscious decision to moderate increases in marketing efforts as the organization became  to some extent  inwardly focused on merger integration and customer retention issues 
at the same time  the amalgamation of marketing initiatives between the newly combined banks also helped pave the way for the aggregate reduction of in marketing expenses from telecom expenses the growth of community s franchise and the need for improved communications has elevated the importance of efficient and effective management of telecom expenses 
for the last three years  the corporation has incurred substantial expenses related to the costs of upgrades for communications and data connectivity improvements for community s growing office network 
during  the corporation underwent an intensive study with an outside vendor specializing in the review and analysis of its telecommunications strategy 
these efforts  which included renegotiation of telecom rates  identified cost savings that moderated telecom expense growth in and continued to reap benefits in such initiatives were instrumental in offsetting the incremental expense increases that would have been expected with the addition of the blue ball network 
instead  telecom expenses grew modestly from to  reflecting an increase of just under 
amortization of intangibles in connection with the merger of blue ball  community recorded intangible assets of million  including a core deposit intangible of million 
under the provisions of fasb statement no 
 acquirers are no longer required to amortize the intangible asset associated with goodwill  which was the most significant portion of the intangibles recorded as a result of the blue ball merger 
instead  such amounts must be periodically tested for impairment 
in contrast  certain other intangible assets are deemed to have finite lives and are required to be amortized over their assumed lives 
the increase in intangible amortization reflects the impact of the blue ball related core deposit intangible amortization recorded in the last half of results in included amortization of intangible assets from previous acquisitions of smaller  integrated financial service companies 
other expenses significant categories of expenses contained in this grouping include pennsylvania bank shares tax  insurance  contributions  stationery  printing  postage and various other expenses 
virtually all of the increases were influenced by the incremental expenses arising from the merger of blue ball or by expenses associated with business volume increases 
income taxes income taxes grew from million in to million in  an increase of 
the increase was commensurate with the increase in pretax income  resulting in a nominal tax rate of in versus in the relative rate of tax exempt income influences the reported income tax rates and remains the primary reason for the difference between the nominal tax rate and the statutory federal tax rate for corporations 
statement of condition overview at december   the corporation s total assets reached billion  reflecting a change of from the billion of assets recorded at the end of average assets reached billion for compared to billion for  an increase that was substantially driven by the mid year merger of blue ball 
average loans reached billion  increasing from  while average investments actually declined  to million 
growth in the investment portfolio was curtailed by two factors the restructuring and de leveraging strategies that were coordinated with the timing of the merger  and  the use of scheduled investment runoff to fund loan growth 
the decision to use scheduled investment runoff to fund loans was influenced by a lower deposit growth rate and by the opportunity to extract higher asset yields from loan demand 
deposits grew to billion  but the increase of was not sufficient to keep pace with the growth in loans 
loan growth benefited from increased demand for credit in both the consumer and commercial sectors 
consumer demand for credit was influenced by both low rates and sustained consumer confidence 
growth in the commercial sector was related to community s ability to garner market share from larger  less nimble financial institutions 
aside from the impact of the merger  the growth trends experienced in the last several years provided a validation of community s commitment to staying close to its core markets and to using local presence and responsiveness as a competitive advantage 
investments community has established corporate investment policies that address various aspects of portfolio management  including quality standards  liquidity and maturity limits  investment concentrations and regulatory guidelines 
the corporation s objective with respect to investment management includes maintenance of appropriate asset liquidity  facilitation of asset liability strategy and maximization of return 
compliance with investment policy is regularly reported to the board of directors 
investment classification securities to be held for indefinite periods of time are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
community actively manages its investment portfolio and  accordingly  has classified a substantial portion of its portfolio as available for sale 
such securities are intended to be used as part of community s asset liability management strategy  and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  prepayment risk and other factors affecting overall investment strategy 
under current policy  if management has the intent and the corporation has the ability to hold securities until maturity  securities are classified as held to maturity investments at the time of purchase and carried at adjusted historical cost 
during  community purchased million of investments that were classified as held to maturity  which represented only of the aggregate portfolio at the end of the year 
activity investment activity during was affected by a multiplicity of factors  the combination of which resulted in an decline in average investments 
this decline occurred despite the acquisition of the pre merger investment portfolio of blue ball 
some of the more significant dynamics included the following o the entire portfolio of investments acquired from the merger of blue ball was liquidated immediately after the merger 
o proceeds received from the liquidation of blue ball s portfolio were coordinated with the de leveraging strategy  described earlier 
o certain of the liquidation proceeds were reinvested at higher yields in the post merger period 
o scheduled runoff from the investment portfolio was utilized to accommodate the de leverage strategy and to facilitate the demand for credit funding  which outpaced the growth from deposit funding sources 
at the end of  the investment portfolio comprised of earning assets  compared to at december  the decline in the relative level of investments was directly influenced by the above factors 
the pretax unrealized net loss within the investment portfolio at december  was million 
as required to the extent it pertained to available for sale securities  this fair value adjustment was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss adjusted for income taxes in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
for those securities classified as available for sale  million have a fair market value that exceeded the adjusted historical cost  with unrealized pretax gains totaling million 
alternatively  available for sale securities totaling million have a fair market value less than the adjusted historical cost  including unrealized losses of million 
securities classified as held to maturity had fair market values  less than carrying values 
special consideration was given to those securities which were affected by unrealized losses 
other than temporary impairment for several years  regulators have been addressing the issue of accounting for impairments of certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb issued authoritative guidance in its project known as eitf unfortunately  portions of the requirements of eitf were not well received and resulted in a number of additional clarifications to the treatment for securities that meet the definition of other than temporary impairment otti 
in november of  the fasb issued a final fasb staff position  which nullified and clarified certain provisions of existing accounting literature 
community has established a process to apply the accounting requirements for those securities which are deemed to have the potential to be considered for otti 
this process requires that all securities which have a decline in fair market value below the carrying value be reviewed on a quarterly basis 
the review of those securities requires an analysis of the following o the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  o the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and o the intent and ability of the corporation to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
at the end of  community reviewed million of securities which had a fair market value which was less than amortized cost 
based upon its evaluation  which was considerate of the factors above  and the corporation s ability and intent to hold those investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value  community does not consider those investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  investment summary the following tables summarize amortized cost and estimated fair values at december    and and maturity distribution of securities at december  amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value us government and federal agency mortgage backed  primarily federal agency state and municipal corporate equity total maturity distribution of securities within one year one through five years five through ten years after ten years total average maturity weighted average yield a us government and federal agencies yr

loans as has been the pattern for the last several years  overall earning asset growth has been concentrated in the expansion of commercial and commercial real estate lending 
while loan balances acquired via the merger of blue ball would be expected to deliver a minimum average growth rate near the benchmark  actual growth from to was  summarized as follows change amount commercial commercial real estate residential real estate consumer total the pre merger loan portfolios at community and blue ball were similar in composition  with comparable credit quality attributes 
as a consequence  the post merger  combined loan profile was not substantially different than the historical loan profile of pre merger community at the end of the differences that did exist  such as blue ball s lower concentration of consumer loans  were comparatively modest 
the following table summarizes the relative mix of the loan portfolio between pre merger and post merger commercial commercial real estate residential real estate consumer total by excluding the loans added on the date of the merger  it was estimated that average loan balances would have grown by at least from organic sources 
growth was also aided by loans added at blue ball during the first six months of for the last several years  the separate  pre merger banks focused on leveraging their respective positions as two of the larger financial institutions that remained headquartered in the dynamic central pennsylvania markets 
both companies had improved their visibility within core markets  particularly in the commercial and commercial real estate sectors 
the addition of experienced lenders with long term ties to the business communities in those markets enhanced the combined profile and increased access to additional commercial lending opportunities 
brisk activity in both construction and land development lending and in traditional commercial real estate financing contributed to substantial increases in these categories 
commercial lending activity continues to be driven almost exclusively by in market transactions 
residential real estate lending  which is composed primarily of loans to single family creditors  has experienced a steady decline as a result of the increasing accessibility of secondary market liquidity through mortgage banking activities 
community based banks continued to provide a convenient portal for consumers to access funding for residential lending  but most fixed rate  conforming mortgages were sold into the secondary market 
this strategy has reduced the interest rate risk associated with consumer preferences for long term  fixed rate lending  and provided valuable liquidity for other forms of relationship lending 
the influence of a cooling housing market in could limit  to some extent  the pace of mortgage lending activity in the near term 
community has undertaken substantial efforts  particularly in recent years  to become a more competitive consumer lender within its historical footprint 
prior to the merger  blue ball had followed a more decentralized approach than community in its efforts to escalate consumer lending volumes 
in the post merger environment  community s more centralized approach to consumer lending initiatives will be more fully integrated within the blue ball division 
these efforts have been designed to identify consumer lending opportunities more proactively and to penetrate customer relationships more fully 
the centralization of administration and oversight of consumer lending activities  inclusive of the blue ball division  is expected to result in a more strategic approach to expanded activity in the consumer lending sector 
allowance for loan losses and credit quality the following sets forth activity within the allowance for credit losses for the last three years 
balance at january  loans charged off recoveries provision charged to operations allowance established for acquired credit risk balance at december  allowance for credit losses to loans loan quality metrics for the last several years  the credit quality profile of communitybanks has exhibited steady improvement  and the results for represented a continuation of these favorable trends 
despite the increase in credit risk that normally accompanies a rapidly growing loan portfolio  most loan quality metrics continued to reflect meaningful improvement from historical trends 
the ratio of net charge offs to loans for and was and  respectively 
this performance was particularly notable as aggregate loan balances grew in and in as indicated earlier  the composition of the loans added as a result of the merger of blue ball had little impact on the overall credit risk profile  owing primarily to the similarity in the composition of loans at the two banks 
more importantly  both the community and blue ball franchises shared a common credit quality culture  evidenced by the favorable trends and metrics of the predecessor banks prior to the merger 
while the level of net charge offs provides an important historical perspective  future prospects for sustaining asset quality can be better assessed by scrutinizing the level of problem credits and the relative coverage provided by the allowance for credit losses 
at december   the allowance provided times coverage of those loans included as non accrual loans 
at the end of  this same ratio was times 
these measures  as well as a number of other key measures  serve to illustrate the prospects for sustaining the favorable credit quality profile of the post combination loan portfolio 
the following sets forth loan loss experience for the last five years in thousands loans at year end average loans balance balance  allowance for loan losses  january loans charged off commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial mortgage real estate retail mortgage consumer and other total loans recovered commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial mortgage real estate retail mortgage consumer and other total net charge offs provision for loan losses allowance established for acquired credit risk balance  allowance for loan losses  december net charge offs to loans at year end net charge offs to average loans balance of allowance for loan losses to loans at year end prior breakouts of historical information could not be readily reconstructed from predecessor banks records 
breakouts from are assumed to approximate current mix trends 
sop the ratio of the allowance to loans declined significantly from at the end of to at the end of as previously noted  community applied the provisions of sop  which governs the accounting treatment for expected differences between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows from loans acquired in a transfer if differences are due  at least in part  to credit quality 
this sop prohibits carrying over valuation allowances in the initial accounting of all loans acquired in a purchase business combination and was effective for years beginning after december the application of this new guidance to those loans acquired from blue ball was the primary impetus for the reduction in the ratio of the allowance to loans from to 
the review of acquired loans with credit quality issues produced a difference of million between contractual cash flows and the estimate of expected cash flows 
this difference was recorded as an adjustment of the carrying value of those loans and was excluded from the allowance 
while the allowance to loans ratio of is the accepted gaap measure  inclusion of the adjustment associated with sop in the allowance would have resulted in a comparable non gaap ratio of 
management process the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio 
each quarter  a review is performed to address loan quality  current macro economic conditions and delinquency status 
the provision for loan losses is adjusted quarterly based upon that review 
the following table presents an allocation by loan categories of the allowance for loan losses at december for the last five years 
loans commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage installment unallocated balance the corporation s allowance for loan losses is based upon management s quarterly review of loans utilizing a consistent valuation methodology 
the purpose of the review is to assess loan quality  identify impaired loans  analyze delinquencies  ascertain loan growth  evaluate potential charge offs and recoveries  and assess general economic conditions in the markets served 
commercial and commercial real estate loans are individually risk rated by the corporation s loan officers and periodically reviewed by independent loan review personnel 
consumer and residential real estate loans are generally analyzed in homogeneous pools utilizing historical loan charge off information 
to determine the allowance and corresponding loan loss provision  an amount is allocated to specific loans 
for certain commercial and construction loans  this amount is based upon specific borrower data and supporting collateral determined by reviewing individual non performing  delinquent  or potentially troubled credits 
for the majority of the loans that are individually reviewed for impairment  this analysis is based on a comparison of the loan s carrying amount to the net realizable value of the collateral 
the portion of the allowance attributable to specific impaired loans was million at december  the remaining commercial  consumer  and residential real estate loans are evaluated as part of various pools 
these pool reserves are based upon historical charge offs and delinquency history  other known trends and expected losses over the remaining lives of these loans  as well as the condition of local  regional and national economies and other qualitative factors 
to ensure a higher degree of confidence in the adequacy of the allowance  a portion is considered unallocated 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is intended to provide for probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable  possible imprecise estimates in assessing potential losses on commercial loans or in the calculation of pool reserves  and the extenuating influence of extraneous factors  such as economic uncertainties 
this unallocated portion is available to absorb losses sustained anywhere within the loan portfolio 
the combined allocated and unallocated portions bring the total allowance to an amount deemed prudent and reasonable by management at that time 
the allowance of million at december   increased million from december   due principally to establishing pool reserves of million for loans acquired in the blue ball merger 
the remaining increase resulted from quarterly adjustments under the processes described above 
the unallocated portion of the allowance increased to million at december   from million at december   reflecting management s consideration of the factors necessary to maintain a prudent and reasonable total allowance  particularly with the addition of approximately million of loans in the blue ball merger 
risk elements the following sets forth information regarding various segments of the loan portfolio  collectively referred to as risk elements 
these segments include both nonperforming assets and those loans past due for days or more 
non performing assets include non accrual loans  restructurings  and other real estate 
non accrual loans are loans for which interest income is not accrued due to concerns about the collection of interest and or principal 
restructured loans may involve renegotiated interest rates  repayment terms  or both  because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower 
substantially all of the credits that would have qualified as restructured loans at the end of both years were already classified in the more severe non accrual category 
the following table provides a comparative summary of nonperforming assets and total risk elements at the end of each of the last five years 
loans on which accrual of interest has been discontinued commercial  financial and agricultural mortgages other total non accrual loans foreclosed real estate total non performing assets loans past due days or more commercial  financial and agricultural mortgages consumer and other total risk elements ending allowance for loan losses ending allowance to non accrual loans the increase in non performing assets was almost entirely due to non accrual loans added in connection with the merger 
from an historical perspective  both community and blue ball experienced modest levels of non performing assets in recent years 
consequently  the combination of the two banks yielded a combined improvement in the relative level of non performing assets 
with the addition of blue ball  the year end ratio of non performing assets to period end loans actually declined from at the end of to at the end of of a total of million in nonperforming assets  nearly million were classified as non accrual loans 
the determination to discontinue the accrual of interest on non performing loans is made on a case by case basis 
factors such as the character and size of the loan  quality of the collateral and the historical creditworthiness of the borrower and or guarantors are considered by management in assessing the collectibility of such amounts 
the approximate amount that would have been accrued on those loans for which interest was discontinued in was  overall assessment community has considered all of the above factors in the establishment of the allowance for loan losses 
the determination as to the adequacy of the allowance reflects management s judgment  and was based upon collateral  local market conditions  various estimates  and other information that requires subjective analysis 
these factors  which are prone to change  are monitored by management to evaluate their potential impact on management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance 
based on its evaluation of loan quality  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  was adequate to absorb probable losses within the loan portfolio 
intangible assets community recorded million of intangible assets in connection with the merger of blue ball  including million in core deposit intangibles 
the corporation had recorded intangibles of million from previous mergers  primarily from acquisitions of various integrated financial services companies 
the acquisitions of these companies expanded community s ability to meet specialized customer needs in the areas of title insurance  mortgage brokerage services  property and casualty insurance  and other important financial services 
under current gaap  goodwill is no longer amortized as a charge to earnings 
instead  such amounts are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
other intangible assets  such as core deposit intangibles and acquired customer lists  must be recognized as an asset separate and distinct from goodwill and must be amortized over their expected useful lives 
during  community recorded million of intangible amortization  the majority of which related to amortization of the core deposit intangible arising from the acquisition of blue ball 
intangible assets are generally excluded from the computation of the various regulatory capital ratios 
at the end of  community reported capital ratios well within the guidelines that have been established to qualify as a well capitalized financial institution 
intangible levels  therefore  are deemed to be well within acceptable guidelines 
see the section entitled capital adequacy for further discussion 
other assets the july merger with pennrock and expansion of ongoing business activity resulted in increases in other asset categories from december  to december  cash and due from banks increased million from million to million  premises and equipment increased million from million to million  and accrued interest receivable and other assets increased million from million to million 
deposits deposit balances remain the primary source of funding for financial institutions 
total funding sources included both deposits and various forms of short term and long term wholesale borrowings 
at the end of  deposits represented of total funding sources 
this was an increase from the end of  when deposits were of total funding sources 
the heavier weighting of deposit funding resulted from the impact of the blue ball acquisition and from the de leveraging strategy  both of which contributed to reductions in community s dependence on wholesale funding 
the following table presents the growth in average deposit balances as amounts include deposits added from blue ball for the last half of the year 
change amount demand savings now accounts time time  or more as with loan balances  growth in deposit funding consisted of both acquired growth and organic growth 
it was estimated that organic growth in deposits was between and during as previously discussed  organic loan growth was near and exceeded organic deposit growth  creating a funding shortfall 
for much of the year  community utilized scheduled runoff in the investment portfolio to fund loan growth  obviating the need to aggressively pursue deposit growth as interest rates rose 
as with loans  the composition of deposits was substantially the same in pre merger as it was in post merger the following table presents the average mix of deposits for the last two years demand savings now accounts time time  or more consumer preferences continued to be weighted in favor of maintaining adequate liquidity in anticipation of further interest rates increases 
during much of  consumers were largely unresponsive to incremental rate premiums on deposit categories with longer maturities 
expectations of further increases in the general level of interest rates continue to drive a preference for liquidity and an aversion to locking up funds in longer term maturity categories 
consumers seem to believe that conditions such as the national budget deficit  higher oil prices  and other inflationary pressures are likely to result in more favorable pricing on deposits in the future 
furthermore  the relatively flat yield curve provided little incentive to extend maturities as rate premiums on longer maturities offered only a modest yield enhancement over short term rates 
the following table summarizes the maturity distribution of time deposits of  or more as of december  in thousands 
remaining time to maturity less than three months three months to six months six months to twelve months more than twelve months borrowed funds community makes tactical use of federal home loan bank fhlb advances and other borrowed funds to augment its funding needs 
the largest component of borrowed funds comes from fhlb advances 
fhlb borrowings  which are collateralized by residential mortgages or other qualified securities  include a variety of credit products available to community through its membership in the federal home loan bank 
the use of advances and borrowed funds is a by product of community s overall asset liability management strategy and is influenced by a number of factors  which are discussed more fully in the section titled asset liability management and liquidity 
at the end of  the corporation had the capacity to borrow an additional million from the fhlb 
capital adequacy capital strength is an important gauge to assess the overall stability of a financial institution 
a strong capital base is a prerequisite for sustaining franchise growth through both internal expansion and strategic acquisition opportunities 
regulatory authorities impose constraints and restrictions on bank capital levels that are designed to help ensure the vitality of the nation s banking system 
capital management policy community believes that capital is a valuable  albeit limited resource whose availability moderates with changes in the business cycle 
the corporation has developed an extensive capital management policy designed to consider all aspects of capital management 
this policy is mindful of the responsibilities to community s shareholders  employees  regulators  and other constituencies to ensure that capital is well managed 
the policy considers the impact of numerous capital management issues  including the maintenance of key financial ratios  the need for an adequate return to shareholders in terms of both dividend payout and capital appreciation  the flexibility to apply techniques that will accommodate either equity expansion or contraction  and the restraint required to avoid accumulation of unsustainable levels of intangible assets 
community also continuously examines its options with regard to capital management in the context of intrinsic factors  including its prospects for growth  the potential for earnings disruption  and others 
maintenance of appropriate capital levels may require the application of techniques designed to help community meet or exceed regulatory guidelines and to correlate capital levels with a given asset growth rate 
the corporation s capital management and planning process is reviewed and approved by its board of directors 
regulatory guidelines in addition to internal guidelines  regulators have established standards for the monitoring and maintenance of appropriate levels of capital for financial institutions 
all regulatory capital guidelines are based upon a risk based supervisory approach that has been designed to ensure effective management of capital levels and associated business risk 
regulatory capital guidelines continue to evolve and financial institutions are anticipating the implementation of new standards from the basel ii accords in the not too distant future 
the following table provides the current risk based capital positions of community and its principal banking subsidiary at the end of  along with an indication of the current regulatory capital requirements 
december  well capitalized regulatory minimums leverage ratio community banks  inc bank only tier capital ratio community banks  inc bank only total risk based capital ratio community banks  inc bank only the merger of blue ball presented special capital management challenges related to intangibles and their influence on capital levels 
despite the addition of million of intangible assets  tangible capital levels following the merger of blue ball remained sufficient to ensure community s classification as a well capitalized institution 
capital management the primary source of capital is earnings and  more specifically  earnings retention 
earnings retention is composed of quarterly earnings minus regular cash dividends to shareholders 
throughout  the corporation s earnings trends supported a return of capital to existing shareholders in the form of a quarterly cash dividend 
capital management is influenced primarily by earnings retention  but can be augmented by a number of other strategies designed to ensure that capital levels are maintained at optimum levels 
in addition to cash dividends  another efficient means of returning capital to shareholders involves share repurchase  which reduces the level of capital by purchasing common shares in the open market 
following the merger  the corporation announced two separate share repurchase plans in the third and fourth quarters 
the third quarter plan called for the repurchase of  shares and was completed by october of the fourth quarter plan called for an additional  shares and resulted in the purchase of just over  shares before the end of capital management is also considerate of techniques that can be used to increase capital levels 
at the end of both and  community executed separate issuances of million of trust preferred stock 
total trust preferred balances remained at million as of the end of these issuances of trust preferred stock qualified as tier capital while meeting certain regulatory limitations and are classified as long term debt for financial statement purposes 
in january of  the corporation issued approximately million of additional trust preferred stock at favorable terms 
community will continue to make use of this and various other strategies and techniques to ensure an efficient use of this valuable resource and to maintain capital at levels that are considerate of its operating risk profile 
asset liability management and liquidity the process by which financial institutions manage earning assets and funding sources under different interest rate environments is called asset liability management 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to increase net interest income through the prudent control of market risk  liquidity  interest rate risk and capital 
two important barometers of performance are net interest margin and liquidity 
net interest margin is increased by widening interest spread while controlling interest rate sensitivity 
the adequacy of liquidity is determined by the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of both depositors and customers requesting credit 
the board of directors and the audit committee of the board govern and monitor asset liability management processes and liquidity as part of the overall risk management process 
the responsibility for management of these processes is delegated to the corporate asset liability management committee alco  which must adhere to parameters established in the board approved asset liability management policy 
liquidity liquidity is defined as the ability to meet maturing obligations and customers demand for funds on a continuous basis 
appropriate liquidity exists when an entity can meet its potential cash obligations without liquidating its franchise assets 
poor liquidity exists when a company lacks the liquid assets to cover short term liabilities 
liquidity is sustained by stable core deposits  a diversified mix of liabilities  strong credit perception and the presence of sufficient assets convertible to cash without material loss or disruption of normal operations 
adequate liquidity could contract if there were reversals in the historical trends that have contributed to the stability and growth of community s deposit base 
the corporation actively manages liquidity within a defined range and has developed reasonable liquidity contingency plans  ensuring the availability of alternate funding sources that are sufficient to maintain adequate liquidity under a variety of business conditions 
the corporation s investing and financing activities are conducted within the overall constraints of its liquidity management policy and practices 
rate shock simulation community utilizes a variety of techniques to assist management and the board of directors in the management and monitoring of interest rate risk 
in order to quantify the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income  the corporation conducts quarterly interest rate shock simulations that project the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income over the next year 
these simulations are utilized to assess whether management should consider corrective actions in order to minimize community s exposure or vulnerability to a particular trend in interest rates 
management has established acceptable tolerance limits for the impact of changes in interest rates on the volatility of net interest income  and is authorized to pursue mitigating strategies in order to minimize unfavorable impact under a variety of scenarios 
such simulations are conducted under a variety of assumptions that require estimates of the velocity and extent of interest rate changes  including an assessment of the impact of such changes on those assets and liabilities that have indeterminate maturity or repricing characteristics 
the impact of rate changes on revenue performance can be estimated  but such estimates remain vulnerable to unexpected or nontraditional shifts in interest rate dynamics 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure community s earning exposure for the ensuing year 
this exposure is estimated under assumptions which assume a parallel shift in the yield curve 
the asset liability management policy limits unfavorable exposure of simulated net interest income to of the base case net interest income in either a rising or falling rate shock scenario immediate repricing of basis points 
the following is a summary of the rate shock results conducted under these various assumptions as december  simultaneous rate shock annual change in net interest income change bp million bp million bp million bp million gap and eve management augments its simulation process with two other techniques  gap analysis and economic value of equity eve computations 
the most practical tool for day to day management of interest rate risk is gap analysis  which provides an array of timeframes during which earning assets and funding sources can be expected to mature or reprice 
this information is ordinarily examined in the context of the results derived from the quarterly rate shock simulations 
management uses such information to identify specific cause and effect relationships that can be reviewed  analyzed  managed  or changed to ensure maximization of net revenue from intermediation activities 
the combination of gap analysis and rate shock simulations provides the most practical measurement tools for monitoring and managing of the largest source of revenue for community banks 
as with the simulation or shock analysis  community has established a policy limit for the cumulative twelve month gap of plus or minus of total assets 
at december   the twelve month gap fell well within this policy limit for each of the time intervals less than one year  as shown in the following summary interval cumulative gap expressed as of assets days days days eve computations provide a longer term assessment of interest rate risk  but are more practical for evaluating long term  strategic decision making 
eve has several limitations  including the intrinsic value of assets and liabilities does not necessarily represent the fair value of financial instruments since it does not include credit risk and liquidity  estimated cash flows are required for non maturity financial instruments and are  by their nature  inexact  and the future structure of community s balance sheet does not consider increased loan and deposit activities from core business within its present value assessment 
the results derived from eve computations  however  provide a valuable framework for managing longer term balance sheet exposures and interest rate volatility trends 
at the end of  all measures of eve fell within the policy limits established via the asset liability management policy  as approved by the board of directors 
contractual obligations significant contractual obligations at december  are summarized in the following table payments due by period dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating lease obligations subordinated debt time deposits total off balance sheet commitments as of december   the corporation had unfunded commitments totaling million 
for details of these off balance sheet commitments  see notes to consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies included in part ii  item regulatory matters community and its affiliates are subject to periodic examinations by the various regulatory agencies 
these examinations include  but are not limited to  procedures designed to review lending practices  risk management  credit quality  liquidity  compliance and capital adequacy 
during  the federal deposit insurance corporation and the federal reserve bank conducted examinations of community and its banking subsidiaries pursuant to their regular  periodic regulatory reviews 
no comments were received from these various bodies that would have a material adverse effect on community s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
inflation community s ability to cope with the impact of inflation is best measured by its ability to respond to changing interest rates and manage non interest income and expense 
within its alco processes  the corporation manages the mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to limit the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
inflation also has a direct impact on non interest income and expense such as service fee income  salary and benefits expenses  and other overhead expenses 
inflationary pressures over the last several years have been modest  though more recent trends suggest the potential for emerging inflationary pressure 
management will continue to monitor the potential for inflation and its impact on the pricing of products and services 
performance review versus net income reached million  a increase from the net income of million reported in similarly  earnings per share reached per share  a improvement from the reported in return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe provided traditional benchmarks used to compare the relative operating performance of financial service companies 
at the end of  the corporation produced an roa of and an roe of  which was comparable to the performances of and  respectively  in the prior year 
the primary driver of performance in was loan and deposit growth 
while the opportunity for improved pricing and expanded interest spread was undermined by the compression of interest rates  community s ability to achieve organic growth  which includes market share penetration  resulted in an expansion of net interest income 
the corporation benefited from marketing efforts in its core markets and from its position as one of the larger franchises to sustain a deliberate and concentrated focus on central pennsylvania 
loans grew and deposits rose and such growth contributed substantially to a increase in net interest income 
interest income earning assets interest income was million in as compared to the million recorded in this represented growth of and was achieved despite the fact that earning asset yields declined from in to in from to  earning assets grew million  including million in loans 
such growth was offset by a slight decline in investment portfolio balances 
growth in loans accelerated during the year and was funded by normal runoff in the investment portfolio and by a million increase in the level of deposits  primarily in community s successful power checking offering 
as in recent years  loan growth was focused in the commercial and commercial real estate categories and was augmented by continued penetration of the consumer home equity market 
interest expense funding sources interest expense grew modestly during the year despite the overall growth in funding sources 
the overall cost of funding  like the yield on earning assets  declined from in to in this decline in the relative cost of funds substantially offset the impact of increased funding levels on interest expense growth 
interest expense rose from million in to just million in  a modest change of only million 
total interest bearing funding grew by million and  combined with the growth in non interest funds  provided substantially all of the funding needed for the million in loan growth 
consumer preferences for liquidity and flexibility resulted in an increase in community s popular power checking account offering  which grew by million and was the primary driver of overall deposit growth 
community continued to make strategic use of other forms of funding in order to meet the consistent demand for credit extension that occurred throughout the year 
during the year  community made efforts to strategically realign its balance sheet 
to this end  the corporation gradually reduced its dependence on selected short term funding sources  such as overnight fed funds  which are sensitive to increases in short term interest rates 
at various times during the year  community also increased its long term borrowings  which are composed principally of term funding available through the federal home loan bank programs 
this strategy permitted community to lock in longer term funds at or near a potential trough in the interest rate cycle 
interest spread and net interest margin as a result of rate trends and other dynamics specific to community s balance sheet  the corporation reported a modest decline in net interest spread from in to in  and a decline in net interest margin from to over the same period 
the decline in margin was also linked to the impact of reduced contribution from non interest funding sources  which declined from to 
non interest income the continued expansion of banking service offerings also provided an increase to revenue in the form of higher non interest income 
the more widespread acceptance of the overdrafthonor program and the success of other fee based product distribution initiatives  including annuity sales  brokerage services and insurance related commissions  provided measurable revenue expansion and income stream diversification 
community also recorded substantial increases in gains from the sale of portfolio securities  primarily gains from the sale of bank stocks 
recognition of these gains was coordinated with expanded marketing efforts to increase the visibility of the community franchise 
community also decided to sell its credit card portfolio at a gain 
the maturity of the mono line credit card industry  combined with the relatively small size of the corporation s portfolio  created overwhelming competitive and scale disadvantages that precipitated the sale 
offsetting these gains and other revenue expansion trends was the impact of subdued mortgage refinancing activity 
industry wide  gains and fees from home mortgage refinancing declined 
at the same time  purchase activity waned in the wake of a tepid economy and the concern over higher interest rates 
complementary fee based activities  such as title and settlement services  also receded  due in some measure to the outsized mortgage origination activity experienced in previous years 
the net effect of these offsetting trends was a increase in income from non interest sources excluding security gains  and an increase excluding nonrecurring gains from both years 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million  which was only slightly higher than the provision of million recorded in the relationship of the allowance to loan losses declined  albeit modestly  from in to in community has experienced steadily improving metrics in loan quality  including net charge offs to loans of only in at the same time  the coverage of problem credits provided by the allowance reached 
as a consequence of these favorable trends  the increase in the provision for loan losses grew modestly  despite substantial growth in loan balances 
non interest expenses aggregate non interest expenses grew to million in compared to in  an increase of million or 
the pace of growth in non interest expenses was influenced by additional expenses from those businesses acquired in that were integrated with existing financial service activities 
because represented the first full year of operations for these businesses  half of the growth in non interest expenses was directly attributable to the incremental expenses incurred from partial year to full year 
excluding the growth attributed to the full year absorption of expenses from acquired businesses  adjusted year over year increases totaled million 
this increase represented a more modest increase in operating expenses from non interest expenses in were also adversely impacted by increased marketing efforts  including both image and product specific advertising 
community  like most publicly traded companies  also experienced another layer of regulatory burden in the form of compliance costs arising out of the sarbanes oxley act of sox  including specific increases associated with section of sox 
despite these challenges  overall operating expenses grew only modestly as a result of close management of incremental spending during concern over the impact of a compressed margin and less robust non interest revenue projections in areas like mortgage banking necessitated more proactive and strategic cost control efforts  including temporary delays of office openings originally planned for income taxes grew from million in to million in  an increase of nearly 
this increase was commensurate with the increase in pretax income  resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately in both years

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a portion of the information related to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is included under management s discussion and analysis md a under the heading of asset liability management and liquidity 
the purpose of this presentation is to augment the discussion contained in md a 
market risk is defined as the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments pursuant to factors arising out of the various categories of market risk 
market risk can include a number of categories  including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  etc 
for domestic  community based banks  the vast majority of market risk is related to interest rate risk 
financial institutions use a number of techniques to attempt to measure the impact of interest rate risk which includes gap analysis  interest rate shock simulation and economic value of equity 
each of these techniques is used to help quantify market risk attributable to the inherent sensitivity of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments are different  creating a risk that changes in the level of market interest rates will result in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  community s interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities  and off balance sheet financial instruments 
community s exposure to interest rate sensitivity is managed primarily through community s strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which generate favorable earnings  while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates 
since community s primary source of interest bearing liabilities is customer deposits  its ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits may be somewhat limited by customer preferences in the market areas in which it operates 
borrowings  which include federal home loan bank fhlb advances and short term loans  subordinated notes  and other short term and long term borrowings  are generally structured with specific terms which in management s judgment  when aggregated with the terms for outstanding deposits and matched with interest earning assets  mitigate community s exposure to interest rate sensitivity 
the rates  terms and interest rate indices of community s interest earning assets result primarily from its strategy of investing in loans and securities a substantial portion of which have adjustable rate terms which permit community to limit its exposure to interest rate sensitivity  together with credit risk  while at the same time achieving a positive interest rate spread compared to the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the following table provides a measure of interest rate sensitivity for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  interest rate sensitivity at december  year dollars in thousands days days days or more total assets interest bearing deposits in other banks loans held for sale investment securities loans a earning assets non earning assets total assets liabilities savings time time in denominations of  or more short term borrowings long term debt subordinated debt interest bearing liabilities other liabilities and equity total liabilities and equity interest sensitivity gap periodic cumulative cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets a includes non accrual loans 
community seeks to maximize net interest income and minimize earnings volatility by managing the level of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity is influenced by the repricing characteristic of both assets and liabilities and includes the volume of assets and liabilities repricing  the timing of repricing and the relative magnitude of the repricing 
while gap measurement provides an important tool to quantify the level of interest rate sensitivity at a specific point in time  its utility is constrained by the inherent limitations of gap measurement for a number of reasons 
first  changes in the level of interest rates cannot be expected to affect all assets and liabilities equally nor will they all be impacted at the same time 
second  assets and liabilities that are eligible to be repriced within a specific time frame may  in fact  not reprice or may not reprice to the same extent 
third  the measurement of gap is inherently limited in that it provides a representation of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities at a specific point in time while actual sensitivity of assets and liabilities are undergoing constant change 
finally  much of the presentation of gap is  by necessity  based upon estimates and assumptions for certain assets and liabilities 
for example  savings  now accounts  and other forms of core deposits do not have defined maturities or repricing dates and therefore require estimates to be made based upon historical deposit decay rate analysis or other forms of approximation 
interest rate sensitivity and the measurement thereof are also influenced by the optionality of certain earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for example  a substantial portion of community s loans and mortgage backed securities and residential mortgage loans contain significant embedded options  which permit the borrower to prepay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity prepayments without penalty 
a loan s propensity for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current interest rate and interest rate index if any of the loan  the financial ability of the borrower to refinance  the economic benefit to be obtained from refinancing  availability of refinancing at attractive terms  as well as economic and other factors in specific geographic areas which affect the sales and price levels of residential property 
in a changing interest rate environment  prepayments may increase or decrease on fixed and adjustable rate loans pursuant to the current relative levels and expectations of future short and long term interest rates 
investment securities  other than mortgage backed securities and those with early call provisions generally do not have significant embedded options and repay pursuant to specific terms until maturity 
while savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice  a continuing relationship with such customers is generally predictable resulting in a dependable and uninterrupted source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  while term fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes have prepayment penalties  which discourage customer withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment by community of fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes prior to maturity 
in addition to periodic gap reports comparing the sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in interest rates  management also utilizes a report which measures the exposure of community s economic value of equity to interest rate risk 
the model calculates the present value of assets  liabilities and equity at current interest rates  and at hypothetically higher and lower interest rates at one percent intervals 
the present value of each major category of financial instruments is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on prepayments  early withdrawals  weighted average contractual rates and terms  and discount rates for similar financial instruments 
the resulting present value of longer term fixed rate financial instruments is more sensitive to change in a higher or lower interest rate scenario  while adjustable rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in present value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates until the next interest rate repricing date 
the information provided by these analyses provides some indication of the potential for interest rate adjustment  but does not necessarily mean that the rate adjustment will occur or that it will occur in accordance with the assumptions 
despite these inherent limitations  community believes that the tools used to manage its level of interest rate risk provide an appropriate measure of market risk exposure 
the following table reflects the estimated present value of assets  liabilities and equity using the model for community as of december  at current interest rates and hypothetically  higher and lower interest rates of one and two percent
