all statements  trend analysis and other information contained in the following discussion relative to markets for our products and trends in revenue  gross margins and anticipated expense levels  as well as other statements including words such as anticipate  believe  plan  estimate  expect  and intend and other similar expressions  constitute forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and uncertainties  and our actual results of operations may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in itema 
risk factors as well as other risks and uncertainties referenced in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  warranty obligations  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and the related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of product to customers and the fulfillment of all contractual terms and conditions  pursuant to the guidance provided by sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
credit is not extended to customers and revenue is not recognized until collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contract period 
revenue from service administered by us that is not covered by a service contract is recognized as the services are provided 
in certain instances  we may sell products together with extended warranties or maintenance contracts 
the revenue recognized per element is determined by allocating the total sales price to each element  based on the relative fair values in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
separately priced extended warranty and maintenance products are accounted for over the life of the contract 
unearned revenue is reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of each customer 
where appropriate  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
when a customer s account balance becomes past due  we initiate dialogue with the customer to determine the cause 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position or other material events impacting their business  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount we expect to recover given all information presently available 
we will also provide a general reserve based on the aging of the accounts and notes receivable based on historical experiences of write offs 
as of july   our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million 
we believe our reported allowances at july   are adequate 
if the financial conditions of those customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances that would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology equipment  we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
as of july   our inventory of million is stated net of inventory reserves of million 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional inventory reserves may be required 
fair value of financial instruments 
carrying amounts of the our financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short term nature of these instruments 
the fair value of marketable securities is based on quoted market prices 
product warranties 
our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance of our products over a specified period of time at no cost to our customers 
our policy is to establish warranty reserves at levels that represent our estimate of the costs that will be incurred to fulfill those warranty requirements at the time that revenue is recognized 
we believe that our recorded liability at july   is adequate to cover our future cost of materials  labor and overhead for the servicing of our products sold through that date 
if actual product failures or material or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  our warranty liability would need to be revised accordingly 
stock based compensation 
effective july   we implemented the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas no 
r and staff accounting bulletin sab for all share based compensation that was not vested as of july  we adopted sfas no 
r using a modified prospective application  as permitted under sfas no 
r 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
under this application  we were required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award the fair value of each option sars award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model incorporating various assumptions 
expected volatility is determined using both current and historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which is obtained from public data sources 
the expected life of the options is based on historical observations adjusted for the estimated exercise dates of unexercised options sars 
additionally  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the average risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury security rate with a term to maturity that approximates the option s expected life as of the grant date 
the forfeiture rate is based on historical experience as well as future expectations 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from from these estimates 
prior to july   we followed the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the provisions of sfas no 
allowed companies to either expense the estimated fair value of stock options or to continue to follow the intrinsic value method set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  but disclose the pro forma effects on net income loss had the fair value of the options been expensed 
we elected to apply apb in accounting for its stock option incentive plans 
in accordance with apb and related interpretations  compensation expense for stock options is recognized in income based on the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date of the award or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
generally  the exercise price for stock options granted to employees equals or exceeds the fair market value of the common stock at the date of grant  thereby resulting in no recognition of compensation expense 
for awards that generate compensation expense as defined under apb  the company calculates the amount of compensation expense and recognizes the expense over the vesting period of the award 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we can reasonably estimate these costs 
restructuring 
we record restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation or relocation of operations  exited business lines  or shutdowns of specific sites 
these restructuring charges  which reflect our commitment to a termination or exit plan that will begin within twelve months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with site closure  legal matters  contract terminations  or other costs directly related to the restructuring 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a credit to earnings will be recognized 
taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we recognize deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  calculated using enacted tax rates for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return 
realization is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in future years 
management continually evaluates the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets based on the probability of realization determined by expectations for future taxable income and other factors 
although realization is not assured  based on available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that the full amount of the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
however  the amount realizable could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
overview we research  develop  manufacture  market  sell and service lasers and light based products used to perform aesthetic and cosmetic procedures 
we sell our lasers and light based products principally to medical practitioners 
candela markets its products directly and through a network of distributors to end users 
our traditional customer base includes plastic and cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists 
more recently  we have expanded our sales to a broader group of practitioners consisting of general practitioners and certain specialists including obstetricians  gynecologists  and general and vascular surgeons 
we derive our revenue from the sale of lasers  light based devices  and other products  and product related services 
we sell products worldwide through our direct sales force and independent distributors 
we typically assemble products in our wayland  massachusetts  facility in the quarter in which they are shipped  and backlog has not been significant 
we experience some seasonal reduction of our product sales in our first fiscal quarter due to the summer holiday schedule of physicians and their patients 
our products are generally covered by a standard warranty  with an option to purchase extended warranty contracts at the time of product sale or service contracts after the time of sale 
distributor sales generally include a parts warranty only 
the anticipated cost associated with the standard warranty coverage is accrued at the time of shipment as a cost of sales 
any costs associated with product installation are also recognized as costs of sales 
both such anticipated and actual costs have no associated revenue and therefore reduce the gross profit from product related service revenue 
product related service revenue consists of revenue from maintenance and repair services and the sale of spare parts and consumables 
we derive revenue from extended service contracts  which are typically for a or month period  and the revenue is initially deferred and recognized over the life of the service contract 
in addition  we provide on site service worldwide on a time and materials basis directly or through our distributors

other income expense 
total other income increased million for the fiscal year to million  from million for the fiscal year this increase is related primarily to interest earned from the increase in our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and long term investments and an increase in interest rates 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes results from a combination of activities of both the domestic and foreign subsidiaries 
the company recorded a effective tax rate for the year ended july  compared to a effective tax rate for the year ended july  the provision for income taxes for the year ended july   includes a tax provision calculated for taxable income generated at the foreign subsidiaries at rates in excess of the united states statutory tax rate

this increase accounted for approximately million in additional expense 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million or of revenue during fiscal compared to million or during fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to the increase in the number of marketing programs  the implementation of the sarbanes oxley act internal controls and reporting requirements  and an increase in the number of personnel on a worldwide basis 
other income expense 
total other income decreased million for the fiscal year ended july  to million  from million for the fiscal year ended june  this decrease is related to the absence of one time gains of million during fiscal from an insurance reimbursement of approximately million for stolen merchandise at our german subsidiary  period gains on subsidiary transactions of approximately million  and the timing of an investment distribution  partially offset by an increase in interest income of million due to an increased rate of return  coupled with a higher cash balance during fiscal income taxes 
the provision for income taxes results from a combination of activities of both the domestic and foreign subsidiaries 
we recorded a effective tax rate for the year ended july  compared to a effective tax rate for the year ended july  the provision for income taxes for the year ended july   includes a tax provision calculated for taxable income generated in japan and spain at rates in excess of the us statutory tax rate 
discontinued operations on september  management initiated a plan to close its only remaining skin care center 
the closure is accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities

the sublessee commenced making payments to the landlord during december of as a result of these and future payments scheduled under the sublease  we revised the estimated future costs associated with the boston facility and  in the fiscal year  reversed approximately of the restructuring reserve 
this reversal represents the aforementioned anticipated economic benefit due to sublessee payments of  net of legal and other fees of approximately and income taxes of approximately liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities at july  totaled million compared with million at july  we continue to have no long term debt 
we believe that the combination of existing cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities on hand  along with cash to be generated by future operations and amounts available under our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot be sure that we will not require additional capital beyond the amounts currently forecasted by us  nor that any such required additional capital will be available on reasonable terms  if at all  as it becomes required 
cash provided by operating activities amounted to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal this decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to an increase in inventories to support the increase in revenue 
cash used by investing activities amounted to million compared to million for fiscal this increase reflects the purchase of held to maturity investments 
cash provided by financing activities amounted to million for the fiscal year compared to million for the prior year 
the increase reflects proceeds from the issuance of stock to employees under the existing stock option plan and resulting tax benefits 
debt instruments and related covenants we maintain a renewable  revolving credit agreement with a major bank with interest at the bank s base rate of libor plus 
any borrowings outstanding under the line of credit are due on demand or according to a payment schedule established at the time funds are borrowed 
the line of credit is unsecured 
the agreement contains restrictive covenants limiting the establishment of new liens  and the purchase of margin stock 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit as of july  or july  off balance sheet arrangements our only off balance sheet arrangements consist of non cancelable operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and the license agreement with the regents 
the table below in the next section titled contractual obligations shows the amounts of our operating lease commitments and purchase commitments payable by year 
for liquidity purposes  we choose to lease our facilities and automobiles instead of purchasing them 
contractual obligations in august  candela obtained exclusive license rights to the dcd subject to certain limited license rights of cool touch  inc cool touch in the following fields of use procedures that involve skin resurfacing and rejuvenation  vascular skin lesions  and laser hair removal 
cool touch  a subsidiary of new star technology  inc obtained a license to the dcd on a co exclusive basis with candela  in certain narrower fields of use 
cool touch is restricted in its ability to assign its license rights to certain existing competitors of candela 
candela is entitled to one half of all royalty income payable to the regents from cool touch 
under the amended agreement  candela no longer is required by the regents to negotiate sublicenses to third parties 
however  candela is entitled to one half of all royalties due from any other entity that licenses the dcd technology from the regents in other fields of use 
we recognized royalty expense of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  based on the license agreement with the regents 
included in the fiscal expense of million is million of expense for the third quarter charge taken related to the regents arbitration decision 
of that million  million related to fiscal  million related to fiscal and million related to prior years see note

the requirements are effective for us beginning in fiscal adoption of the statement will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements to the extent that we change our accounting principles in the future 
in june  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods  and expanded disclosure requirements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently in the process of assessing the impact that fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have cash equivalents and marketable securities that primarily consist of money market mutual funds  certificates of deposit  us government securities and fixed income corporate securities 
the majority of these investments have maturities within one to five years 
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal due to the term and type of our investments and those fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have international subsidiaries that transact business in both local and foreign currencies and therefore we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currencies 
this risk could adversely impact our results and financial condition 
from time to time  we may enter into foreign currency exchange and option contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk and variability in operating results due to fluctuation in exchange rates underlying the value of current transactions and anticipated transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these contracts obligate us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates 
these contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying transactions are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date that approximate the value and expected settlement date  respectively  of the underlying transactions 
unrealized gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period  resulting from changes in the fair value of these contracts  are recognized in earnings generally in the same period as exchange gains and losses on the underlying foreign denominated receivables are recognized 
we do not engage in foreign currency speculation 
we had three forward exchange contracts outstanding serving as a hedge of our euro and yen denominated intercompany receivables in the notional amount of approximately million euros and million yen at july  these contracts serve as hedges of a substantial portion of our euro denominated and yen intercompany balances 
the fair value of the foreign currency derivative contract outstanding at july  was approximately million resulting in an unrealized gain of  any gains and losses on the fair value of the derivative contract would be largely offset by losses and gains on the underlying transaction
