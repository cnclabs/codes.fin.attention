item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following section addresses aspects of noven s financial condition and results of operations 
the contents of this section include an executive summary of our results of operations  an overview of noven and our novogyne joint venture  a review of certain items that may affect the historical or future comparability of our results of operations  an analysis of our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources  an outlook that includes our current financial guidance for  a discussion of how we apply our critical accounting estimates  and a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with noven and novogyne s financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this form k 
executive summary the highlights of our results in included improvement in product sales of our ht patches  strong performance at our novogyne joint venture  and progress made toward the regulatory approval of daytrana  including the receipt of an approvable letter from the fda and the commencement of daytrana inventory production in december in february  we provided the fda with a resubmission to the daytrana nda intended to address the issues presented in the approvable letter 
in march  the fda advised us that our resubmission was complete and that april  had been established as the user fee goal date for the fda to complete its review of the resubmission 
the most significant negative development during was the fda s determination that our fentanyl anda was not approvable 
as a result of this determination  we wrote off the fentanyl inventories manufactured while the anda was pending at the fda  resulting in an aggregate million in charges to our cost of products sold in the second half of we also agreed in december to terminate those aspects of our collaboration with endo that related to fentanyl  resulting in the recognition of million of fentanyl deferred license revenues 
the net effect of the fentanyl inventory charges and the recognition of fentanyl deferred license revenues was to reduce our income before income taxes by approximately million 
noven s net revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of compared to the prior year 
product revenues increased to million 
contract and license revenues increase to million  largely due to the recognition of the fentanyl deferred license revenues referenced above 
novogyne s profit contribution to noven in was million  a increase compared to the prior year 
including the fentanyl inventory write off charges and the recognition of fentanyl deferred license revenues  diluted earnings per share for was compared to in at novogyne  net revenues increased to million and net income increased to million 
vivelle dot net sales exceeded million for the first time  and vivelle dot total prescriptions increased compared to driven by the growth of prescriptions for 
table of contents vivelle dot total prescriptions for novogyne s products  taken as a whole  increased in compared to the prior year 
the foregoing executive summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations appearing in this item as well as noven s and novogyne s financial statements and the related notes included in this form k 
overview of noven and our novogyne joint venture we develop and manufacture advanced transdermal patches and presently derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of transdermal patches for use in menopausal hormone therapy 
in the united states  our ht products are marketed and sold by novogyne pharmaceuticals  the joint venture that we formed with novartis in our business  financial position and results of operations currently depend largely on novogyne and its marketing of our three principal ht products vivelle dot  vivelle and combipatch in the united states 
a discussion of novogyne s results and their impact on our results can be found under the caption results of operations equity in earnings of novogyne 
in all countries other than the united states  canada and japan  we have licensed the marketing rights to these products to novartis pharma  which is an affiliate of novartis 
in most of these markets  vivelle is marketed under the brand name menorest  vivelle dot is marketed under the brand name estradot and combipatch is marketed under the brand name estalis 
we hold a equity interest in novogyne  and novartis holds the remaining equity interest 
under the terms of the joint venture agreements  we manufacture and supply vivelle dot  vivelle and combipatch to novogyne  perform marketing  sales and promotional activities  and receive royalties from novogyne based on novogyne s sales of et products 
novartis distributes vivelle dot  vivelle and combipatch and provides certain other services to novogyne  including contracting with the managed care sector  and all regulatory  accounting and legal services 
novartis is entitled to an annual million preferred return from novogyne  which has the effect of reducing our share of novogyne s income in the first quarter of each year 
after the annual preferred return to novartis  our share of novogyne s income increases as product sales increase  subject to a maximum of 
our share of novogyne s income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the income we recognize from novogyne is a non cash item 
any cash we receive from novogyne is in the form of cash distributions declared by novogyne s management committee to distribute our equity earnings 
accordingly  the amount of cash that we receive from novogyne in any period may not be the same as the amount of income we recognize from novogyne for that period 
in  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  in cash distributions from novogyne  which accounted for a substantial portion of our net cash flows provided by operating activities for these periods 
we expect that a significant portion of our earnings and cash flow for the next several years will be generated through our interest in novogyne  but we cannot assure that novogyne will continue to be profitable or make cash distributions 
any failure by novogyne to remain profitable or to continue to make distributions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the market for ht products  including our transdermal ht products  has contracted since the july publication of the whi study that found adverse health risks associated with ht products 

table of contents comparing the second quarter of the quarter immediately preceding the publication of initial data from the whi study to the fourth quarter of  total prescriptions dispensed in the ht market in the united states decreased by 
for the same period  aggregate prescriptions for noven s united states ht products decreased 
the estrogen segment of the ht market in the united states declined  while our vivelle line of products increased 
vivelle dot  which represented of our total united states prescriptions in the fourth quarter of  increased from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter of we believe vivelle dot patch prescriptions have benefited from patient conversions from the original vivelle product  which represented approximately of our total united states prescriptions in the fourth quarter of manufacturing of vivelle is expected to be discontinued by the end of united states prescriptions for our combipatch product which represented approximately of our total united states prescriptions in the fourth quarter of declined from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter of  while prescriptions for the total united states market for fixed combination hormone therapy decreased 
the combination therapy arm of whi involved an oral combination estrogen progestin product and  accordingly  the combination therapy segment of the ht market has experienced the most significant decrease 
further decreases for our combipatch product whether as a result of the whi studies  the production issues discussed below or otherwise could require novogyne which holds the combipatch marketing rights to record an impairment loss related to these marketing rights  which would adversely affect the results of operations of both noven and novogyne 
see critical accounting estimates investment in novogyne 
certain items that may affect historical or future comparability stock options as a result of recent changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  in and thereafter  our statements of operations will include significant expenses associated with equity compensation that we were not required to include in and prior periods 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which requires compensation expense associated with equity awards to be recognized in our statements of operations  rather than as historically presented as a pro forma footnote disclosure in our financial statements 
in order to reduce the future compensation expense that we would otherwise recognize in our statement of operations following adoption of sfas r  the compensation and stock option committee of our board of directors approved  during  the acceleration of vesting of certain stock options under the noven long term incentive plan 
as a result of this action  options to purchase approximately million shares of noven s common stock became immediately exercisable  including options held by noven s executive officers to purchase approximately  shares 
we recorded an immaterial charge to compensation expense during due to the acceleration of a nominal amount of in the money options 
as a result of the acceleration  during  approximately million of future compensation expense  net of applicable income taxes  was eliminated from our statements of operations and included in the pro forma footnote disclosure in our financial statements for including this amount  our total compensation expense presented in footnote disclosure  net of applicable income taxes  was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
at december   the unamortized compensation expense that we expect to 
table of contents record in future years related to outstanding unvested options  as determined in accordance with sfas r is approximately million before the effect of income taxes  of which million  million  million and million is expected to be incurred in   and  respectively 
we will also incur additional expense in future years related to new equity awards that may be granted in the future that cannot yet be quantified 
shire we have developed a transdermal methylphenidate patch for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with the proposed brand name daytrana 
global rights to the developmental product have been licensed to shire for payments of up to million  including million paid at closing of the license transaction in the second quarter of in and  shire conducted additional clinical trials that were intended to address clinical issues raised in the not approvable letter that we received from the fda in april relating to our nda for daytrana 
in june  we submitted an amendment to the nda that included these new trial results  and in december  we received an approvable letter from the fda for daytrana 
the approvable letter contains proposed revisions to labeling  as well as requests for data clarification  post marketing surveillance  and post marketing studies 
in february  we provided the fda with a resubmission to the daytrana nda intended to address the issues presented in the approvable letter 
in march  the fda advised us that our resubmission was complete and that april  had been established as the user fee goal date for the fda to complete its review of the resubmission 
in february  shire and noven agreed to reduce the amount shire may require noven to pay to repurchase the product rights to daytrana under certain circumstances  from million to million 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we have been recording reimbursements to shire for shire s direct costs and certain direct incremental costs incurred by noven as requested by shire in pursuit of daytrana regulatory approval 
these reimbursements have been recorded as a reduction of a portion of the million that is nonrefundable deferred license revenue previously received from shire million license payment less the million repurchase right 
because shire had made a significant investment related to licensing daytrana  shire wanted to manage the development program in order to advance daytrana toward approval 
therefore  we effectively agreed to reimburse shire a portion of shire s non refundable license payment for certain costs shire incurred directly in pursuit of approval 
furthermore  due to the fact shire requested that we incur certain direct incremental costs in pursuit of approval  we treated such costs as reimbursements as well 
such reimbursements and direct incremental costs did not impact noven s research and development expenses in  or  although the reimbursements or amounts reimbursable to shire reduced and will reduce noven s cash position and also reduced and will continue to reduce the amount of deferred revenues that noven may recognize in future periods 
as of december   million remained in deferred license revenue  of which million is subject to shire s repurchase right and is therefore considered refundable 
we believe that future reimbursements to shire will not exceed the million  which is the remaining amount of non refundable deferred license revenue 
as described in more detail below under critical accounting estimates inventories pre launch inventories  as of december  our inventories include million of daytrana pre launch inventories 
if daytrana is not ultimately approved or this inventory is ultimately not commercially saleable  shire would bear the full cost of any inventory write off 

table of contents endo in july  we submitted an anda to the fda seeking approval to market a generic fentanyl patch 
in the first quarter of  we entered into an agreement with endo granting endo the exclusive right to market our fentanyl patch in the united states 
we received an up front payment of million from endo  of which million was allocated to license revenue for the fentanyl patch and the remaining million was allocated based on fair value to fund feasibility studies that seek to determine whether certain compounds identified by the parties can be delivered through our transdermal patch technology 
our agreement with endo provides that endo would fund and manage clinical development of those compounds proceeding into clinical trials 
in july  the fda issued a public advisory that it is investigating reports of death and other serious side effects from overdoses involving both the branded and generic fentanyl patches 
in september  the fda advised us that it did not expect to approve our anda and was consequently ceasing its review of our anda  based on the fda s assessment of potential safety concerns related to the higher drug content in our generic product versus the branded product 
the fda subsequently confirmed in writing that our fentanyl anda was not approvable 
we had agreed with endo that we would manufacture initial launch quantities of our fentanyl patch prior to receipt of final regulatory approval from the fda and that the parties would share the cost of any non saleable fentanyl inventories in accordance with an agreed upon formula 
as a result of the fda s decision to cease review of our anda  we deemed the entire million of fentanyl patch inventories to be non saleable and recorded a million charge to our cost of products sold in the third quarter of this charge represented the portion of the cost of the existing fentanyl inventories and purchasing commitments for raw materials allocable to us under the contractual formula 
endo was responsible for the remaining million of the fentanyl patch production costs  which they paid us in the fourth quarter of  less the million that we owed endo for fentanyl raw materials 
in addition  we incurred approximately million in costs associated with disposal and destruction of our fentanyl inventories in the fourth quarter of  which was charged to costs of products sold in that quarter 
see critical accounting estimates inventories pre launch inventories for information regarding our estimates and judgments related to pre launch inventories 
due to the fda s determination that our fentanyl anda was not approvable  noven and endo agreed in december to terminate the fentanyl portion of the license agreement as well as the fentanyl supply agreement between the parties 
as a result of the termination and the fact that we have no obligation to endo and no continuing involvement related to the fentanyl license agreement as of december   we earned the remaining million of previously deferred license revenue and recognized it as license revenue in the fourth quarter of we are currently evaluating the feasibility of reformulating the fentanyl patch to address the fda s concerns  however  no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully reformulate the patch  that a reformulated patch would be approved by the fda or that we would be able to successfully market a reformulated patch 
production issues we maintain in house product stability testing for our commercialized products 
this process includes  among other things  testing samples from commercial lots under a variety of conditions to confirm that the samples remain within required specifications for the shelf life of the product 

table of contents in  our product stability testing program revealed that certain lots of combipatch and vivelle dot patches did not maintain required specifications throughout the products shelf lives  resulting in product recalls of certain lots 
as a result  in  noven and novogyne established allowances for the return of recalled product  which had the effect of reducing noven s and novogyne s net revenues by million and million  respectively 
based on a review of available relevant information  including actual product returns and future expected returns  noven and novogyne reduced these allowances during  which had the effect of increasing net revenues for by million and million for noven and novogyne  respectively 
the effect on noven of these adjustments was to increase noven s income before income taxes by million in there are no remaining allowances at noven or novogyne related to the recall 
as a result of the stability failures  we initiated a series of special stability protocols to monitor commercial lots in distribution as well as future production 
in the first quarter of  a total of ten lots of vivelle dot manufactured in were identified for recall when one of our stability protocols revealed that these lots did not meet required specification or were associated with lots that did not meet specification 
the recall of these lots in the first quarter of did not have a material impact on noven s or novogyne s results of operations because an immaterial number of patches from these lots remained in distribution 
noven s marketing  general and administrative expense in included an allowance of million for estimated costs related to these recalls  which allowance was reduced by million during  based on the final close out of the recall 
a joint noven and novartis task force is working to identify the definitive root cause of the vivelle dot stability failures 
based on testing and analysis to date  we believe that the probable cause of the vivelle dot stability failures relates to certain patch backing material that we obtained from a raw material supplier 
if the root cause determination or additional testing indicates that the production issue affects more product than noven s current testing and analysis suggests  additional recalls may be required 
we continue to manufacture and ship vivelle dot to novogyne 
in october  our product stability testing program indicated that one commercial lot of combipatch product did not maintain required specifications throughout the product s shelf life due to the formation of crystals 
this issue is unrelated to the issue that led to the combipatch recall referenced above 
novartis recalled the affected lot 
the recall of this lot did not have a material impact on noven s and novogyne s financial results in either or we continue to manufacture and ship combipatch to novogyne 
in the fourth quarter of  special stability protocols put in place after the october combipatch stability failure indicated that certain lots of estalis a product substantially similar to combipatch and manufactured for sale outside the united states did not maintain required specifications throughout the product s shelf life due to the formation of crystals  resulting in the recall by novartis pharma of a total of three commercial lots of estalis 
we are investigating the cause of the stability failure 
the recall of these lots did not have a material impact on noven s financial statements in we continue to manufacture and ship estalis to novartis pharma 
we continue to maintain stability testing related to the foregoing production issues 
if our testing indicates that additional lots of our products or lots of products that have not previously experienced failures do not meet specifications  there could be additional recalls 
although noven and novartis work together in assessing production issues related to these products  the decision to recall product resides with novartis as the holder of the ndas for these products and is not within 
table of contents our control 
if our estimates concerning product returns associated with the recall are incorrect  or if our continued testing indicates that additional lots are affected  or if novartis should initiate additional recalls for any reason  then noven s and novogyne s business and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
among other things  any combipatch recalls could have a material adverse impact on the ability of novogyne to recover its investment in its combipatch marketing rights 
the recent recalls may result in an fda inspection of our facilities and procedures and we cannot assure that the fda will be satisfied with our operations and procedures  which could result in more frequent and stringent inspections and monitoring 
if the fda were to conclude that our manufacturing controls and procedures are not sufficient  we could be required to suspend production until we demonstrate to the fda that our controls and procedures are sufficient 

table of contents results of operations revenues total revenues are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change product revenues novogyne product sales royalties product revenues third parties product sales royalties total product revenues contract and license revenues contract license net revenues net revenues as described in more detail below  the increase in net revenues as compared to was attributable to an increase in license revenues related to endo  an aggregate increase in sales for our us and international products and an increase in royalties as a result of novogyne s higher sales of vivelle dot 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in contract revenues 
as described in more detail below  the increase in net revenues as compared to was primarily attributable to higher contract revenue due to the earning of certain product development milestones and an increase of product sales in the united states to novogyne 
in addition  net revenues in also benefited from a reduction in allowances for returns 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of our international products 
product revenues novogyne product revenues novogyne consists of our sales of vivelle dot  vivelle  estradot for canada and combipatch to novogyne at a fixed price for resale by novogyne primarily in the united states  as well as the royalties we receive as a result of novogyne s sales of vivelle dot and vivelle 
for additional information on the components of product revenues novogyne as well as our other sources of revenues  see critical accounting estimates revenue recognition 

table of contents the million increase in revenues from novogyne for as compared to primarily related to a million increase in unit sales of vivelle dot and a million increase in royalties 
this increase was offset by a million decline in unit sales of estradot for canada 
the increase in vivelle dot product sales and royalties was attributable to higher sales at novogyne due to increased prescription trends 
the decline in unit sales of estradot was primarily attributable to stocking orders in related to a planned transition from vivelle to estradot in canada 
price was not a factor contributing to the overall increase 
the million increase in revenues from novogyne for as compared to primarily related to million in higher sales of vivelle dot 
the increase in vivelle dot sales was primarily due to inventory reduction initiatives in the first half of intended to align inventories with post whi demand  which reduced our sales to novogyne during the period 
in addition  product revenues in included a million allowance for returns related to product recalls 
based upon our review and analysis of historical and expected future returns  we reduced this allowance by million in the net effect of these two events accounts for million of the increase in net revenues for as compared to these increases were offset by a million decline in combipatch product revenues  which reflect the continuing decline in prescription trends following the publication of the combination therapy arm of the whi study and other studies 
price was not a factor contributing to the overall increase 
product revenues third parties product revenues third parties consists primarily of sales of estradot  estalis and menorest to novartis pharma at a price based on a percentage of novartis pharma s net selling price subject to certain minima for resale primarily outside the united states and japan  together with royalties generated from novartis pharma s sales of vivelle and estradot in canada 
the million increase in product revenues from third parties for as compared to primarily related to million increase in unit sales and a million increase related to pricing 
the increase in unit sales was mostly attributable to million in higher sales of estalis 
we believe this increase was attributable to the timing of orders due to the re stocking of inventory in launched countries and not to an increase in underlying demand 
the million increase in revenue related to pricing was primarily due to the recognition of a higher price adjustment payment received from novartis pharma in compared to noven records such price adjustment payments from time to time upon novartis pharma s determination that its actual sales price of our product entitles us to receive amounts in excess of the minimum transfer price at which we initially sell the product to novartis pharma 
the million decline in product revenues from third parties for as compared to primarily related to million in lower unit sales of all products other than estradot 
the decline in sales reflected lower prescription trends following the publication of the combination therapy arm of the whi study and other studies 
in addition  novartis pharma indicated in that it had reduced orders for menorest in certain countries in anticipation of planned transitions to estradot 
these declines were partially offset by million in higher sales of estradot and an increase of million in royalties generated from novartis pharma s sales of vivelle and estradot in canada  which was mainly attributable to the collection in of royalties associated with through sales of estradot in canada that was previously being negotiated with novartis pharma 
the higher sales of estradot is related to an increase of million in price adjustment 
table of contents payments in  which were recorded upon determining that novartis pharma s sales price of estradot entitled noven to receive amounts in excess of the minimum transfer price 
the remaining increase in estradot is mostly attributable to higher unit sales 
contract and license revenues contract revenues consists of the recognition of payments received as work is performed on research and development projects 
the payments received may take the form of non refundable up front payments  payments received upon the completion of certain phases of work and success milestone payments 
license revenues consist of the recognition of non refundable up front  milestone and similar payments under license agreements 
the million decline in contract revenues for as compared to was primarily related to our recognition in of million in product development milestones under our collaboration with p g pharmaceuticals that did not recur in this decline was partially offset by million in contract revenues related to work performed in on development contracts 
the million increase in license revenue is mostly attributable to the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue balance related to our fentanyl agreement with endo 
the increase in contract revenues of million for as compared to was primarily attributable to million earned in in connection with our p g pharmaceuticals collaboration 
license revenues were consistent in and gross margin the following section presents noven s gross margin on an overall basis and also discusses gross margin for i novogyne related product revenues and ii third party related product revenues 
noven s overall gross margin and that related to third parties significantly declined in as a result of the write off of million of fentanyl pre launch inventories and associated destruction costs 
the following section includes a discussion of gross margins that excludes the effect of these fentanyl related charges in as well as the effect of our deferral of profits on products we sell to novogyne 
we believe such non gaap presentation is useful to investors in order to meaningfully evaluate noven s ongoing  underlying business and compare noven s financial results in to those in the prior year 
for the same reasons  management uses these non gaap financial measures to evaluate noven s ongoing  underlying business 
these measures should not be considered alternatives to measures computed in accordance with gaap  nor should they be considered indicators of our overall financial performance

excluding the fentanyl related charges and the changes in deferred profit  our gross margin was lower in this decrease resulted primarily from the increased costs for the expansion of manufacturing and operational capacity in anticipation of new product launches as well as increased personnel and other resources dedicated to quality control and quality assurance in our ht product line 
our unadjusted overall gross margin was lower in than in this decrease resulted primarily from the effect that our deferral of profits on products we sell to novogyne has on the amount of our gross margin from period to period  as is discussed in the following section 
excluding the impact of deferred profit  the increase in overall gross margin in as compared to is mainly attributable to the impact of the reductions in product recall reserves as discussed in more detail below

as a result of our equity investment in novogyne  we are required to defer of our profit on product that we sell to novogyne until that product is sold by novogyne to trade customers 
since our cost of products sold is adjusted to reflect changes in deferred profit  our gross margin can vary from period to period based on the timing of our shipments to novogyne and novogyne s sale of our products to trade customers 
if novogyne sells more product than we provide it in a given period ie  if novogyne s inventories decline  we will reflect less deferred profit from novogyne 
the amount of deferred profit has fluctuated significantly in the past three years  particularly in when novogyne reduced its inventory of our ht products after the publication of the whi studies 
in light of these fluctuations  we have included our gross margin related to novogyne excluding the changes in deferred profit on sales of product to novogyne 
noven s management believes that this presentation  for the reasons described above  is more meaningful and useful to an understanding of noven s underlying gross margin related to novogyne 
the decrease in gross margin related to novogyne  excluding the impact of deferred profit over the last two years  is primarily related to the increased personnel and other resources in our ht business as described above 
in addition  gross margin related to novogyne in as compared to was negatively impacted by the million reductions in of allowances for returns established in the decrease in gross margin related to novogyne in as compared to  was partially offset by the million net effect of the million reductions in of allowances for returns of million established in

the decline in gross margin related to third parties  excluding the impact of the fentanyl write off and associated destruction charges  over the last two years was primarily related to the expansion of manufacturing and operational capacity in anticipation of new product launches  which are expensed as incurred  as well as an increase in personnel and other resources in our ht business as described above 
this decrease was partially offset in both and in comparison to the respective prior year due to increases of million in and million in in price adjustment payments 
furthermore  gross margin related to third parties in further benefited from a million increase in product royalties  due to the collection and recognition in of royalties associated with through sales of estradot in canada

the million increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to a million increase in development engineering related to our methylphenidate and fentanyl patches  a million increase in clinical studies and a million increase in personnel costs 
the million increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to a million increase in development engineering related to our fentanyl patch  a million increase in pre clinical testing  and a million increase in personnel costs 
this increase was partially offset by a million reduction in clinical studies related to our methylphenidate patch 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  shire managed the development program in order to advance daytrana toward approval as discussed above 
marketing  general and administrative the million decline in as compared to was primarily attributable to a million reduction in professional fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and other regulatory requirements 
in addition  during  we reduced our allowance for costs related to product recalls by million  which were originally established with a million charge during this accounts for million of the decrease in marketing  general and administrative expenses for as compared to also  during  million was charged to marketing  general and administrative expenses related to the disposal of manufacturing equipment 
the decline in expenses was partially offset by a million increase in costs associated with expansion for anticipated new product launches  and a million increase in consulting and professional fees  primarily for human resource related projects 
the million increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to a million increase in compensation and employee benefit costs attributable to expansion for anticipated new product launches and a million increase in consulting  professional  legal  accounting and audit fees  a substantial portion of which relates to internal control requirements resulting from the sarbanes oxley act of and other regulatory requirements 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction of million in pre launch marketing expenses for our methylphenidate patch  which 
table of contents ceased in early as a result of the license of this product to shire  as well as a million reduction in recall related expenses 
other income and expenses interest income interest income is summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change interest income  net interest income increased million in as compared to and was primarily attributable to the investing of a portion of our cash into short term investments that yielded higher interest income  which primarily consist of investment grade  asset backed  variable debt obligations and municipal auction rate securities as well as an increase in interest rates 
interest income increased million in as compared to and was primarily attributable to a higher average cash balance during in comparison to as well as an increase in interest rates 
income taxes our effective tax rate was  and for  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes is based on the federal statutory and state income tax rates 
the decrease in our effective tax rate for as compared to the prior year relates primarily to a million reduction in accruals for outstanding internal revenue service irs audits due to the expectation of a more favorable outcome at that time 
net deferred income tax assets are measured using the average graduated tax rate for the estimated amount of annual taxable income in the years that the liability is expected to be settled or the asset recovered 
the effect of adjusting the expected tax rate related to the net deferred income tax assets is included in the provision for income taxes 
as of december   we had a net deferred tax asset of million 
realization of this deferred tax asset depends upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will be realized based upon estimated future taxable income 
equity in earnings of novogyne we share in the earnings of novogyne  after satisfaction of an annual preferred return of million to novartis  according to an established formula 
novogyne produced sufficient income in each of  and for us to recognize earnings from novogyne under the formula 
we report our share of novogyne s earnings as equity in earnings of novogyne on our statements of operations 

table of contents the financial results of novogyne are summarized as follows dollar amounts in thousands change change gross revenues sales allowances sales returns allowances sales and returns allowances net revenues cost of sales gross profit gross margin percentage selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income net income noven s equity in earnings of novogyne novogyne s gross revenues  which are calculated by adding sales allowances and sales returns allowances to net revenues  are discussed in this section because noven s management believes it is a useful measure to evaluate and compare novogyne s total sales from period to period in light of the significant historic fluctuations in novogyne s sales allowances and returns 
included in novogyne s costs of sales is the amortization of the marketing rights novogyne acquired for combipatch  which in prior periods was listed as a separate operating expense in novogyne s statement of operations 
novogyne revenues novogyne s gross revenues increased million for as compared to  primarily due to a million increase in sales of vivelle dot  partially offset by a million decline in sales of vivelle  a million decline in unit sales of estradot to an affiliate of novartis pharma in canada novartis canada  and a million decline in sales of combipatch 
approximately million of the vivelle dot increase was due to increased unit sales based on increased trade demand  while the remaining million increase related to price increases 
the decline in vivelle  our first generation estrogen patch  was mostly attributable to a decline in unit sales due to product maturity 
the decline in sales of estradot to novartis canada is primarily attributable to the timing of orders  as sales benefited from novartis canada stocking inventory as they transitioned from vivelle to estradot 
the lower sales of combipatch were due to a continuing decline in the market for combination therapies as well as the impact of a competitive product 

table of contents novogyne s gross revenues increased million for as compared to  primarily due to million in increased sales of vivelle dot and million in increased sales of estradot to novartis canada  partially offset by a million decrease in unit sales of vivelle and a million decrease in volume sales of combipatch 
we believe the increase in estradot sales to novartis canada was due to novartis canada stocking inventory as they transitioned from vivelle to estradot 
approximately million of the vivelle dot increase was due to price increases  while the remaining million increase related to increased unit sales based on increased trade demand 
the decline in volume sales of vivelle is primarily attributable to vivelle being in a declining trend due to product maturity 
manufacturing of vivelle is expected to be discontinued by the end of the lower volume sales of combipatch in were due to a continuing decline in the market for combination therapies after the publication of the combination therapy arm of the whi study

table of contents sales returns allowances consist of i changes in allowances for returns of expiring product  and ii changes in allowances for returns for product recalls 
the activity for sales returns allowances for the fiscal years ended december   and was as follows amounts in thousands current year provisions for returns of expiring product adjustment to prior year provisions for returns of expiring product benefits provisions for returns for product recalls sales returns allowances actual returns for expiring product actual returns for product recalls actual returns during the year ended the decrease in allowances for returns of expiring product for as compared to was primarily related to lower than expected returns as a result of a decline in actual returns of vivelle and vivelle dot in  offset by increased sales of vivelle dot 
as a result of this analysis  allowances related to prior years were reduced by million 
the increase in allowances for returns of expiring product for as compared to is primarily related to higher expected returns as a result of increased sales of vivelle dot as well as higher actual returns of vivelle 
as a result of this analysis  allowances related to prior years were increased by million 
as a result of the product recalls  novogyne recorded a million estimated returns reserve related to the announced recall as of december  during the latter part of and through december   million of actual returns associated with the recall were processed 
the remaining recall reserve of million was reversed to income in  as the fda closed out the recall 
novogyne gross margin the gross margin increase in as compared to was primarily related to lower sales returns allowances attributable to lower than expected returns as described above as well as higher sales of vivelle dot  which has a higher gross margin than other products sold by novogyne  and lower sales of estradot  which has a lower gross margin than other products sold by novogyne 
gross margin percentage in was comparable to that in novogyne selling  general and administrative novogyne s selling  general and administrative expenses declined million for as compared to  due to a million decline in sample expenses primarily attributable to the timing of sample orders by novogyne  a million decline in advertising and promotion expenses  and a million decline in ht litigation expense 
these declines were partially offset by a million increase in sales force expenses  and a million increase in professional services costs 
in addition  benefited from a million reduction in expenses associated with the co promotion of one of novartis products 

table of contents the increase in novogyne s selling  general and administrative expenses for as compared to was due to increased sales force costs  higher advertising and promotion expenses  a million increase in products liability insurance and million in ht litigation reserves established in the fourth quarter of  which was partially offset by a million estimated insurance recovery 
these increases were partially offset by decreased administrative expenses due to a new sales force automation system and reduced sample expenses primarily due to the timing of sample orders by novogyne 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  and december   we had the following amounts in thousands december  december  cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows amounts in thousands cash flows operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from the receipt of million in distributions from novogyne  partially offset by the timing of certain payments  including reimbursement payments of million to shire related to the development of daytrana  million for purchases of fentanyl  million for incentive compensation and related liabilities  and million related to insurance 
net cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from the receipt of an million license payment upon the closing of the endo transaction in february and million in distributions from novogyne 
the increase was partially offset by changes in working capital due to the timing of payments and receipts  specifically for payment of income taxes  expenses incurred in pursuit of regulatory approval for our methylphenidate patch  purchases of inventory for our fentanyl product  and amounts due from novogyne 
net cash provided by operating activities in primarily resulted from the receipt of a million license payment upon the closing of the shire transaction in april and million in distributions from novogyne 
the increase was partially offset by changes in working 
table of contents capital due to the timing and amount of product shipments  payment of director s and officer s insurance premiums and payment of income taxes 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was primarily attributable to million in net purchases of short term investments  as well as the purchase of million in fixed assets to expand production capacity for future products 
beginning in the first quarter of  noven invested a portion of its cash in short term investments  which primarily consist of investment grade  asset backed  variable rate debt obligations and municipal auction rate securities  which are categorized as available for sale under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
net cash used in investing activities in and was primarily attributable to the purchase of fixed assets to expand production capacity for future products and payment of patent development costs 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in and was attributable to million and million  respectively  received in connection with the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities for was primarily attributable to cash received in connection with the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the repurchase by noven of  shares of common stock 
short term and long term liquidity our principal sources of short term liquidity are existing cash  cash generated from product sales  fees and royalties under development and license agreements and distributions from novogyne 
for the year ended december   substantially all of our income before income taxes was comprised of equity in earnings of novogyne  a non cash item 
accordingly  our net income may not be reflective of our short term liquidity 
although we expect to receive distributions from novogyne  there can be no assurance that novogyne will have sufficient profits or cash flow to pay distributions or that novogyne s management committee will authorize such distributions 
our short term cash flow is dependent on sales  royalties  license fees and distributions associated with transdermal ht products 
any decrease in sales of those products by us or our licensees or any increase in returns of products to novogyne including any such changes resulting from the ht studies  the further decline of the ht market  or the inability or failure of novogyne to pay distributions would have a material adverse effect on our short term liquidity and require us to rely on our existing cash balances or on borrowings to support our operations and business 
as a result of the fda s decision to cease review of our anda for our fentanyl patch  we deemed the entire million of pre launch fentanyl patch inventories  as of september   to be non saleable and recorded a million charge to our costs of products sold in this charge represents the portion of the cost of the existing fentanyl inventories and purchasing 
table of contents commitments for raw materials allocable to us under the contractual formula 
endo was responsible for the remaining million of the fentanyl patch production costs  and paid us for their portion in the fourth quarter of less the million we owed endo for fentanyl raw materials 
in addition  in the fourth quarter we incurred million in costs associated with disposal and destruction of our fentanyl inventories 
due to the fda s determination that our fentanyl anda was not approvable  noven and endo agreed in december to terminate the fentanyl portion of the license agreement as well as the fentanyl supply agreement 
capital expenditures were million in  of which million represented landlord funded leasehold improvements to a leased facility 
we expect to continue to invest in capital expenditures during as we continue to expand our manufacturing and storage facilities for products under development  but we expect such expenditures to be significantly below levels 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures from our existing cash balances 
as a general matter  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity available to meet our operating needs and anticipated short term capital requirements 
during  we entered into an industrial long term lease the lease for approximately  square feet of newly constructed space located in close proximity to our manufacturing facility in miami  florida 
we are using the leased space for the storage and  as needed  the manufacture of new product 
the lease term is years  which may be extended for up to an additional years pursuant to four renewal options of five years each and a one time option to renew for one year 
the annual base rent is per square foot 
we also pay a monthly management fee equal to of the base rent 
the rent for the first year is discounted to per square foot 
the base rent is subject to annual increases of during the initial year term 
after the initial term  the rent will be of the fair market rate of the leased space as determined under the lease 
we improved the leased space in order to prepare it for its intended use during the landlord was responsible for up to approximately million of leasehold improvements  which were fully paid in any amounts paid to the general contractor in excess of this amount and any other leasehold improvements were our responsibility 
for accounting purposes  we are amortizing the expected rental payments on a straight line basis over the initial year term of the lease 
the renewal terms have not been included for amortization purposes because we cannot reasonably estimate the rental payments after the initial term and we cannot assure that we will renew the lease after the initial term 
leasehold improvements were recorded at cost and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvements or the initial year lease term 
leasehold improvements to the leased space paid by the landlord were recorded by us as a deferred rent credit and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the initial year lease term as a reduction of rent expense 
for our long term operating needs  we intend to utilize funds derived from the above sources  as well as funds generated through sales of products under development or products that we may license or acquire from others 
we expect that such funds will be comprised of payments received pursuant to future development and licensing arrangements  as well as direct sales of our own products 
we expect that our cash requirements will continue to increase  primarily to fund plant and equipment purchases to expand production capacity for new products 
if our products under development are successful  these expenditures  which may include an additional manufacturing plant  are expected to be significant 
we cannot assure that we will successfully complete the development of such products  that we will obtain regulatory approval for any such products  that any approved product may be 
table of contents produced in commercial quantities  at reasonable costs  and be successfully marketed  or that we will successfully negotiate future licensing or product acquisition arrangements 
because much of the cost associated with product development and expansion of manufacturing facilities is incurred prior to product launch  if we are unsuccessful in out licensing  or if we are unable to launch additional commercially viable products that we develop or that we license or acquire from others  we will have incurred the up front costs associated with product development or acquisition without the benefit of the liquidity generated by sales of those products  which could adversely affect our long term liquidity needs 
factors that could impact our ability to develop or acquire and launch additional commercially viable products are discussed under risk factors 
to the extent that capital requirements exceed available capital  we will seek alternative sources of financing to fund our operations 
no assurance can be given that alternative financing will be available  if at all  in a timely manner  or on favorable terms 
if we are unable to obtain satisfactory alternative financing  we may be required to delay or reduce our proposed expenditures  including expenditures for research and development and plant and equipment  in order to meet our future cash requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
aggregate contractual obligations the table below lists our significant contractual obligations as of december  amounts are in thousands less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations capital lease obligation purchase obligations total in the ordinary course of business  we enter into operating leases for machinery  equipment  warehouse and office space 
in addition  as noted above  in we entered into an industrial long term lease for approximately  square feet of storage space

table of contents outlook a summary of our current financial guidance is provided below 
this forward looking information is based on our current assumptions and expectations  many of which are beyond our control to achieve 
in particular  for purposes of this guidance we have assumed  among other things  that during there will not be any material transactions  changes in noven s or novogyne s accounting or accounting principles except as indicated below with respect to noven s method of accounting for equity compensation or any of the estimates or judgments underlying its critical accounting policies  regulatory  technological or clinical study developments  changes in the supply of  demand for  or distribution of our ht products including any changes resulting from competitive ht products  product recalls  or new ht study results  changes in our business relationships collaborations  or changes in the economy or the health care sector generally 
financial guidance is inherently uncertain 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will achieve results consistent with this guidance  and our actual financial results could differ materially from the expected results discussed below 
for a discussion of certain factors that may impact our actual financial results for the periods referenced  readers should carefully consider the risks  uncertainties and cautionary factors discussed above under the caption risk factors 
equity compensation expense 
effective as of the first quarter of  we adopted sfas r  accounting for stock based compensation 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations new accounting standards 
as a result  our statements of operations in and subsequent periods will include significant expenses associated with equity compensation that were not included in and prior periods 
based on the expense associated with equity compensation previously awarded  and our estimate of the expense associated with equity compensation that may be awarded in the course of  we estimate that our total equity compensation expense for will be in the million range 
on our statements of operations  equity compensation expense will be allocated among the various expense categories in which the compensation of the equity award recipients has historically been recorded 
as a result  certain expense categories including cost of products sold  research and development  and marketing general and administrative in future periods may reflect increases associated with the expensing of equity compensation 
the specific financial guidance provided below does not reflect any increases resulting from the expensing of equity compensation in potential daytrana revenues 
an amended nda for daytrana  our methylphenidate transdermal system  is currently pending at the fda 
although we received an approvable letter for daytrana in december  we are unable to predict when or if the nda will be approved 
if the nda is approved by the fda  our agreement with shire calls for us to receive an approval related milestone payment of million from shire the global licensee of the product and may also earn additional milestone payments of up to million depending on the level of shire s commercial 
table of contents sales of the product 
approval and sales milestones will be deferred and recognized as noven contract and license revenues on a quarterly basis through the first quarter of  which is our best estimate of the end of the product life cycle 
noven also expects to earn a profit on the ongoing manufacture and supply of finished product to shire 
ht product revenues 
given customer orders and forecasts for our ht products and other factors  for full year we forecast an aggregate increase in us ht product revenues led by sales of vivelle dot to approximately offset an expected aggregate decrease in international product revenues 
increased overhead 
over the past two years  we prepared our facilities and staffing for the production of fentanyl  daytrana tm and other developmental products 
our results of operations and gross margins for future periods are expected to be adversely affected by these preparations and related continuing overhead expenses unless and until we are able to improve the utilization of these resources through the commercialization of additional products 
during the same period  we increased personnel and other resources dedicated to quality control and quality assurance in our ht product line  which has contributed to an increase in the ongoing overhead expense associated with our ht business 
research and development 
we expect our research and development expense in to be at least equal to full year levels 
we are working to formulate certain new transdermal products that  if successfully formulated  may enter human studies during these studies  if initiated  would be funded by noven and would cause our research and development expense in to increase substantially over levels 
marketing  general and administrative expense 
for full year  we expect noven s marketing  general and administrative expense in to increase in the range over levels  reflecting in part anticipated increases in alliance management and information technology functions 
novogyne 
based on current prescription trends and other factors  we expect that novogyne s net revenues  net income and profit contribution to noven to increase for full year compared to levels 
effective tax rate 
we estimate that our effective tax rate for full year will be in the range 
capital expenditures 
we expect our capital expenditures for full year to decrease significantly compared to levels  with spending weighted more heavily in the first half of the year 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  the fair value of employee stock options  the determination of the net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset  estimates 
table of contents related to allowance for returns related to product recalls  accrued liabilities  income and other tax accruals  impairment of long lived assets and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
many of our critical accounting estimates are those which we believe require the most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain or which involve factors that may be beyond our control 
using different assumptions could result in materially different results 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates  the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting their application and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions  is as follows revenue recognition substantially all of our product revenues were derived from sales to our licensees  novogyne  novartis pharma and its affiliates and aventis 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss for the products is transferred to the customer 
certain of our license agreements provide that the ultimate supply price is based on a percentage of the licensee s net selling price 
each of those agreements also establishes a fixed minimum supply price per unit that represents the lowest price we are entitled to receive on sales to the licensee 
we receive the minimum price at the time of shipment with the possibility of an upward adjustment later when the licensee s net selling price is known 
revenues under these agreements are recorded at the minimum price at the time of shipment 
we record any upward adjustments to revenues at the time that the information necessary to make the determination is received from the licensee 
if the upward adjustments are not determinable  we record the adjustments on a cash basis ie when received 
these amounts are included in product revenues 
if our licensee s determination that upward adjustments to revenues prove to be incorrect or inaccurate our results of operations and financial position may be materially impacted 
we enter into certain contracts that have various terms and conditions that may have multiple revenue characteristics  including license revenues  contract revenues  product sales and manufacturing revenues 
as prescribed by eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we analyze each contract in order to separate each deliverable into separate units of accounting and then recognize revenues for those separated units at their fair value as earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition topic or other applicable revenue recognition guidance 
if each deliverable does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  the deliverables are combined and the amounts under the contract are allocated to the combined deliverables 
the appropriate recognition of revenue is then determined for the combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting 
the analysis prescribed by eitf requires us to make a number of significant assumptions and judgments  including those related to sales price  unit costs and manufacturing profit  expected launch date of the product licensed and valuation of that licensed product  and price  cost  and applicable profit of research and development work to be performed 
changes in any of these assumptions and judgments could lead to a different conclusion on what the separate units of accounting are and their applicable fair values  which may lead to material changes to revenue recognition 
license revenues consist of up front  milestone and similar payments under license agreements and are not recognized until earned under the terms of the applicable agreements 
in most cases  license revenues are deferred and recognized over the estimated product life cycle  which is management s best estimate of the earning period 
estimates of product life cycles are inherently 
table of contents uncertain as a result of regulatory  competitive or medical developments 
we estimate product life cycles based on our assessment of various factors  including the expected launch date of the product licensed  the strength of the intellectual property protection of the product  and various other competitive  developmental and regulatory issues  and contractual terms 
any change to the actual or estimated product life could require us to change the recognition period 
contract revenues consist of contract payments related to research and development projects performed for third parties 
the work performed by us includes feasibility studies to determine if a specific drug is amenable to transdermal drug delivery  the actual formulation of a specific drug into a transdermal drug delivery system  studies to address the ongoing stability of the drug in a transdermal drug delivery system and manufacturing of batches of product that can be used in human clinical trials 
we receive contract payments for the work we perform in the following forms nonrefundable up front payments prior to commencing the work or certain phases of the work  additional payments upon completion of additional phases  and in some cases  success milestone payments based on achievement of specified performance criteria 
for non refundable up front payments received prior to commencing work  we recognize revenue based on the proportionate share of the work performed by us in any given period based on the total hours we expect to incur on the project to deliver all our obligations under the contract as we believe direct hours spent on the projects is the best indicator of our delivery of the obligation and earning process for the contract 
there are a number of assumptions  estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the total hours we expect to incur on the project  including personnel and time involved 
similar assumptions  estimates and judgments are involved in determining the proportionate share of the work performed by us in any given period in addition to estimates of hours remaining to complete the project 
any changes in these assumptions  estimates and judgments may cause us to change the revenue recognition for contracts 
additional payments upon completion of additional phases and milestone payments are recorded when the specified performance criteria are achieved  as determined by the customer 
each contract may have different payment terms and each customer may vary in its determination that specified performance criteria are achieved 
therefore  the timing of revenue recognition may vary from contract to contract 
product revenues are net of an allowance for returns 
we establish allowances for returns for product that has been recalled or that we believe is probable of being recalled 
the methodology used by us to estimate product recall returns is based on the distribution and expiration dates of the affected product and overall trade inventory levels 
these estimates are based on currently available information  and the ultimate outcome may be significantly different than the amounts estimated given the subjective nature of the assumptions and complexities inherent in this area and in the pharmaceutical industry 
for example  during novartis initiated recalls of certain lots of combipatch and vivelle dot due to production issues 
our revenues for are net of approximately million and million in deductions for allowances for returns at noven and novogyne  respectively 
based on a review of available information  including actual product returns and remaining future expected returns  noven and novogyne reduced these allowances during  which had the effect of increasing net revenues for by million and million for noven and novogyne  respectively 
the effect on noven of these adjustments by noven 
table of contents and novogyne was to increase noven s income before income taxes by million for the effect on novogyne of novogyne s adjustment was to increase novogyne s income before income taxes by million for if our estimate concerning the amount of the product returns is incorrect or if novartis should initiate further unexpected recalls  then our results of operations could be materially different 
fair value of stock options until december  we elected to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options as allowed pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
accordingly  no compensation expense related to the granting of stock options has been recognized for the years ended december   and as noted in the section new accounting standards  in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation sfas r that requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
had compensation cost for our stock option plans been determined on the basis of fair value at the grant date for awards under those plans  consistent with this statement and using our existing valuation method for our employee stock options  the black scholes option pricing model  we estimate that our net income for the years ended december   and would have been reduced by  and  respectively 
as noted above  we accelerated vesting of certain stock options during  which caused the amount of compensation expense calculated using the black scholes option pricing model to be significantly higher than in prior years 
furthermore  as stated in the section new accounting standards  we started applying this statement on january   which we expect will result in compensation expenses of approximately million not including tax effects in  based on option grants unvested and outstanding at december  the foregoing amount does not include compensation expense for any equity awards that may be granted after january  however  these calculations use option valuation models that use highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility 
therefore  our results of operations could be materially different if different assumptions are used 
in addition  the effect of applying the fair value method of accounting for stock options on reported net income for  and may not be representative of the effects for future years because outstanding options vest over a period of several years  additional awards may be granted in future years and the acceleration of certain unvested stock options in may not be repeated 
inventories inventories consist primarily of raw materials  work in process and finished goods for our commercial branded products and under certain circumstances may include pre launch branded and generic products 
inventory costs include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or fifo or market and as appropriate  we reflect provisions necessary to reduce the carrying value of our inventories to net realizable value 
we use a standard costing system to estimate our fifo cost of inventory at the end of each reporting period 
historically  standard costs have been substantially consistent with actual costs 
we determine the market value of our raw materials  finished product and packaging inventories 
table of contents based upon references to current market prices for such items as of the end of each reporting period and record a write down of inventory standard cost to market  when applicable 
we periodically review our inventory for excess items  and we establish a valuation write down based upon the age of specific items in inventory and the expected recovery from the disposition of the items 
a provision is established for the estimated aged surplus  spoiled or damaged products  and discontinued inventory items and components 
the amount of the provision is determined by analyzing inventory composition  expected usage  historical and projected sales information  and other factors 
changes in sales volume due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that could result in materially different amounts for provisions we establish 
we evaluate lower of cost or market separately for commercial and pre launch inventories 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  remaining shelf life and current and expected orders from our collaboration partners based on market conditions  including levels of competition 
pre launch inventories from time to time we may manufacture launch or commercial quantities of our branded or generic product candidates prior to the date that we anticipate that such products will receive fda final marketing approval or the satisfactory resolution of patent infringement litigation  if any  involving the product but after the successful completion of the clinical development program and the initial filing of regulatory documents with the fda 
we will capitalize pre launch quantities into inventories when we believe it is probable that i a future economic benefit will be derived from the commercialization of the product and or the risk of pre launch inventories is transferred to our collaborative partner  ii the fda will approve the marketing of the product  iii we will validate our process for manufacturing the product within the specifications that have been or will be approved by the fda for such product and iv particularly in the case of a generic product  we will prevail in any patent infringement litigation 
in evaluating whether it is probable that we will derive future economic benefits from our pre launch inventories and whether the pre launch inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  we consider  among other things  the remaining shelf life of that inventory  the current and expected market conditions  the amount of inventory on hand  the substance of communications with the fda during the regulatory approval process and the views of patent and or litigation counsel 
all of these criteria are re assessed each reporting period in connection with our determination on whether pre launch quantities of the applicable product are stated at lower of cost or market 
we make provisions through cost of goods sold to reduce pre launch inventories to their net realizable value 
we believe there are typically few risks and uncertainties concerning market acceptance of approved generic products because the branded product has an established demand  and a lower priced product may be substituted for that referenced brand product 
in the case of branded products  we generally transfer all or a portion of the risk of pre launch inventories to our collaborative partner 
the manufacture of pre launch inventories requires us to  among other things  begin to validate our manufacturing processes in accordance with fda regulations and the specifications for the product expected to be approved by the fda 
in order to be able to launch the product promptly upon the receipt of fda approval  we must commence the validation process well before the date we 
table of contents anticipate the product will be approved 
this process may entail a scale up process in which  we evaluate and  as necessary  modify the equipment and processes employed in the manufacture of the new product to efficiently manufacture the product 
we expense scale up activities  including the raw material used in such activities 
we capitalize direct and indirect manufacturing costs incurred during the manufacture of validation lots that we anticipate will be permitted to be sold by the fda as well as the manufacture of additional product to meet estimated launch demand 
the manufacture of pre launch inventories involves the risk that the fda may not approve such product s for marketing on a timely basis or at all  that each approval may require additional or different testing and or specifications than what was performed in the manufacture of such pre launch inventory and or that the results of related litigation may not be satisfactory 
if any of these risks were to materialize with respect to a given product or if the launch of such product is significantly postponed  we may record additional provisions  which could be material 
shelf lives of pre launch inventories generally exceed one year 
as of december  and  we had pre launch inventories pending final fda approval broken down as follows amounts in thousands work in process raw materials total pre launch inventories as of december  consisted of the daytrana product  which we  along with shire  believe will receive final fda approval and be commercially saleable in if daytrana is not ultimately approved or this inventory is ultimately not commercially saleable  our purchase orders from shire call for shire to reimburse noven the full cost of the inventory 
pre launch inventories as of december  consisted of noven s generic fentanyl patch 
as a result of the fda s decision to cease its review of our anda in september  we wrote off the entire fentanyl patch inventory  which was million at the time  with a charge of million to our cost of products sold  representing our portion of the costs of the inventory as agreed with endo 
income taxes accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that we not record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax asset 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax asset will be realized based upon our estimated future income and  accordingly  no valuation allowance for the net deferred income tax asset was deemed necessary as of december  subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
our future effective tax rate is based on estimates of expected income and enacted statutory tax rates  as applied to our operations 
significant judgment is required in making these determinations and the ultimate resolution of our tax return positions 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are correct  our policy is to establish accruals for tax contingencies that may result 
table of contents from examinations by tax authorities 
our tax accruals are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant such adjustment 
it is reasonably possible that our effective tax rate and or cash flows may be materially impacted by the ultimate resolution of our tax positions 
we are periodically audited by federal and state taxing authorities 
the outcome of these audits may result in noven being assessed taxes in addition to amounts previously paid 
accordingly  we maintain tax contingency accruals for such potential assessments 
the accruals are determined based upon our best estimate of possible assessments by the irs or other taxing authorities and are adjusted  from time to time  based upon changing facts and circumstances 
the irs audited our federal income tax returns for the years through we originally accrued million based on our best estimate of possible assessment by the irs at the time 
during  we reduced these accruals by million based on changing facts and circumstances 
during  the irs completed its audit of those years 
in reaching final settlement with the irs related to these tax years  we agreed to certain adjustments  primarily in the areas of research and development credits and to a lesser extent capitalization of software development costs and timing of depreciation and amortization 
as a result of the final settlement  we reassessed our income tax contingency accruals to reflect the settlement 
based upon this reassessment  we recorded an additional million reduction in these accruals during  primarily related to interest charges on potential assessments 
in addition  we paid the irs during for all amounts settled  not including interest charges related to the and tax years  as those interest charges were not yet calculated as of december  as of december   we had million in tax contingency accruals  related to these interest charges  which were paid in january in addition  as of december   we established million in tax contingency accruals related to certain state tax positions we have determined are more likely than not to be challenged by state taxing authorities and we believe do not meet the probable criteria of being upheld 
investment in novogyne we entered into a joint venture novogyne with novartis  effective may   to market and sell women s prescription healthcare products in the united states and canada 
we account for our investment in novogyne under the equity method and report our share of novogyne s earnings as equity in earnings of novogyne on our statements of operations 
we defer the recognition of of our profit on products sold to novogyne until the products are sold by novogyne 
intangible asset as of december   novogyne had a long term intangible asset of million related to the acquisition of the marketing rights to combipatch 
the amortization of this asset is included in cost of sales in novogyne s financial statements 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that novogyne record this asset at cost and that the asset be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
testing for impairment requires novogyne to estimate the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset and compare that amount to the carrying value of the asset 
this analysis requires novogyne to make a number of significant assumptions and judgments 
for example  estimates need to be made regarding prescription trends  sales price  unit cost and product life cycle among many other factors 
novogyne adjusts these assumptions from time to time based on new information as appropriate 
if this analysis indicates that a possible impairment exists undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value  novogyne would be required to 
table of contents estimate the fair value of the asset 
the determination of fair value of this asset would involve numerous uncertainties because there is no viable actively traded market for the marketing rights of a pharmaceutical product 
as permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  if novogyne would be required to estimate the fair value of the marketing rights  it would utilize a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis values an asset on the basis of the net present value of the cash expected to be generated by that asset over its estimated useful life 
this would require novogyne to apply a discount rate to the estimated undiscounted future cash flow of the asset 
a material change in any of the assumptions made by novogyne to calculate the discounted cash flows may require novogyne to record an impairment loss  which would adversely affect novogyne s operating results in the period in which the determination or allowance were made 
this would reduce our earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period and the amount of our investment in novogyne and could  depending on the size of the impairment  result in a loss at both the novogyne and noven level for the period in which the impairment occurred 
neither novogyne nor we are able to assure that estimates of future cash flows have reflected the ultimate effect of the discontinued and currently ongoing ht studies  the recalls affecting combipatch  the market share gains of a competitive combination ht patch  or the possible launch of additional combination ht therapies in  on the prospects for the ht market or the market for combipatch 
any adverse change in the market for ht products could have a material adverse impact on the ability of novogyne to recover its investment in combipatch which could require novogyne to record an impairment loss for that asset 
revenue recognition revenues at novogyne are recognized when all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which occurs at the time of shipment of products 
revenues are reduced at the time of sale to reflect expected returns that are estimated based on historical experience 
additionally  provisions are made at the time of sale for all discounts  rebates and estimated sales allowances based on historical experience updated for changes in facts and circumstances  as appropriate 
such provisions are recorded as a reduction of revenue 
these deductions represent estimates of the related obligations  requiring the use of judgment when estimating the impact of these sales deductions on gross sales for a reporting period 
these estimates for revenue deductions are derived utilizing a combination of information received from third parties  including market data  inventory reports from its major wholesale customers  historical information and other analysis 
the following briefly describes the nature of each revenue deduction and how the related accruals are estimated by novogyne the united states medicaid program is a state government administered program that uses state and federal funds to provide assistance to certain vulnerable and needy individuals and families 
in  the medicaid drug rebate program was established to reduce state and federal expenditures for prescription drugs 
under the rebate program  rebates are paid to states based on drugs paid for by those states 
provisions for estimating medicaid rebates are calculated using a combination of historical experience  product and population growth  price increases  the impact of contracting strategies and specific terms in the individual state agreements 
these provisions are then adjusted based upon the established re filing process with individual states 
for medicaid  the calculation of rebates involves interpretation of relevant regulations  which are subject to challenge or change in interpretative guidance by government authorities 
since medicaid rebates are typically billed up to 
table of contents six months after the product is dispensed  any rebate adjustments may involve revisions of accruals for several quarters 
novogyne s management believes that due to novartis extensive experience with medicaid rebates  it is able to reasonably estimate rebates 
the products also participate in prescription drug savings programs that offer savings to patients that are eligible participants under united states medicare programs 
these savings vary based on a patient s current drug coverage and personal income levels 
provisions for the obligations under these programs are based on historical experience  trend analysis and current program terms 
on january   an additional prescription drug benefit was added to the united states medicare program 
individuals who have dual medicaid medicare drug benefit eligibility had their medicaid prescription drug coverage replaced by the new medicare part d coverage  provided by private prescription drug plans 
the change will lead to a shift of plan participants between programs in which the products participate 
the estimated impact of this shift that is related to sales has been reflected in novogyne s sales accruals at the end of although the impact was relatively neutral to novogyne s products 
wholesaler chargebacks relate to contractual arrangements with certain indirect customers to sell products at prices that are lower than the list price charged to wholesalers 
a wholesaler chargeback represents the difference between the invoice price charged to the wholesaler and the indirect customer s contract discount price 
provisions for estimating chargebacks are calculated using a combination of historical experience  product growth rates and the specific terms in each agreement 
wholesaler chargebacks are generally settled within a few weeks of incurring the liability 
managed health care rebates are offered to key managed health care  group purchasing organizations and other direct and indirect customers to sustain and increase product market share 
these rebate programs provide that the customer receive a rebate after attaining certain performance parameters relating to product purchases  formulary status and or pre established market share milestones relative to competitors 
since rebates are contractually agreed upon  rebates are estimated based on the specific terms in each agreement  historical experience and product growth rates 
the sales performance of products subject to managed health care rebates and other contract discounts and levels of inventory in the distribution channel are tracked  and adjustments to the accrual are made periodically to reflect actual experience 
in order to evaluate adequacy of ending accrual balances  novogyne uses both internal and external estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time 
external data sources include periodic reports of wholesalers and purchased third party market data 
management internally estimates the inventory level in the retail channel and in transit 
it is customary in the pharmaceutical industry to allow returns of unused stocks within six months of shelf life expiry 
novogyne s policy is that no product will be shipped with less than nine months of remaining shelf life and novogyne generally will accept returns due to expiration within twelve months after the product has expired 
an allowance for estimated sales returns is recorded based on i the historical experience of actual product returns and ii the estimated lag time between when an actual sale takes place in relation to when the products are physically returned by a customer 
the historical actual returns rate is then applied to product sales during the estimated lag period to develop the returns estimate 
novogyne also considers trends and expectations for future demand and trade inventory levels 
these policies cause a significant lag time between when a 
table of contents product is sold and the latest date on which a return could occur 
novogyne believes this is a reasonable basis on which to estimate returns exposure and incorporates the key factors that contribute to returns 
in addition  novogyne establishes sales returns allowances for product that has been recalled or that it believes is probable of being recalled 
the methodology used to estimate product returns associated with recalls is based on the distribution and expiration dates of the affected product and overall trade inventory levels 
these estimates are based on currently available information  and the ultimate outcome may be different than the amounts estimated given the subjective nature and complexities inherent in this area and in the pharmaceutical industry 
novogyne s product supply policy is to maintain inventories on a consistent level from year to year based on the pattern of consumption 
wholesaler inventory levels are monitored monthly based on gross sales volume  prescription volumes based on third party data and information received from the key wholesalers 
based on this information  the inventories on hand at wholesalers and other distribution channels were estimated to be approximately one month at december  and novogyne believes the third party data sources of information are sufficiently reliable  however its accuracy cannot be independently verified 
cash discounts are offered to customers to encourage prompt payment 
cash discounts  which are typically of gross sales  are accrued at the time of sale 
other sales discounts  such as consumer coupons and discount cards  are also offered 
these discounts are recorded at the time of sale and estimated utilizing historical experience and the specific terms for each program 

table of contents the following table describes the activity for the revenue deduction accruals by major category for the year ended december  amounts in thousands income statement charge january  adjustments of current december  payments prior years year medicaid  medicare and state program rebates credits including prescription drug savings cards managed health care rebates chargebacks  including hospital chargebacks cash discounts  direct customer discounts other discounts sales returns allowances total novartis controls and maintains the reserves associated with such sales allowances and returns on behalf of novogyne and pays all monies owed and issues credits to individual customers as deemed necessary 
the contracts that underlie these transactions are maintained by novartis for its business as a whole and those transactions relating to novogyne are estimated by novartis 
based on an analysis of the underlying activity  the amounts recorded by novogyne represent novartis best estimate of charges that apply to sales by novogyne 
however  neither novogyne nor we can control novartis analysis of the underlying activity or its application of that analysis to novogyne 
if novartis materially changes the assumptions it uses in determining the reserve  novogyne may be required to record an additional reserve allowance on its financial statements  which would adversely affect novogyne s operating results during the period in which the determination or reserve were made  and would consequently also reduce the earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period 
novogyne is required to establish accruals for certain loss contingencies related to litigation 
novogyne accrues estimated legal fees and settlement costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
however  the estimation of the amount to accrue requires significant judgment 
litigation accruals require novogyne to make assumptions about the future outcome of each case based on current information  expected legal fees that will be incurred and any expected insurance recovery 
as of december   novogyne had litigation accruals of million  with an expected insurance recovery of million 
novartis controls and maintains the accruals associated with such litigation on behalf of novogyne and pays all monies owed for legal fees and settlements  as well as collects any insurance recovery 
the litigation accruals and estimated insurance recoveries are maintained by novartis for its business as a whole and those 
table of contents accruals and recoveries relating to novogyne are estimated by novartis based on claims specifically attributable to novogyne s products and novogyne s insurance policies 
based on an analysis of the underlying data  the amounts recorded by novogyne represent novartis best estimate of litigation accruals and estimated insurance recoveries relating to novogyne 
however  neither novogyne nor we can control novartis analysis of the underlying data or its application of that analysis to novogyne 
litigation and its outcome are inherently difficult to predict 
if novartis materially changes the assumptions it uses in allocating litigation accruals and any applicable insurance recoveries  or if actual outcomes are different from what has been estimated  novogyne may be required to record additional charges or reduce its accruals  which would affect novogyne s operating results during the period in which the determination  accrual or reduction were made  and would consequently affect the earnings attributable to our investment in novogyne for that period 
the critical accounting estimates discussed herein are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
new accounting standards in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  or wasted material spoilage 
sfas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the so abnormal criterion outlined in accounting research bulletin  chapter  inventory pricing 
sfas also introduces the concept of normal capacity and requires the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
unallocated overheads must be recognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we currently account for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight or wasted material spoilage as current period charges and allocate fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities and recognize unallocated overheads as an expense in the period in which they are incurred 
for the foregoing reasons  we do not anticipate that implementation of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which revises sfas  and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
and amends sfas no 
statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires companies to recognize in their income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and directors 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we adopted sfas r on january  this standard requires that compensation expense for most equity based awards be recognized over the requisite service period  usually the vesting period  while compensation expense for liability based awards those usually settled in cash rather than stock be re measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the award is settled 
because we recognized no compensation cost for equity based awards prior to the adoption of sfas r s fair value method  we expect sfas r will have a significant impact on our reported results of operations  although it will have no net impact on our overall financial position or cash flows 

table of contents we use the black scholes formula to estimate the value of stock based compensation granted to employees and directors and expect to continue to use this acceptable option valuation model in  but may consider switching to an alternative valuation model in the future  if we determine that such a model will produce a better estimate of fair value 
because sfas r must be applied not only to new awards  but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on the effective date  compensation cost for some previously granted options will be recognized under sfas r 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that statement would have approximated the impact described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as previously required 
we will follow the modified prospective method  which requires us i to record compensation expense for the non vested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding at the initial date of adoption and ii to record compensation expense for any awards issued or modified after january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas 
sfas eliminates the exception for exchange of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas is effective for non monetary assets and exchanges occurring in the first quarterly period beginning after june  as we have no present intention to engage in exchanges of non monetary assets  we do not anticipate that implementation of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and fas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle 
sfas also requires that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived non financial asset be accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in the first annual reporting period beginning after december  the implementation of sfas is not presently expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition and cash flows
