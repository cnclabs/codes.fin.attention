critical accounting estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require that management make numerous estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting the company s reported results of operations and financial position 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
certain accounting estimates  however  are considered to be critical in that i they are most important to the depiction of the financial condition and results of operations of the company and ii their application requires management s most subjective judgment in making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
customer sales and discounts and allowances the company gives allowances and offers various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers that are accounted for as a reduction of sales 
the company records estimated reductions to sales for price promotion discounts at the time the product purchased by the independent sales distributor is sold to the final retail customer distributor discounts at the time revenue is recognized coupon expense at the estimated redemption rate customer rebates at the time revenue is recognized cooperative advertising at the time the company s obligation to the customer is incurred product returns received from independent sales distributors price promotion discount expense is recorded when the related product being discounted is sold by the independent sales distributor to the retail customer 
the amount of the price promotion is captured in the handheld computer system when the independent sales distributor sells product to the retail customer 
the price promotion discount is based upon actual discounts per case based upon an approved price promotion calendar 
any variation in price discounts  which is recorded each month  is due primarily to the company selling more volume on discount than estimated 
independent sales distributors receive a purchase discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product sold to retailers and other customers  adjusted for price promotions and product returns 
direct retail customers receive a purchase discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product received 
discounts to distributors and retail customers are based on agreed upon rates  and amounts vary based upon volume 
coupon expense estimates are based upon the number of coupons dropped to consumers and the estimated redemption percentage 
the estimated redemption percentages are based on data obtained from the company s third party coupon processor  and its experience with similar coupon drops 
the estimate is updated monthly upon receipt of the actual coupon redemption report 
estimates for customer rebates assume that customers will meet the required quantities to qualify for payment 
if the customers fall above or below the estimate as the year progresses  this could impact the estimate 
cooperative advertising expense is recorded based on the estimated advertising cost of the underlying program 
product returns are recorded as product is returned to the company 
at quarter end  an estimated reserve for product returns is recorded based upon sales and actual return experience in the last month of the quarter 
actual returns may vary from this estimate 
a product return reserve is established based on the actual product returns that come in subsequent to year end 
some customers take deductions when they make payments to the company 
based on historical experience  it is the company s current policy to reserve for these deductions at the time they are taken by the customer 
if determined by the company that a deduction may not be valid  the deduction is evaluated with the customer and the reserve could be reversed 
since the company obtains updated information on every discount and allowance account each month  the risk that estimates are not properly recorded is generally limited to a percentage of one month s activity 
one month of discount and allowance activity was approximately million in historically  actual discounts and allowances have not varied significantly from estimates 
provision for doubtful accounts the company aggressively pursues collection of accounts receivable balances 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers financial condition and makes quarterly estimates of its ability to collect its accounts receivable balances 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management specifically analyzes accounts receivable trends and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  levels of customer deductions  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as a selling  general and administrative expense 
the allowance for doubtful accounts has three components 
the first component is a reserve against all accounts receivable balances based on the last five years of write off experience for the company 
the second component is for specific trade customer accounts receivable balances from customers whose ability to pay is in question  such as customers who file for bankruptcy while they have an outstanding balance due the company 
the third component is a reserve against any breached independent sales distributor accounts receivable balances that are not adequately covered by the independent sales distributor s equity in the route territory 
although the total allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the estimated risk for all customer balances  if any one of our top twenty customers accounts receivable balances became fully uncollectible  it would have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations and would negatively impact cash flow 
long lived asset impairment in accordance with sfas no  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in instances where the carrying amount may not be recoverable  the review for potential impairment utilizes estimates and assumptions of future cash flows directly related to the asset 
cash flow estimates are typically derived from the company s historical experience and internal business plans 
for assets where there is no plan for future use  the review for impairment includes estimates and assumptions of the fair market value of the asset  which is based on the best information available 
the company uses market prices  when available  and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
these assets are recorded at the lower of their book value or market value 
adverse changes in future market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset 
pension and postretirement plans accounting for pensions and postretirement benefit plans requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including discount rate  rate of return on plan assets  compensation increases  health care cost increases  and mortality and employee turnover 
a sensitivity analysis for pensions is included in note and a sensitivity analysis for postretirement benefits other than pensions is included in note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements in the company s annual report to shareholders 
licensed independent actuaries perform these required calculations to determine liability and expense in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in addition  the company may experience significant changes in its pension expense from year to year because of its election in to immediately recognize all pension gains and losses in excess of its pension corridor in the year that they occur 
for comparative purposes  this is relevant because most other public companies use an amortization method that allows recognition of pension gains and losses to be amortized over longer periods of time  up to years 
also  the final determination of the gains and losses that could potentially exceed the corridor is not known until the last day of the year  which makes it difficult to estimate 
the combination of low interest rates and low or negative rates of return on plan assets can cause higher levels of pension expense  conversely  high interest rates and high rates of return on assets could result in higher levels of pension income 
market conditions where interest rates and asset returns move inversely relative to each other  in most instances  cause the company to have pension expense or income within its allowable pension corridor 
actual results may differ from the company s assumptions and may impact the reported liability and expense amounts reported for pensions and postretirement benefits 
during long term corporate bond rates declined and overall pension asset returns were below the assumption 
as a result  the discount rate declined from at the end of to at the end of the company previously announced in november in form k and q that  in conjunction with the implementation of medicare part d in january  the company would no longer provide medical benefits for most of its post retirees 
in addition  incumbent retirees would pay age based rates for life insurance benefits in excess of as a result of these benefit changes  the projected benefit obligation was remeasured and the company estimates there will be a reduction in its other post retirement benefits opeb liability of approximately  which will be amortized over future periods 
in  the company estimates the amortization of this liability will result in a reduction of pre tax opeb expense of approximately  compared to fiscal year this will be primarily a non cash benefit 
workers compensation expense accounting for workers compensation expense requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding numerous factors  including the ultimate severity of injuries  the timeliness of reporting injuries  and health care cost increases 
the company insures for workers compensation liabilities under a large deductible program where losses are incurred by the company up to certain specific and aggregate amounts 
accruals for claims under the large deductible insurance program are recorded as claims are incurred 
the company estimates the liability based on total incurred claims and paid claims  adjusted by loss development factors which account for the development of losses over time 
loss development factors are based on prior loss experience and on the age of incurred claims  and are reviewed by a third party claim loss specialist 
the company s estimated liability is the difference between the amounts we expect to pay and the amounts we have already paid for those years  adjusted for the limits on the aggregate amounts 
the company evaluates the estimated liability on a continuing basis and adjust it accordingly 
included in the estimate of liability is an estimate for expected changes in inflation and health care costs 
if there were to be an excessive number of workers compensation claims in a given accounting period and these actual results varied from the company s assumptions  these could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
income tax valuation during the year  the company records income tax expense and liabilities based on estimates of book and tax income  and current tax rates 
these estimates could vary in the future due to uncertainties in company profits  new laws  new interpretations of existing laws  and rulings by taxing authorities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
the company has recorded a deferred income tax asset for the benefit of federal and state income tax loss carryforwards nol s 
these carryforwards expire in varying amounts between and realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carryforwards 
although realization is not assured  management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
however  the amount realized could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are not achieved 
the company has recorded a deferred income tax asset for the benefit of unused state tax credits  which expire in varying amounts between and realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the state credits 
a valuation allowance in the amount of has been established as management believes that a portion of the state credits may not be realized

in the first half of  the net sales increase was driven by a volume increase  a favorable sales mix and a reduction in product returns 
in the second half of  the increase in net sales due to case volume increases was partially offset by increased promotional spending in both route and non route markets 
non route net sales were up in compared to driven by volume growth of 
non route net sales benefited from incremental promotional programs to support new markets as well as increased focus on existing direct customers

net sales in were relatively unchanged when compared to volume growth of compared to was down by offset by the family pack price increase 
the mid year launch of sensables and expansion into pittsburgh and cleveland increased net sales which were offset by increased returns and promotional spending 
cost of sales cost of sales  as a percentage of gross sales  was   and in   and  respectively 
cost of sales as a percentage of gross sales increased in compared to the increased total cost of sales was in part due to the increase in sales volume and increased sales of higher cost products

cost of sales as a percentage of gross sales decreased in compared to primarily due to sales price increases on the family pack product line and decreased product packaging costs of approximately  this was partially offset by increased ingredient costs and increased pension expense 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded additional pension expense in the amount of  in connection with the company s method of immediately recognizing gains and losses that fall outside the pension corridor and a curtailment charge in connection with the company s decision to freeze benefit accruals effective march  of this expense  was included in cost of sales and was included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
gross margin gross margin after depreciation  as a percentage of net sales  was   and in   and  respectively 
the percentage point improvement resulted from the improved price realization on net sales in the first half of and a reduction in depreciation expense  partially offset by incremental energy and packaging costs in the second half of gross margin increased in compared to due to sales price increases and decreased product packaging costs 
these savings were partially offset by increased product return expense  higher ingredient costs  increased pension expense and the company s decision to increase promotional spending to support the price increase and new product introductions 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  in compared to this increase is attributed to increased investments made in the information technology and sales organizations as well as increased costs of transportation and freight due to higher fuel costs in the second half of a portion of this increase is also attributed to increased performance based compensation expense and increased marketing spending as the company engaged in more billboard advertising and an elevated level of radio advertising campaigns 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in pension and retiree medical expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or  in compared to due the company s decision to decrease marketing spending to compensate for the increase in promotional spending 
this reduction in operating expenses was partially offset by an increase in administrative expense for auditing and consulting fees in conjunction with the company s compliance work for sarbanes oxley section as well as the increase in pension expense 
depreciation depreciation expense in decreased compared to this decrease was driven by the acceleration of depreciation of assets related to the previous erp system replaced in the fourth quarter  partially offset by an increase in depreciation from the new erp system 
depreciation expense in increased compared to this increase is primarily due to the amortization of new handheld equipment placed into service during the second quarter of in march  the company performed a comprehensive review of the estimated useful lives of all asset classes 
as a result  the company evaluated the utilization of certain machinery and equipment and determined that its useful lives should be extended to years from years  consistent with similar assets already being depreciated over years 
the useful lives of buildings and improvements were standardized at years from to years 
also as part of this review  the estimated useful lives for certain machinery  leasehold improvements and the erp system were reduced  and depreciation was accelerated 
the result of this change in estimate was a decrease in depreciation expense of  for also  depreciation expense increased by  in  due to a change in estimated useful lives of certain machinery  leasehold improvements and the current erp system which was replaced in the fourth quarter of when the new erp system was implemented 
management has accounted for these changes as changes in estimates because the facts  circumstances and assumptions surrounding the original determination of the useful lives have changed 
for the erp system  the company s decision to implement a new system by the end of fiscal resulted in a change to the estimated useful life of the replaced erp system 
the changes in the estimated useful lives of the machinery and equipment from years to years relate to the philadelphia  pa bakery modernization that started in all machinery and equipment installed from to was assigned a year life based on the assumption at the time about the quality of the equipment being installed 
starting in fiscal year  management started assigning year lives to the machinery and equipment as it was determined that the quality of the machinery and equipment was better than originally expected at the start of the modernization in in the company s review completed in march  the company determined that the machinery and equipment assigned year lives from to had the same performance characteristics as the machinery and equipment assigned year estimated lives  thereby supporting the change in estimate in the plant modernization begun in also supported the change in estimate for buildings and improvements to years

other income  net  increased in compared to due to a gain on the sale of equipment compared to a loss in the prior year 
interest expense increased by in compared to this is due to increased average interest rates and average borrowing levels 
interest expense in increased by compared to  primarily due to rate increases from a change in credit spreads on certain credit facilities 
the company is exposed to market risk relative to its interest expense as its long term debt interest rates may vary with conditions in the credit markets 
it is expected that a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in additional annual expense of approximately on august   in order to hedge a portion of the company s exposure to changes in interest rates the company entered into a five year million interest rate swap with a fixed libor rate of 
the company also entered into two five year interest rate swaps for its term loans for and million on september and december  with fixed libor rates of and respectively

liquidity and capital resources current assets at december  were  compared to  at december   and current liabilities at december   were  compared to  at december  current assets were relatively flat as the increases in inventory and prepaid assets were offset by a decrease in accounts receivable due to improved cash collections 
the decrease in the accounts receivable allowance was driven by the write off of accounts receivable balances that were fully reserved in the allowance in the decrease in current liabilities in was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts payable and the amended credit agreement which revised the maturity of approximately million of notes payable and the current portion of long term debt  moving it to long term debt 
on the consolidated balance sheet as of december    is classified as long term debt 
long term debt of  was outstanding at december  the increase in long term debt in the amount of  is due to the elimination of the short term portion of the credit facility along with the additional mortgage loan and the term loans

net cash from operating activities in decreased by  compared to the decrease primarily resulted from a pension contribution of  made in september of and an increase in cash pension expense of approximately  due primarily to the conversion from the defined benefit pension plan to the defined contribution pension plan 
the decrease is also attributed to a net reduction in cash of approximately  from a decrease in accounts payable 
net cash from operating activities in increased by  compared to the increase primarily resulted from an increase in net income when compared to the net loss in and a decrease in restructure payments 
partially offsetting these favorable changes were net unfavorable changes in assets and liabilities including an increase in receivables compared to a decrease in the prior year and a smaller increase in accounts payable as presented in the consolidated balance sheet partially offset by a decrease in prepayments from the collection of a federal income tax refund

r  share based payment fas r  which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
in april  the sec approved a new rule that makes fas r effective for annual periods that begin after june  the company adopted fas r in january  and selected the modified prospective application mpa  without restatement of prior interim periods in the year of adoption 
see note regarding the company s election to accelerate the vesting of all outstanding  unvested stock options 
in march  the fasb issued final guidance that clarifies how companies should account for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  deals with obligations to perform asset retirement activities in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event eg  legal requirements surrounding asbestos handling and disposals that are triggered by demolishing or renovating a facility 
the new guidance required companies to recognize liabilities for these obligations  effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  december   for calendar year enterprises 
retrospective application for interim financial information is permitted but is not required 
in implementing the new guidance  a company will need to identify its conditional asset retirement obligations and determine whether it can reasonably estimate the fair value of each obligation 
if the company can reasonably estimate the fair value of an obligation  it will need to recognize a liability for that obligation 
in accordance with fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  the company must recognize liabilities for obligations related to asset retirement activities in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event when it can reasonably estimate the fair value of each conditional asset retirement obligation 
in december  the company purchased from its pension plan the philadelphia production facility  which contains asbestos 
the company is not under any current obligation to remove the asbestos since it is encased and in compliance with current regulatory codes 
the company may have an obligation to remove the asbestos if the facility were to undergo a major renovation or to be demolished 
the company has no current plans to demolish or perform any major renovations 
the company cannot recognize a liability for the potential removal of asbestos because it cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation 
the fair value cannot be determined because the company has not made any decision to retire the facility  but in the future  it would have options including selling  demolishing or abandonment 
the company does not have sufficient information because the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates is not estimable at this time and therefore sufficient information is not available to apply an expected present value technique 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company has certain floating rate debt notes 
the company has hedged a portion of this risk by entering into interest rate swap contracts which fixed the interest rate for the term of the debt 
under current market conditions  the company believes that changes in interest rates would not have a material impact on the financial statements of the company 
it is expected that a one percentage point increase in interest rates for the unhedged portion would result in additional annual expense of approximately thousand 
the company also has notes receivable from sales distributors whose rates adjust every three years  and  therefore  would partially offset the fluctuations in the company s interest rates on its notes payable 
the company also has the right to sell these notes receivable  and could use these proceeds to liquidate a corresponding amount of the debt on the notes payable 
information on the debt  including interest rate swap and receivable notes can be found in the notes to consolidated financial statements  notes and  respectively
