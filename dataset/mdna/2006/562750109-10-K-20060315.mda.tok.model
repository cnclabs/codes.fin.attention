application of critical accounting policies and estimates the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 

table of contents the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made estimates and judgments relating to certain amounts included in the financial statements 
as a result  application of these accounting policies  could cause actual results to differ from these estimates 
we have identified the following as our critical accounting policies revenues and revenue recognition our revenue is derived from i software and hosting fees  which consist of revenue from the licensing and hosting of software and revenue from funded research and development efforts  ii services revenue  which consist of fees from consulting  implementation and training services collectively  professional services  plus customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions  and iii hardware and other revenue  which consists of sales of hardware and reimbursed project expenses 
revenue recognition rules for software companies are very complex 
we recognize software fees in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
although we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  the application of those guidelines requires judgment including i whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements  ii whether customizations or modifications of the software are significant  and iii whether collection of the software fee is probable 
additionally  we specifically evaluate any other terms in our license transactions  including but not limited to  options to purchase additional software at a future date  extended payment terms  functionality commitments not delivered with the software and existing outstanding receivable balances in making the determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognition 
most of our software arrangements include professional services 
professional services revenues are generally accounted for separately from the software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined by sop the most significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of the services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors and timing of payments 
we provide our professional services under services agreements on a time and material basis or based on a fixed price and or fixed time arrangement 
the revenues from our time and material based professional consulting and implementation services are recognized as the work is performed  provided that the customer has a contractual obligation to pay  the fee is non refundable and collection is probable 
delays in project implementation will result in delays in revenue recognition 
for our professional consulting services under fixed price and or fixed time arrangements  we recognize the related revenues on a proportional performance basis  with progress to completion measured by using labor costs input compared to estimated cost of completion 
revisions to the estimates are reflected in the period in which changes become known 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or if we do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time  then future consulting margins on our projects may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
hardware revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products  developed and manufactured by third parties  which are integrated with and complementary to our software solutions 
these products include computer equipment  radio frequency terminal networks  rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners and other peripherals 
we generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer  and revenue is recognized upon shipment by the vendor to the customer 
accounts receivable we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts generally represent a sales allowance on services 
table of contents revenue  which are recorded to operations as a reduction to services revenue 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our top five customers in aggregate accounted for  and of total revenue for each of the years ended december    and  respectively 
no single customer accounted for more than of revenue in  or during  we recorded a million bad debt provision for the entire amount of the accounts receivable due from a large german customer with which we have had a challenging relationship and for which we consider collection to be doubtful 
the million bad debt provision is our best estimate of costs to be incurred from the termination of our business relationship with the large challenging customer 
however  this amount may change if the issue results in litigation or if a settlement is reached that is not covered by our corporate insurance policies 
it is not possible at this time to estimate the amount of any such potential costs 
on january   a significant customer from filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as a result of the filing  the uncertainties around the bankruptcy proceedings and the ultimate timing of payment  we recorded an allowance of million in to effectively defer revenues arising in the fourth quarter of from the significant customer  but unpaid at the time of the bankruptcy declaration 
we recorded a recovery of approximately million of the receivable in the fourth quarter of upon receiving the final cash settlement in june  subsequent to the significant customer emerging from bankruptcy  we recovered an additional  of the receivable during the second quarter of the recoveries were recorded as separate revenue line items in the consolidated statements of income and reductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts in the consolidated balance sheets during the respective quarters 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
our long lived and intangible assets and goodwill are subject to annual impairment tests  which require us to estimate the fair value of our business compared to the carrying value 
the impairment reviews require an analysis of future projections and assumptions about our operating performance 
should such review indicate the assets are impaired  we would record an expense for the impaired assets 
annual tests or other future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill is impaired 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill and intangible assets had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to take a charge to income for that portion of goodwill or intangible assets that we believed was impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
at december   our goodwill balance was million and our intangible assets with definite lives balance was million  net of accumulated amortization 
income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this accounting pronouncement  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events that are recorded for financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return 
management must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  allowable deductions  projected tax credits and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current 
table of contents assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
acquisition on august   we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of evant  inc evant  and evant became a wholly owned subsidiary 
evant is a provider of demand planning and forecasting and replenishment solutions to more than customers in the retail  manufacturing and distribution industries 
the acquisition further diversifies our product suite and expands our customer base 
we paid an aggregate of million in cash  and incurred million in acquisition costs and million of severance to eliminate duplicative functions 
the million includes million of bonuses paid to employees not retained by us pursuant to an employee bonus plan approved by evant s management the evant bonus plan 
in addition to the million cash paid  we paid million into escrow at closing for employee retention purposes pursuant to the evant bonus plan 
these funds are being distributed to employees upon completion of up to months of service with us 
the million has been recorded as a prepaid asset  and we are recording compensation expense ratably over the required employee retention period 
as of december   the prepaid asset balance was million relating to the bonuses 
of the cash paid  million is being held in escrow for months to reimburse us  subject to certain limitations  for potential losses resulting from  among other things  breaches of representations  warranties or covenants in the merger agreement and certain pending and potential claims and other matters specified in the merger agreement  million is being held in escrow for six months to satisfy a potential customer obligation  and million is being held in escrow for dissenting shareholders as of december  until certain shareholder issues are resolved 
the acquisition of evant was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the operating results of evant are included in our operations beginning september  results of operations overview over the past several years  our primary goal has been and continues to be to expand our position as a leading provider of technology based supply chain solutions that help companies manage the effectiveness and efficiency of their supply chain by delivering integrated  modular solutions to our customers 
with the addition and integration of new products resulting from the acquisitions completed during the last three years  along with releases of new versions of our product suite with enhanced functionality  we have been able to accomplish continued revenue growth 
during  we were able to expand our target market to include supply chain planning as a result of the acquisition of evant 
during  we continued to experience the effects of a weak spending environment for information technology in europe  in the form of delayed and cancelled buying decisions by customers for our software  services and hardware  deferrals by customers of service engagements previously scheduled and pressure by our customers and competitors to discount our offerings 
we believe that a deterioration in the current business climates within the united states and or other geographic regions in which we operate or continued delay in capital spending could have a material adverse impact on our future operations 
in  we plan to continue to enhance both our supply chain planning and supply chain execution solutions  expand globally and further develop our sales and marketing  including strategic alliances and indirect sales channels 
our success could be limited by several factors  including spending on information technology  the timely release of quality new products and releases  continued market acceptance of our solutions and the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors 

table of contents revenue year ended year ended year ended december  change december  change december  to to software and hosting fees percentage of total revenues services percentage of total revenues hardware and other percentage of total revenues recovery relating to bankrupt customer total revenue percentage is not meaningful our revenue consists of fees generated from the licensing and hosting of software  fees from professional services  customer support services and software enhancement subscriptions  and sales of complementary radio frequency and computer equipment 
we believe our revenue growth in the last two years is attributable to several factors  including  among others  the acquisition of evant which provided us with a strong supply chain planning solution  increased sales of our expanded supply chain execution product suite  geographic expansion  our market leadership positions as to breadth of product offerings and financial stability and a compelling return on investment proposition for our customers 
software and hosting fees 
the increase in software and hosting fees from to was attributable to an increase of million  or  in sales of our warehouse management solution group and an increase of million  or  for all other solution groups 
the increase in software and hosting fees from to was due to an increase of million  or  in sales of our warehouse management solution group and sales of approximately million of our new demand forecasting and replenishment solutions obtained as part of the evant acquisition  which was closed in the third quarter of from period to period  we continue to see an increase in the diversity of products purchased from us by new and existing customers as our newer products gain greater market acceptance 
this is contributing to the fluctuations in the sales mix of our solutions groups 
also impacting the changes from to and to was the sales by operating segment 
americas sales increased by million  or  from to  while sales outside americas increased by million  or  from to the increase outside of americas was primarily in asia pacific  which increased by million 
americas sales increased by million  or  from to  while sales outside americas decreased by million  or  from to the decrease outside americas was from decreased sales in europe  which decreased by million  or  from to services revenue 
the increases in services revenue from to and from to were principally due to i increases of and in and  respectively  in the number of active engagements required to implement the increased amount of software sold and to upgrade existing customers to more current versions of our offerings  and ii renewals of customer support services and software enhancement subscription agreements on a growing installed base 
revenue from software enhancement subscription agreements increased by and during and  respectively 
included in the increase from to was approximately million of additional revenue resulting from the addition of evant in over the past several years  we have experienced some pricing pressures with regard to our services 
we believe that the pricing pressures are attributable to global macro economic conditions and competitive pressures 
our services revenue growth has been and will likely continue to be affected by the mix of products sold 
the individual engagements involving our newer products  including tms  rfid and tpm  typically require less implementation services  however  the number of engagements continues to grow 
hardware and other 
sales of hardware are non strategic and largely dependent upon customer specific desires 
sales of hardware decreased million  or  from approximately million in to 
table of contents approximately million in and decreased an additional million  or  to approximately million in the decreases in hardware sales from to and from to are attributable to customers desires in the current macro economic environment to buy hardware from other suppliers offering greater discounts 
as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  reimbursements for out of pocket expenses are required to be classified as revenue and are included in hardware and other revenue 
for  and  reimbursements by customers for out of pocket expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
recovery relating to bankrupt customer 
on january   a significant customer for filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
as a result of the filing  the uncertainties around the bankruptcy proceedings and the ultimate timing of payment  we recorded an allowance of million in to effectively defer revenues arising in the fourth quarter of from the significant customer  but unpaid at the time of the bankruptcy declaration 
we recorded a recovery of approximately million of the receivable in the fourth quarter of upon receiving the final cash settlement in june  subsequent to the significant customer emerging from bankruptcy  we recovered an additional  of the receivable during the second quarter of the recoveries were recorded as separate revenue line items in the consolidated statements of income and reductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts in the consolidated balance sheets during the respective quarters 
geographic regions 
we manage our business based on geographic regions 
our operating segments are the americas  europe  middle east and africa emea  and asia pacific 
geographic revenue information is based on the location of sale 
during  and  we derived the majority of our revenues from sales to customers within our americas region 
revenues by region represented the following percentages of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  americas emea asia pacific the relative revenue decrease in emea during was the result of delayed commitments for capital investments in supply chain solutions  lower revenues resulting from the termination of our business relationship with a large customer in germany  and the overall weakness of the european economy 
we have realized increases in revenues from to and from to in asia pacific as a result of the additional investments made in australia  china and japan 
incremental revenues in asia pacific are primarily the result of increased revenues in australia from a large retail customer 
additional financial data for each operating segment can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements

cost of services consists primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses of employees dedicated to professional and technical services and customer support services 
the increases in cost of services from to and from to were principally due to increases in salary related costs resulting from i increases of during both and in the number of personnel dedicated to the delivery of professional and technical services to support the increase in services revenue  and ii annual compensation increases 
the increase in headcount during excluding india services personnel was approximately  while the india technical and customer services headcount nearly doubled to at december  during  we incurred approximately million in higher bonus expense as we achieved better financial results relative to internal plans and also higher contract labor of approximately million  relating primarily to one project that had a high demand for resources during the summer months 
the decrease in the services gross margin from in to during was attributable to the shift in product mix to open systems  fixed price contracts  including unusually high costs associated with the implementation for one particularly challenging customer  and increased costs due to international expansion and training 
the implementation of our warehouse management open 
table of contents systems products is more costly than the implementation of our legacy warehouse management product  the iseries or as  due to the lower maturity level of the product and limited experience of the services personnel and integration requirements with multiple third party hardware and software products

lema delivers database independence  a common data model  single sign on functionality and an event driven  long running transaction processing environment 
computer software development costs are charged to research and development expense until technological feasibility is established  after which remaining software production costs are capitalized 
we have defined technological feasibility as the point in time at which we have a detailed program design or a working model of the related product  depending upon the type of development effort 
for the years ended december   and  we capitalized no research and development costs because the costs between the attainment of technological feasibility for the related software product through the date of general release were insignificant 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions  travel and other personnel related costs of sales and marketing personnel and the costs of our marketing and alliance programs and related activities 
the increases in sales and marketing expenses from to and from to are principally attributable to i greater incentive compensation paid on and higher license and hosting fees in over and over  and ii continued global expansion of our sales and marketing programs

our effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate takes into account the source of taxable income  domestically by state and internationally by country  and available income tax credits 
the increase in the tax rate in was attributable to the inability to recognize significant tax benefit from the accounts receivable and restructuring charges described above due to the recent losses in the foreign locations where most of these charges occurred  in addition to operating losses in certain foreign locations  including germany  the netherlands  japan and china  where the expectation of realizing the tax benefit of those losses is not yet probable

we believe that our existing liquidity and expected cash flows from operations will satisfy our capital requirements for normal operations for the foreseeable future 
we believe that existing balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs at least for the next twelve months  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case
