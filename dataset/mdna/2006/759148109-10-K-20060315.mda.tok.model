item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview prior to acquiring the assets of meadowbrook  we operated in two business segments that were managed separately based on fundamental differences in operations program management services and healthcare management consulting 
program management includes hospital rehabilitation services including inpatient acute rehabilitation and skilled nursing units and outpatient therapy programs and contract therapy programs 
on august   with the acquisition of the meadowbrook assets  we added a new segment freestanding hospitals 
the new segment currently operates three freestanding acute rehabilitation hospitals located in florida and texas and two long term acute care hospitals ltachs located in oklahoma and louisiana 
we also previously operated a healthcare staffing segment prior to selling that business on february  year ended december  in thousands revenues program management contract therapy hospital rehabilitation services program management total freestanding hospitals healthcare management consulting healthcare staffing less intercompany revenues total operating earnings loss 

program management contract therapy hospital rehabilitation services program management total freestanding hospitals healthcare management consulting healthcare staffing unallocated corporate selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charge total represents operating revenues and operating profits generated by the freestanding hospital segment which was formed on august  with acquisition of substantially all of the operating assets of meadowbrook healthcare 
intercompany revenues represent sales of services  at market rates  between our operating divisions 
the operating earnings of hospital rehabilitation services contain a million impairment loss on certain separately identifiable intangible assets 
the operating loss for healthcare staffing contains a  gain realized on the sale of the business on february  the operating loss for healthcare staffing contains a million loss to state net assets and liabilities held for sale at their fair value less estimated costs to sell 
represents certain expenses associated with the indemnification of pre sale liabilities  related to our former starmed staffing business  in excess of the amount accrued upon the sale of the business on february  sources of revenue in our program management segment  we derive substantially all of our revenues from fees paid directly by healthcare providers rather than through payment or reimbursement by government or other third party payors 
our inpatient and outpatient therapy programs are typically provided through agreements with hospital clients with three to five year terms 
our contract therapy services are typically provided under one to two year agreements primarily with hospitals and skilled nursing facilities 
in our freestanding hospital segment we derive substantially all of our revenues from fees for patient care services  which are usually paid for or reimbursed by medicare and medicaid or third party managed care programs

contract therapy revenues grew significantly in as compared to a portion of this revenue increase  million  is attributable to the acquisitions of cpr therapies in february and cornerstone rehabilitation in december in addition to the revenues from the acquisitions  continued success of the division s sales efforts and same store revenue growth of were driving forces behind the overall revenue growth 
however  much of the same store growth was attributable to overall increases in medicare part a patient services  which generate lower than average profit margins 
the average revenue per location increased year over year due primarily to the same store growth mentioned above  which was partially offset by the smaller average size of the program locations purchased in the acquisitions mentioned above 
hospital rehabilitation services 
hospital rehabilitation services operating revenues declined by million or in as a million decline in inpatient revenues was only partially offset by a million increase in outpatient revenues 
overall inpatient same store discharges fell  primarily due to the continued implementation of the rule 
inpatient same store revenues fell  as pricing pressures compounded the impact of the rule 
the average number of inpatient units managed in increased from fiscal year  however  new openings did not generate sufficient revenue to offset the impact of closing larger mature facilities 
in particular  revenue from units associated with the march  acquisition of vitalcare fell million in  primarily due to a significant number of contract terminations 
the average number of outpatient units managed in increased from higher revenues per unit of service offset a decline in the number of outpatient same store visits 
average outpatient revenue per location grew as units opened since the middle of have been generally larger than units closed over the same time period 
freestanding hospitals 
freestanding hospital revenues were million in our acquisition of the assets of meadowbrook was completed on august   therefore  only five months of meadowbrook s operating revenues are included in our financial statements for revenues for the period were negatively impacted by lower than expected patient census as efforts to reestablish referral networks and renegotiate key managed care contracts after the acquisition took longer than anticipated 
cost and expenses of of revenue revenue dollars in thousands consolidated costs and expenses operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative impairment of intangible assets restructuring charge depreciation and amortization gain on sale of business total costs and expenses in  certain expenses associated with the indemnification of pre sale liabilities related to our former starmed staffing business  in excess of the amount accrued upon the sale of the business on february   have not been allocated against our current business segments operating profits 
see the following table for detail of costs and expenses by business segment 
operating expenses increased as a percentage of revenues due to increased operating costs in contract therapy and hospital rehabilitation services as discussed in more detail below and due to the overall shift in mix to more contract therapy business  which tends to have lower operating margins 
the decrease in division selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues resulted primarily from the contract therapy division s higher revenues  which helped to leverage the division s overhead costs 
corporate selling  general and administrative costs declined as a percentage of revenues primarily due to efforts to control costs combined with a decrease in management incentive costs 
in connection with the sale of our starmed healthcare staffing business in february  we initiated a series of restructuring activities to reduce the cost of corporate overhead that had previously been absorbed by the staffing division 
these activities included the elimination of approximately positions  exiting a portion of leased office space at our corporate headquarters  and the write off of certain abandoned leasehold improvements associated with the office space consolidation 
in addition  we modified the term of the stock options of certain starmed employees to allow them additional time to exercise vested options 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million in of of unit unit revenue revenue dollars in thousands contract therapy operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses hospital rehabilitation services operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative impairment of intangible assets depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses freestanding hospitals operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses healthcare staffing operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative gain on assets held for sale total costs and expenses healthcare management consulting operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses contract therapy 
total contract therapy costs and expenses increased in compared to primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses associated with the increased number of contract therapy locations being managed by the division 
in addition  the division s direct operating expenses increased as a percentage of unit revenue from to primarily as a result of an increase in the division s mix of lower margin medicare part a revenues  substantial increases in contract therapy s cost of direct labor  which is being fueled by the continued tight therapist labor market  and the impact of communication and data costs 
these increased direct operating costs were partially offset by therapist productivity improvements as well as a reduction in contract therapy s bad debt expense  resulting from the positive outcomes of settlements reached on a few specific accounts 
accordingly  the overall risk in the division s accounts receivable portfolio has declined in contract therapy continues to leverage its selling  general and administrative costs  which decreased as a percentage of revenues from to while the cornerstone rehabilitation acquisition added new general and administrative fixed costs associated with its corporate office and related staff in louisiana  contract therapy s management has been able to keep its selling costs flat as well as continue leveraging its management structure  allowing them to operate more programs per manager  which has helped to reduce associated travel costs 
while remaining relatively flat as a percentage of operating revenues  contract therapy s depreciation and amortization expense increased from to primarily due to the amortization of certain intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of cpr therapies and cornerstone and the amortization of the division s proprietary information system 
the strong revenue growth and cost control at the corporate and division selling  general and administrative levels helped increase operating earnings from million in to million in hospital rehabilitation services 
total hospital rehabilitation services costs and expenses increased from the prior year both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of revenue primarily due to an impairment loss associated with trade name and contractual customer relationships intangible assets acquired as part of the march acquisition of vitalcare and higher labor costs 
both the inpatient and outpatient businesses experienced increases in average wage rates and contract labor expense as the market for therapists remained tight 
the increase in the ratio of direct operating expenses to segment revenue reflects the higher labor costs and the termination of a number of higher margin contracts associated with the march  acquisition of vitalcare 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenues increased slightly as a result of an increase in depreciation due to outpatient expansion and a full year of amortization associated with the vitalcare acquisition 
the net effect of revenue decline  lower operating margins  the impairment charge and the increased depreciation and amortization during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was a million decline in hospital rehabilitation services operating earnings from million to million 
as discussed above  since acquiring the stock of vitalcare in march  we have experienced losses of subacute facility contracts at a faster rate than expected 
this trend continued during the fourth quarter of  and despite continued reductions in overhead costs  operating losses were incurred for this business 
these events led us to assess whether the goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets associated with the vitalcare acquisition were impaired 
our conclusion  after performing all of the applicable impairment calculations and analyses  was that the vitalcare trade name and contractual customer relationship intangible assets were impaired 
as a result  we recorded a pretax impairment charge of million  reducing the combined net book value of those assets to approximately million as of december  freestanding hospitals 
the freestanding hospitals segment incurred an operating loss of million for the period from august  to december  primarily due to the impact of the lower than expected patient census  significant market analysis and promotional costs and start up costs associated with two new freestanding rehabilitation hospitals 
we incurred start up costs of million related to our arlington  texas facility which admitted its first patient in late december and another million for our amarillo  texas facility which is under construction 
we anticipate that the amarillo facility will open on july  assuming there are no delays with the construction process 
we are still in the process of integrating the newly acquired meadowbrook business and implementing new program development and expense control initiatives 
non operating items interest income increased from million in to million in  primarily due to the effect of higher interest rates 
interest expense  which remained flat from to  primarily includes interest on subordinated promissory notes issued as partial consideration for the meadowbrook acquisition in august and various other acquisitions completed in  commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit and fees paid on outstanding letters of credit 
we had no outstanding balance against our line of credit as of december  and december  earnings before income taxes and equity in net loss of affiliates decreased from million in to million in the provision for income taxes was million in compared to million in  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the effective tax rate decrease is primarily the result of the impact of non deductible goodwill associated with the sale of the staffing division on the effective rate 
equity in net loss of affiliates represents our share of the losses of less than majority owned equity investments  primarily our investment in intelistaf holdings 
during  our share of intelistaf losses was million 
intelistaf s results were negatively impacted by a million pre tax goodwill impairment charge  a million third quarter valuation allowance against their deferred tax assets  a continuing decline in revenue  margin contraction in the travel business due to higher housing and other living costs  and costs related to an operational restructuring and a debt re financing completed during equity in net loss of affiliates for also includes a million write down in the carrying value of our investment in intelistaf to reflect an other than temporary decline in the value of the investment 
diluted earnings loss per share was in compared to in twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  revenues change dollars in thousands contract therapy hospital rehabilitation services healthcare staffing healthcare management consulting n a less intercompany revenues consolidated revenues the decline in consolidated operating revenues from to is primarily attributable to the sale of the healthcare staffing division which was consummated on february  revenues for each of the other operating segments increased from to as further discussed below 
contract therapy 
the increase in contract therapy revenues is due to both strong business development efforts and to the million of additional revenue attributable to the acquisitions of cpr therapies in february and cornerstone rehabilitation in december the average number of contract therapy locations  including those acquired during  managed by the division during the period increased from in the twelve months ended december  to in the twelve months ended december  the average revenue per location increased year over year from  to  this increase was the result of strong growth in the division s same store revenues for the periods being compared  however  some of this growth was offset by the termination of several large  mature programs in the second quarter of and the smaller average size of the sixty cpr therapies facilities purchased in february and fifty cornerstone rehabilitation facilities purchased in december hospital rehabilitation services 
the march  acquisition of vitalcare contributed million of revenue in this increase and an increase in average revenue per location were offset by a decline in the average number of units  excluding those added by the vitalcare acquisition  operated during the average number of outpatient units managed in fiscal year declined from fiscal year this decline was the result of closures of certain smaller  less profitable units and from greater competition from physician practices 
the average revenue per location in the outpatient business increased year over year to million in overall  the average number of hospital rehabilitation services locations managed by the division increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the average revenue per unit in the inpatient business remained flat at million per location 
a increase in same store discharges was offset by lower revenues per unit at the vitalcare units acquired in and at facilities opened during the year due to typical new unit ramp up 
cost and expenses of of revenue revenue dollars in thousands consolidated costs and expenses operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative restructuring charge loss on assets held for sale depreciation and amortization gain on sale of business total costs and expenses the ratios of operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were significantly affected by the sale of our healthcare staffing division 
historically  the healthcare staffing division s operating and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of division revenues were higher than our other divisions 
as a result  with the divestiture of that division  we experienced improvements in those ratios on a year over year basis 
however  despite a million or reduction in corporate selling  general and administrative expenses  the consolidated ratio of corporate selling  general and administrative expenses to revenue deteriorated as corporate overheads were allocated over the remaining operating units 
total depreciation and amortization expense was flat year over year as lower depreciation and amortization resulting from the divestiture of the healthcare staffing division was offset by increased amortization on intangible assets relating to the acquisitions of cpr  vitalcare and cornerstone and the write off of a software license that we no longer have plans to use 
the gain on sale of business and loss on assets held for sale both pertain to the sale of the healthcare staffing division 
in  the net assets of that division were written down to their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
when the division was sold in  a gain was recognized representing the net impact of changes in the underlying asset and liability values and adjustments to the estimated costs to sell 
in july  we announced a comprehensive multifaceted restructuring program to return us to growth and improved profitability 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we recognized a pre tax restructuring expense of million for severance  outplacement and exit costs 
in connection with the sale of our healthcare staffing division in february  we initiated a series of restructuring activities to reduce the cost of corporate overhead that had previously been absorbed by the staffing division 
these activities included the elimination of approximately positions  exiting a portion of leased office space at our corporate headquarters and the write off of certain abandoned leasehold improvements associated with the office space consolidation 
in addition  we modified the term of the stock options of certain starmed employees to allow them additional time to exercise vested options 
as a result of these actions  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of approximately million 
of of unit unit revenue revenue dollars in thousands contract therapy operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses hospital rehabilitation services operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses healthcare staffing operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization loss on assets held for sale gain on assets held for sale total costs and expenses healthcare management consulting operating expenses division selling  general and administrative corporate selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total costs and expenses contract therapy 
total contract therapy costs and expenses increased in the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  primarily due to the increase in direct operating expenses resulting from the increased number of contract therapy locations being managed by the division 
as a percentage of net revenues  the division s direct operating expenses decreased year over year 
part of this improvement was due to the moratorium put on the medicare part b caps in december in addition to the benefit from the moratorium  the division also saw reductions in wages and wage related expenses  as a percentage of revenues  through improvements in therapist productivity and reduced benefit costs 
offsetting a portion of these improvements was an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts in to mitigate some of the risk associated with a few specific accounts in our receivables portfolio 
contract therapy also leveraged its division selling  general and administrative costs  which decreased as a percentage of revenues from to much of the division s growth has occurred in markets where there were existing programs  making it easier to manage more programs per manager  thereby increasing selling  general and administrative wages at a rate considerably less than the rate revenues increased 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenues increased year over year due to the amortization of the division s proprietary information system implemented in the second half of  and the amortization related to certain intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of cpr and cornerstone 
the net effect of the revenue growth  overall cost control improvements at the divisional level and the absorption of additional corporate overhead during the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  was a million increase in contract therapy s operating earnings from million to million 
hospital rehabilitation services 
the improvement in the ratio of direct operating expenses to division revenue was primarily due to lower direct operating expenses at the vitalcare units and an increase in management only contracts versus full staffing agreements  partially offset by an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal year as a result of our normal assessment of payment risk 
division selling  general  and administrative costs increased as a percentage of revenue as savings resulting from the consolidation of inpatient and outpatient overhead activities were offset by higher general and administrative expenses associated with vitalcare operations 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenues declined slightly as a result of a decline in the allocation of software amortization to the division  partially offset by an increase in amortization of certain intangible assets associated with the acquisition of vitalcare 
the net effect of revenue growth  overall cost control improvements at the divisional level  and the absorption of additional corporate overhead during the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  was a million decline in hospital rehabilitation service s operating earnings from million to million 
non operating items interest income increased by million from million in to million in  primarily due to higher average invested balances and some increase in interest rates in the second half of the year 
interest expense in primarily consisted of interest related to subordinated promissory notes issued in connection with the cpr  vitalcare and cornerstone acquisitions  commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our line of credit  letter of credit fees and amortization of deferred loan origination fees 
compared to  interest expense in increased as a result of the issuance of the subordinated promissory notes  higher amounts of letters of credit to support insurance programs and the write off of approximately million of deferred loan origination fees as a result of replacing our line of credit which was scheduled to expire in august we had no outstanding balance against our line of credit as of december  and december  the provision for income taxes in was an expense of million compared to a benefit of million in  reflecting effective income tax rates of and  respectively 
the effective rates for both and were significantly impacted by a component of the loss on the sale of the starmed staffing business related to goodwill  which was not deductible for tax purposes 
diluted earnings per share was in compared to diluted loss per share of in this improvement was principally the result of improved contribution margins during as well as the million after tax impairment charge in related to the net assets held for sale in our former staffing division 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and a current ratio  the amount of current assets divided by current liabilities  of to working capital decreased by million to million as of december  as compared to million as of december  primarily due to a reduction in cash associated with the meadowbrook acquisition in august net accounts receivable were million at december   compared to million at december  the number of days average net revenue in net receivables was and at december  and december   respectively 
operating cash flows constitute our primary source of liquidity and historically have been sufficient to fund working capital  capital expenditures  internal business expansion and debt service requirements 
we expect to meet our future working capital  capital expenditures  internal and external business expansion and debt service requirements from a combination of internal sources and outside financing 
on october   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america  na  na bank national association  harris trust and savings bank  national city bank  comerica bank and suntrust bank  as participating banks in the lending group 
the amended and restated credit agreement is an expandable million  five year revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is expandable to million upon our notice to the lending group  subject to our continued compliance with the terms of the amended and restated credit agreement 
at december  and  we had no balance outstanding against our line of credit 
we have approximately million in letters of credit issued to our insurance carriers as collateral for reimbursement of claims 
the letters of credit reduce the amount we may borrow under the line of credit 
thus  our available credit facility capacity was approximately million as of december  as part of the purchases of the meadowbrook business in and cpr therapies  vitalcare and cornerstone rehabilitation in  we issued long term subordinated promissory notes to the respective selling parties 
these notes bear interest at rates ranging from 
approximately million of these notes remained outstanding at december  in addition  as part of our arrangement with signature healthcare foundation  we extended a million line of credit to signature 
at december   signature had drawn approximately million against this line of credit 
in connection with the development and implementation of additional programs  including developing joint venture relationships  we may incur capital expenditures for acquisitions of property  renovations  equipment and deferred costs to begin operations 
in addition  we expect to invest significantly in our information technology systems to drive automation and efficiencies in our operating processes 
during  we expended approximately million for investments in joint ventures and capital expenditures for equipment  facility build outs and information systems 
we also expect to expend capital to implement our acquisition strategy 
during  we expended approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired  for the acquisition of new businesses 
these funds were primarily derived from cash generated from operations 
we believe existing cash balances  internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
inflation although inflation has abated during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services continued to exceed the rate experienced by the economy as a whole 
our management contracts typically provide for an annual increase in the fees paid to us by our clients based on increases in various inflation indices 
effect of recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board enacted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment statement r which replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
statement r requires the measurement of all share based payments to employees using a fair value based method and the recognition of such fair value as expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 
adoption of the standard for our company is required on january   and we plan to utilize the modified prospective method of adoption 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior years  the impact of that adoption would have approximated the pro forma impact of statement as described in note to the company s financial statements 
on december   our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain unvested stock options with exercise prices greater than the closing price of the company s stock on december  of 
as a result of the acceleration  options to purchase approximately  shares became immediately exercisable 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of certain outstanding underwater options was made to reduce compensation expense that otherwise would be recorded in future periods following the company s adoption of sfas r on january  in addition  the board believes this action further enhances management s focus on increasing shareholder returns and will increase employee morale and retention 
the company estimates that the acceleration of the vesting of these underwater stock options will reduce the amounts of share based compensation expense to be recognized  net of income taxes  by approximately  in   in and  in commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our scheduled contractual commitments  exclusive of interest  as of december  in thousands less than more than total year years years years other operating leases purchase obligations long term debt other long term liabilities total purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
approximately million of the amounts included in this line represent commitments related to the construction of our freestanding rehabilitation hospital facility in amarillo  texas 
we maintain a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain employees 
under the plan  participants may defer up to of their salary and cash incentive compensation 
the amounts are held in trust in designated investments and remain our property until distribution 
because most distributions of funds are tied to the termination of employment or retirement of participants  we are not able to predict the timing of payments against this obligation 
at december   we owned trust assets with a value approximately equal to the total amount of this obligation 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed and will continue to discuss its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  estimating contractual allowances  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets and establishing accruals for known and incurred but not reported health  workers compensation and professional liability claims 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances 
we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectability of specific accounts  historical experience and the aging of the accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze customers with historical poor payment history and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance as of december  was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and make adjustments in the periods any excess or shortfall is identified 
contractual allowances 
with the acquisition of the assets of meadowbrook in august  our critical accounting policies now also include the recognition of contractual allowances associated with patient revenues 
we recognize net patient revenues in the reporting period in which the services are performed based on our current billing rates  less actual adjustments and estimated discounts for contractual allowances 
these allowances are principally required for patients covered by medicare  medicaid  managed care health plans and other third party payors 
laws governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
in estimating the discounts for contractual allowances  we reduce our gross patient receivables to the estimated amount that will be recovered for the service rendered based upon previously agreed to rates with the payor 
these estimates are regularly reviewed for accuracy by taking into consideration known changes to contract terms  laws and regulations and payment history 
if such information indicates that our allowances are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional allowances as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination 
we believe our estimation and review process enables us to identify instances on a timely basis where such estimates need to be revised 
due to complexities involved in determining the amounts ultimately due from the payor  the amount we receive as reimbursement for healthcare services provided may be different than our estimates  and such differences could be significant 
goodwill and other intangibles 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated first to their identifiable assets  both tangible and intangible  based on estimated fair values 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed  is recorded as goodwill 
under statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
if the impairment test indicates that the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  then an impairment loss should be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in an amount equal to the excess carrying value 
in  we recognized an impairment loss of million to reduce the carrying value of the trade name we acquired in the march  acquisition of the common stock of american vitalcare  inc and its sister company  managed alternative care  inc 
collectively vitalcare 
we also determined that this intangible asset no longer has an indefinite life and will begin amortizing it on a straight line basis over the trade name s remaining estimated useful life 
under statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  an asset group should be tested for recoverability and possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
primarily due to a loss of customer contracts at a rate more rapid than expected  the assets of vitalcare generated operating losses in and our projections demonstrated potential continuing losses associated with this asset group 
as a result  we determined that the carrying amount of the vitalcare asset group at december  was not recoverable because it exceeded the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group 
based on this analysis  we recognized an impairment loss of million on contractual customer relationships  which is equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the vitalcare asset group exceeded its fair value 
in february  we consummated the sale of our healthcare staffing division to intelistaf pursuant to which we received a minority equity interest in intelistaf 
as of december   we held approximately of the outstanding common stock of intelistaf 
in accordance with the requirements of statement no 
 the assets and liabilities of our healthcare staffing operation were reported on our december  consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities held for sale and were measured at their net fair value less estimated costs to sell 
in  we recognized an impairment loss of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill associated with the staffing division and to accrue estimated selling costs 
as required by statement no 
 we also conducted an annual impairment assessment of goodwill related to our hospital rehabilitation services  contract therapy  freestanding hospitals and healthcare management consulting businesses and determined that the related goodwill was not impaired 
the test required comparison of the estimated fair value of these businesses to our book value 
the estimated fair value was based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as economic trends and government regulations  and internal factors such as changes in our forecasts or in our business strategies 
we believe the assumptions used in our impairment analysis are reasonable and appropriate  however  different assumptions and estimates could affect the results of our impairment analysis and in turn result in an impairment charge 
if an impairment loss should occur in the future  it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
at december   unamortized goodwill related to our hospital rehabilitation services  contract therapy  freestanding hospitals and healthcare management consulting businesses was million  million  million and million  respectively 
health  workers compensation  and professional liability insurance accruals 
we maintain an accrual for our health  workers compensation and professional liability claim costs that are partially self insured and are classified in accrued salaries and wages health insurance and accrued expenses workers compensation and professional liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
at december   the combined amount of these accruals was approximately million 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation  and professional liability claims and payments  based on actuarial computations and industry experience and trends 
in analyzing the accruals  we also consider the nature and severity of the claims  analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as current legal  economic and regulatory factors 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate in the period in which we make such a determination 
the ultimate cost of these claims may be greater than or less than the established accruals 
while we believe that the recorded amounts are appropriate  there can be no assurances that changes to management s estimates will not occur due to limitations inherent in the estimation process 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our hospital and healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our hospital and healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
although we are currently not aware of any such pending or threatened litigation that we believe is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us  other than as set forth in item above  if we become aware of such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary 
investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
we account for our minority equity investments in intelistaf holdings  inc and howard regional specialty care  llc using the provisions of apb opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
our investment in intelistaf was initially recorded at its fair value of million and we have since adjusted the carrying amount of the investment for our share of intelistaf s net losses after the date of acquisition 
in accordance with the provisions of apb  we must assess whether factors exist that may indicate a decrease in the value of our investment has occurred that is other than temporary 
during  intelistaf incurred significant operating losses even though the healthcare staffing industry as a whole showed signs of a recovery 
accordingly  we concluded that an assessment was warranted to determine whether an other than temporary loss of value in our investment had occurred 
our assessment was performed concurrently with intelistaf management s assessment of their own goodwill impairment 
in conjunction with that analysis  intelistaf management retained a third party valuation firm to estimate the fair value of intelistaf s business and in turn to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  that existed at the intelistaf level 
their valuation  which was primarily based on discounted cash flows  indicated that the carrying amount of our investment in intelistaf exceeded its fair value by approximately million 
we reviewed qualitative and quantitative evidence  both positive and negative  to assess whether this decline in value was other than temporary
