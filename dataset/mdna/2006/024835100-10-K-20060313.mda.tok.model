item selected financial data the following table sets forth selected financial and operating data on a consolidated historical basis for the company and on a combined historical basis for the predecessor 
results for the year ended december  represent the combined historical data for our predecessor for the period from january  to august  as well as the consolidated results for our company for the period from august  to december  the following data should be read in conjunction with the notes to consolidated and combined financial statements in item and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in item as of and for the year ended december  statements of operations information revenues      income loss from continuing operations     discontinued operations loss income attributable to discontinued operations gain loss from disposition of real estate  net income loss     per share and distribution data income per diluted share income from continuing operations discontinued operations net income cash distributions declared per share unit cash distributions declared   balance sheet data total assets      secured debt      capital lease obligations  stockholders and predecessor owners equity      selected owned property information owned properties units      beds      occupancy as of december  net cash provided by operating activities      net cash used in investing activities      net cash provided by financing activities      funds from operations ffo net income loss     minority interests gain loss from disposition of estate  real estate related depreciation and amortization      funds from operations      represents per share information and cash distributions declared during the period from august  our ipo date through december  information for the years ended december  and reflects our stockholders equity as a result of the ipo while previous years reflect our predecessor owners equity 
as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit  funds from operations or ffo represents income loss before allocation to minority interests computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of loan origination costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we present ffo because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay distributions 
when considering our ffo  we believe it is also a meaningful measure of our performance to make certain adjustments related to our on campus participating properties 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funds from operations in item contained herein 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our company and our business overview we are one of the largest owners  managers and developers of high quality student housing properties in the united states in terms of beds owned and under management 
we are a fully integrated  self managed and self administered equity reit with expertise in the acquisition  design  financing  development  construction management  leasing and management of student housing properties 
property portfolio as of december   our total property portfolio contained student housing properties with approximately  beds and  apartment units  all of which we manage 
these communities contain modern housing units  offer resort style amenities and are supported by a resident assistant system and other student oriented programming 
our property portfolio includes owned off campus properties that are in close proximities to colleges and universities in ten states  two of which are currently under construction 
the net operating income of these student housing communities  which is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance  is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  which drives our rental rates and occupancy levels and is affected by our ability to control operating costs 
our overall operating performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired student housing communities 
we create long term stockholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire student housing communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy and when market conditions are favorable 
additionally  we participate with two university systems in the ownership of four on campus properties under long term ground facility leases  we refer to these properties as our on campus participating properties 
third party development and management services we also provide development and construction management services for student housing properties owned by universities  c foundations and others 
our clients have included some of the nation s most prominent systems of higher education  including the state university of new york system  the university of california system  the university of houston system  the texas a m university system  the texas state university system  the university of georgia system  the university of north carolina system  the purdue university system  the university of colorado system  and the west virginia university system 
we have developed student housing properties for these clients and a majority of the time have been retained to manage these properties following their opening 
since  we have developed and assisted in securing financing for third party student housing properties  including five projects with scheduled completion dates ranging between august and august as of december   we were under contract on six projects that are currently in process and whose fees range from million to million 
as of december   fees of approximately million remained to be earned by us with respect to these projects  which have scheduled completion dates of august through august in addition  as of december   we have been awarded five projects which have not yet commenced construction 
we also provide third party management and leasing services for student housing properties that represent approximately  beds in approximately  units  of which we developed 
our third party management and leasing services are typically provided pursuant to multi year management contracts that have an initial term that ranges from one to five years 
as of december   our total owned and managed portfolio included properties that represented approximately  beds in approximately  units 
we believe that the ownership and operation of student housing communities in close proximity to selected colleges and universities present an attractive long term investment opportunity for our investors 
we intend to continue to execute our strategy of identifying existing differentiated  typically highly amenitized  student housing communities or development opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry which are projected to experience substantial increases in enrollment and or are under serviced in terms of existing on and or off campus student housing 
while fee revenue from our third party development  construction management and property management services allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities  this area has over time become a smaller portion of our operations due to the continued focus on and growth of our owned property portfolio 
nevertheless  we believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify  close  and successfully operate student housing properties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized all available information  including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated and combined financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized 
application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
revenue and cost recognition of third party development and management services costs associated with the pursuit of third party development and management service contracts are expensed as incurred until such time as we have been notified of a contract award or otherwise believe that it is probable a contract will be awarded 
at such time  the reimbursable portion of such costs are recorded as receivables with the remaining portion deferred and expensed in relation to the revenues earned on such contracts 
development revenues are recognized and related costs including the costs of our development personnel involved in the project deferred and expensed using the percentage of completion method as determined by construction costs incurred relative to the total estimated construction costs 
fees received in excess of those recognized are reflected as deferred development and construction revenue  which is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenues recognized in excess of amounts received are included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
incentive fees are recognized when the project is complete and the incentive amount has been confirmed by an independent third party 
third party management fees are generally received and recognized on a monthly basis and are computed as a percentage of property receipts  revenues or a fixed monthly amount  in accordance with the applicable management contract 
incentive management fees are recognized when the contractual criteria are anticipated to be met 
student housing rental revenue recognition and accounts receivable student housing rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned 
in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we analyze the aging of resident receivables  historical bad debts  and current economic trends 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income  as an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reduces our net income 
allocation of fair value to acquired properties the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors  including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  favorable or unfavorable financing  and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes  among other items  determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  in place tenant leases  and any debt assumed from the seller 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
our calculation methodology is summarized in note to our consolidated and combined financial statements contained in item herein 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of in place tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to in place tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases generally less than one year 
long lived assets impairment on a periodic basis  management is required to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
these estimates of cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property  thereby reducing our net income 
construction property savings and fire proceeds an entity formed by our predecessor owners was entitled to any savings in the budgeted completion cost of three of our owned off campus construction properties that were completed in fall in february  our predecessor owners received such funds 
additionally  in april  our predecessor owners received insurance proceeds originally received by the company in connection with the fire that occurred at the university village at fresno in these payments were accounted for as equity distributions 
capital expenditures we distinguish between capital expenditures necessary for the ongoing operations of our properties and acquisition related improvements incurred within one to two years of acquisition of the related property 
acquisition related improvements are expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired  and which we intended to incur in order to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards 
we capitalize non recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements 
in addition  we generally capitalize expenditures for exterior painting  roofing  and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of the existing assets 
the cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance that do not improve the value of an asset or extend its useful life are charged to expense when incurred 
planned major repair  maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed 
in some circumstances  lenders require us to maintain a reserve account for future repairs and capital expenditures 
these amounts are classified as restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as the funds are not available to us for current use 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and december  the following table presents our results of operations for the years ended december  and  including the amount and percentage change in these results between the two periods 
the results for the year ended december  as presented below represent the consolidated financial results of our company for the period from august  to december  and the combined financial results of our predecessor for the period from january  to august  the presentation of results for the year ended december  below is not in accordance with gaap and is presented only for comparison purposes 
year ended december  change change revenues owned off campus properties    on campus participating properties    third party development and management services   resident services  total revenues    operating expenses owned off campus properties    on campus participating properties   third party development and management services    general and administrative    depreciation and amortization    ground facility lease total operating expenses    operating income    nonoperating income and expenses interest income interest expense   amortization of deferred financing costs   other nonoperating income  total nonoperating expenses   income loss before income taxes  minority interests  and discontinued operations    income tax provision benefit minority interests income loss from continuing operations    discontinued operations loss income attributable to discontinued operations gain loss from disposition of real estate    total discontinued operations    net income loss    owned off campus properties operations revenues and operating expenses from our owned off campus properties increased by million and million  respectively  in as compared to these increases were primarily due to the acquisition of seven properties during the first quarter of  the completion of construction and opening of two properties in august  the completion of construction and opening of one property in august  and higher year to date occupancy at a majority of the same store properties operated during both periods  as described below 
university village at san bernardino  which also opened in august of  was sold in january and is therefore not reflected in operating revenues and expenses but is included in discontinued operations 
new property operations 
we acquired seven properties containing  beds at various times during the first quarter of  located in florida gainesville and tallahassee and denton  texas 
we also completed construction of and opened an bed property serving the state university of new york buffalo in august additionally  in august  we completed construction of and opened a bed property serving california state university  fresno and a bed property serving temple university 
these new properties contributed million of additional revenues and million of additional operating expenses in as compared to same store property operations excluding new property activity 
we had nine properties containing  beds which were operating during both and these properties produced revenues of million and million during and  respectively  an increase of million 
excluding resident services revenues  which are provided through our trs subsequent to our ipo  these properties produced revenues of million during  as compared to million in  an increase of million 
these increases were due primarily to the improved lease up for the academic year  which resulted in average occupancy rates increasing to in from in revenues in will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the academic year at our various properties during our leasing period  which typically begins in january and ends in august 
at these existing properties  operating expenses remained relatively constant at million for both and we anticipate that operating expenses in will increase slightly as compared with as a result of expected increases in utility costs  property taxes and general inflation 
on campus participating properties ocpp operations new property operations 
in august  we completed construction of and opened an additional phase of our cullen oaks property  consisting of units and beds 
this additional phase contributed approximately million of additional revenues and approximately million of additional operating expenses during same store ocpp operations 
we had four participating properties containing  beds which were operating during both and revenues from our same store on campus participating properties increased to million in from million in  an increase of million 
this increase was due to increased rental rates  which were offset by a decrease in average occupancy from in to in  as well as an increase in other miscellaneous income items 
at these existing properties  operating expenses increased by approximately million  from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to increased utility costs  most of which was collected from tenants in the form of utility income 
we anticipate that operating expenses in will increase slightly as compared with as a result of expected increases in utility costs  insurance  taxes and general inflation 
third party development and management services third party development and management services revenue increased by million from million in as compared to million in total third party development services revenue remained relatively constant at million in as compared to million in  an increase of million 
third party management services revenue increased by million  from million in to million in the reasons for these variances are more fully described below 
third party development and management services operating expenses increased approximately million  from million in  to million in this increase was primarily due to expenses incurred during in relation to three west virginia university fixed price projects that were in progress during which contributed million to the increase and a reserve of approximately million of development costs associated with our blinn college development project which was not awarded as anticipated 
it is possible that projects for which we have expended pre development costs will not close and that we will not be reimbursed for such costs 
the pre development costs associated therewith will ordinarily be charged against income for the then current period 
any such charge could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken 
third party development services revenue 
development services revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully be awarded such projects  the amount of the contractual fee related to the project and the timing and completion of the construction of the project 
the increase in our third party development revenue was primarily due to a slightly higher average contractual fee per project and a higher percentage of the contractual fees recognized during as compared to these factors were offset by fewer projects in progress and a decrease in construction savings revenue earned during we had eight projects in progress during with an average contractual fee of approximately million compared to in which we had projects in progress with an average contractual fee of million 
also  due to differences in the percentage of construction completed during the periods  of the total contractual fees of the projects in progress during the respective periods  approximately of the total contractual fees were recognized during compared to approximately for in addition  our third party development revenue decreased as a result of approximately million of construction savings revenue that was recognized during no construction savings revenue was earned on our third party development projects during we continue to see a very active market for third party development and construction management services with active rfps consistent with prior years 
the market has begun to expand  with colleges and universities seeking new levels of service ranging from long range planning  predevelopment consulting  and campus planning  to the more traditional historic full development and construction management services 
we pursue these projects based on relative profitability  long term relationship opportunities and geographical asset growth synergies 
third party development services revenue on campus participating properties development services revenue earned in relation to our on campus participating properties is recognized over the term of the underlying ground leases 
the decrease in development revenue earned on our on campus participating properties is primarily due to approximately million of deferred development and construction revenue recognized in upon the transfer of one of our on campus participating properties coyote village to weatherford college in april management services revenue 
third party management services revenue increased million from million in as compared to million in the increase was due to a full academic year of revenues earned related to seven new management contracts that commenced in fall we expect third party management services revenues to remain relatively constant in as compared to as the loss in any current contracts or the reduction in any current contract fees is anticipated to be offset by new contracts obtained during resident services concurrent with our commencement of operations and our designation as a reit in  certain services previously provided to residents by our properties are now provided by our trs 
these services generally consist of food service and housekeeping at callaway house  and certain resident programming activities 
these services are provided to the residents at market rates and  under an agreement between the trs and the operating partnership  payments from residents are collected by the properties on behalf of the trs in conjunction with their collection of rents 
revenue from resident services increased by million in as compared to this increase is due to reflecting only approximately months of resident services revenue  which was classified as such beginning with our ipo and concurrent formation of our trs on august  accordingly  resident services revenue for reflects a full year of revenue 
as a business strategy  our level of services provided to residents by the trs is only incidental to that which is necessary to maintain or increase occupancy 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses relating primarily to corporate operations increased million in compared to this increase was primarily due to the following items i additional expenses of million incurred in related to sarbanes oxley section compliance costs  ii a compensation charge of approximately million to reflect a separation agreement entered into with an executive officer in april  iii a full year of expenses incurred as a public company during  iv general increases in corporate staffing as a result of the growth experienced by the company in  and v normal inflationary increases in such items as payroll costs  benefits  and other related corporate items 
these increases were offset by a compensation charge of approximately million recorded during in connection with the issuance of profits interest units pius to certain of our executive and senior officers in connection with our ipo 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million in compared to primarily due to the acquisition of seven properties during the first quarter of  the opening of two owned off campus properties in august  and the opening of one owned off campus property in august in conjunction with the acquisition of the seven previously mentioned properties  a valuation was assigned to in place leases which was amortized over the average remaining lease terms of the acquired leases generally less than one year 
this contributed approximately million of additional depreciation and amortization expense in we expect depreciation and amortization in to increase significantly from primarily due to a full year s depreciation on properties acquired and placed in service during and the million of recently completed acquisitions 
amortization of deferred financing costs remained relatively constant at million for both and amortization of deferred financing costs was reduced in due to two mortgage loans paid off in connection with our ipo  which was offset by additional finance cost amortization incurred in related to debt assumed or incurred in connection with the property acquisitions closed during the first quarter of as well as finance costs incurred under our revolving credit facility 
we expect amortization of deferred financing costs in to increase from primarily due to a full year s amortization of debt assumed or incurred in connection with acquisitions made during and the debt anticipated to be assumed or incurred in connection with the million of recently completed acquisitions 
interest income interest income increased by million  from million in to million in this increase is primarily due to additional interest earned in on the remaining proceeds from our july equity offering that were invested in commercial paper and money market investments during the year 
interest expense interest expense increased million in compared to this increase was primarily due to additional interest of million related to debt assumed or incurred in relation to the acquisition of the seven previously mentioned properties in the first quarter as well as additional interest expense of million incurred in under our revolving credit facility 
approximately six months of interest was recognized under our revolving credit facility in as a result of the facility being fully paid down in july in connection with our equity offering 
this is in comparison to only approximately months of interest recognized under our revolving credit facility in due to the facility being obtained in connection with the ipo in august these increases were offset by the retirement of million in mortgage loans in connection with our ipo  which resulted in a decrease in interest expense of approximately million 
an additional million of interest was also capitalized in as compared to as a result of increased activity related to the construction of our owned off campus properties 
we anticipate that interest expense in will increase from levels due to interest expense assumed or incurred in connection with property acquisitions and increases in potential borrowing rates that may impact our floating rate on our credit facility 
other nonoperating income other non operating income for includes a gain of approximately million related to the sale of our option to acquire a interest in dobie center  an off campus student housing property held by an affiliate of our predecessor owners 
in addition  we also recognized a gain of approximately and million in and  respectively  related to insurance proceeds received for a fire that occurred at one of our owned off campus properties in a gain of approximately million was also recognized in related to insurance proceeds received for hail damage that occurred at one of our on campus participating properties in income taxes subsequent to our ipo formation transactions  our trs manages our non reit activities 
the trs is subject to federal  state and local income taxes and is required to recognize the future tax benefits attributable to deductible temporary differences between book and tax basis  to the extent that the asset will be realized 
accordingly  an initial income tax benefit of million was recorded in connection with our ipo during an income tax provision of approximately million was recorded by our trs during to better reflect our estimate of the realization of our deferred tax asset based on management s estimate of future taxable income of our trs 
unlike our predecessor  we are subject to federal  state and local income taxes as a result of the services provided by our trs  which include our third party services revenues  resident services revenues and the operations of our on campus participating properties 
as a result  the income earned by our trs  unlike our predecessor and our results from our owned off campus properties  is subject to a new level of taxation 
the amount of income taxes to be recognized is dependent on the operating results of the trs 
minority interests minority interests in represent the interest in the net income of our operating partnership held by holders of common units in our operating partnership as well as a minority partner s interest in the net income of our university village at sweet home property  which commenced operations in august minority interests in represent a minority partner s share of the net loss of four owned off campus properties 
we redeemed this minority partner s interest in connection with our ipo

these new properties contributed million of additional revenues and million of additional operating expenses during as compared with same store property operations excluding new property activity 
we had nine properties containing  beds which were operating during both and  and which had weighted average occupancy rates during these periods of and  respectively 
these properties produced revenues of million and million during and  respectively 
this increase of approximately million or was the result of the improved fall lease up and was offset by certain non rental revenues reflected as property revenues by the predecessor which are now reflected as resident services revenues in our trs 
at these existing properties  operating expenses increased million or in compared with this increase was the result of increases in operating expenses such as bad debt  maintenance  employee benefits  and taxes 
these increases were due to a combination of increases in inflation  overall higher occupancy rates and decreased collection prospects at certain properties

we had four properties containing  beds which were operating during both and  and which had average occupancy rates during these periods of and respectively 
these properties produced revenues of million and million during and  respectively 
operating expenses for our same store ocpps decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease is primarily due to reduced utility rates and improved collection prospects 
ground facility lease expense increased by million in compared with ground facility lease payments reflect the universities share of the related facilities cash flows  which have increased in as compared to the increased cash flows primarily relate to improvements in operations resulting from increased occupancy and rates as well as reductions in turn costs and bad debt expense 
third party development and management services third party development and management services revenue decreased million from million in to million in development services 
third party development services revenue for represented a decrease of million compared to this decrease was due to a combination of a lower average contractual fee per project and the percentage of the contractual fee recognized during the respective periods 
we had projects in progress during with an average contractual fee of million  as compared to in which we had ten projects in progress with an average contractual fee of million 
in addition  due to differences in the percentage of construction completed during the periods  of the total contractual fees of the projects in progress during the respective periods  was recognized on a percentage of completion basis during compared to in third party development services revenue from on campus participating properties increased primarily due to the recognition of million of deferred development fees on an on campus participating property that was transferred to weatherford college in april management services 
third party management revenues increased by million in compared with the increase was due to five new contracts that commenced in fall as well as a full year of fees from contracts that began in fall resident services concurrent with our commencement of operations and our designation as a reit  certain services previously provided to residents by our properties are now provided by our trs 
these services generally consist of food service and housekeeping at callaway house  and certain resident programming activities 
these services are provided to the residents at market rates and  under an agreement between the trs and the operating partnership  payments from residents are collected by the properties on behalf of the trs in conjunction with their collection of rents 
revenue from resident services for the year ended december  approximated million 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of corporate expenses of million for included million of expenses related to the ipo and formation transactions 
excluding these expenses  general and administrative expenses increased million in compared to the ipo and formation transactions consisted of the recognition of compensation expense of million and million in connection with the issuance of profits interest units pius and restricted stock units rsus  respectively 
the remaining increase was primarily a result of expenses incurred as a public company which were not present in the predecessor s operations such as directors compensation  investor relations and director and officer liability insurance 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to million of additional depreciation and amortization from the opening of the two owned off campus properties in august and the opening of the on campus participating property in august  as described above 
amortization of deferred financing costs increased million in compared to primarily due to the write off of million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the repayment of debt in connection with the ipo 
interest expense interest expense of million for represented a decrease of million from million in interest expense decreased due to the retirement of certain debt in connection with the ipo  which was partially offset by loan prepayment penalties incurred in connection with such debt repayment and an increase in interest expense recognized on the opening of the on campus participating property in august other income other income increased million in as compared with primarily due to gains related to two property insurance settlements 
income tax benefit subsequent to our ipo formation transactions  our trs manages our non reit activities 
the trs is subject to federal  state and local income taxes and is required to recognize the future tax benefits attributable to deductible temporary differences between book and tax basis  to the extent that the asset will be realized 
based on projected future earnings of the trs  we recorded a deferred tax asset  net of allowance  and related income tax benefit of million in connection with the formation transactions and million in connection with the change in the valuation allowance which offset the recognition of income tax expense of million from the date of the ipo to december  discontinued operations statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

the properties included in discontinued operations for the years ended december  and or december  include i the village at riverside and other non core assets that were distributed to our predecessor owners as part of the ipo  ii an on campus participating property whose ground lease was transferred to the weatherford college in april  and iii university village at san bernardino  which was sold to california state university san bernardino in january and is classified as owned off campus property held for sale as of december  please refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated and combined financial statements contained in item herein for a table summarizing the results of operations of the properties sold  distributed  or classified as held for sale during the years ended december  and cash flows comparison of years ended december  and december  operating activities for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital accounts provided approximately million  as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
changes in working capital accounts utilized million for the year ended december  while million was provided by working capital accounts for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this change was primarily the result of a million increase in accounts receivable from our third party development and management services operations due to the increased activities in these operations in as compared to additionally  various working capital accounts experienced an increase in over such as student contracts receivable and prepaid expenses due to the properties acquired or placed in service during investing activities investing activities utilized million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash utilized in investing activities during the year ended december  related primarily to the use of cash to acquire seven properties in the first quarter of and to fund the development of an additional phase of an on campus participating property  which was completed in fall this increase in cash utilized was offset by proceeds received from the sale of university village at san bernardino in january as well as a decrease in cash used to fund owned off campus development properties 
during the year ended december   three owned off campus properties were under development  of which one was completed in fall  while four properties were under development during the year ended december   of which three were completed in fall for the years ended december    and  our cash utilized in investing activities was comprised of the following year ended december  property disposition  property acquisitions  capital expenditures for on campus participating properties  capital expenditures for owned off campus properties    on campus participating property transferred to university  investments in on campus participating properties under development   investments in owned off campus properties under development    purchase of non real estate furniture  fixtures  and equipment sale of option to acquire interest in student housing property total    financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of proceeds received from our equity offering  net of offering costs  of approximately million in july other significant financing activities occurring during the year ended december  included the receipt of proceeds from a bridge loan subsequently converted to a mortgage loan in the amount of million and draws on a construction loan used to fund the development of an additional phase of an on campus participating property in the amount of approximately million 
these items were offset by the use of cash to fund distributions to our common and restricted stockholders in the amount of approximately million as well as the use of cash to pay down our revolving credit net of draws on the facility during the period in the amount of approximately million 
cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of proceeds received from our initial public offering  net of offering costs  of approximately million in august approximately million of these proceeds was used to pay down mortgage and construction loan indebtedness  and an additional million was used to redeem the interests of our predecessor owners 
in connection with the ipo  we also entered into a revolving credit facility  of which million was outstanding at december  in addition  during the year ended december   we received approximately million in proceeds from construction loans used to fund the development of three owned off campus properties 
also  a million partial quarter distribution for the third quarter was paid in november comparison of years ended december  and december  operating activities for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital accounts provided approximately million  as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
changes in working capital accounts provided approximately million for the year ended december  while million was utilized by working capital for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this change was primarily the result of a receivable for insurance proceeds in related to a fire that occurred at one of our owned off campus properties under development in fresno  california  and the subsequent receipt and use of those proceeds in to fund the related rebuild costs  as well as higher payables associated with three development projects under construction as of december  additionally  in connection with the pay down of three construction loans as part of our ipo formation transactions  certain restricted funds were released by the lender in the third quarter investing activities investing activities used million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in the cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  related primarily to the use of cash to fund the development costs at university village at fresno  university village at san bernardino  and university village at tu owned off campus construction projects  which were completed in fall additionally  in  we purchased land and funded development costs for university village at sweet home and commenced construction of a new on campus facility cullen oaks phase ii 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in connection with our ipo  we generated net proceeds of approximately million in august approximately million of our ipo proceeds were used to pay down mortgage and construction loan indebtedness and million was used to purchase the equity interests of our predecessor owners 
in addition  during  we borrowed approximately million to fund the three development projects described above 
we also used our ipo proceeds to pay off the million balance on our predecessor s line of credit 
in connection with the ipo  we also entered into a million revolving credit facility  of which million was outstanding at december  also  a million partial quarter distribution for the third quarter was paid in november structure of on campus participating properties at our on campus participating properties  the subject universities own both the land and improvements 
we then have a leasehold interest under a ground facility lease 
under the lease  we receive an annual distribution representing of these properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses which includes our management fees  debt service which includes repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
we also manage these properties under multi year management agreements and are paid a management fee representing of receipts 
we do not have access to the cash flows and working capital of these participating properties except for the annual net cash distribution as described above 
additionally  a substantial portion of these properties cash flow is dedicated to capital reserves required under the applicable property indebtedness and to the amortization of such indebtedness 
these amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties since our interest  including our right to share in the net cash available for distribution from the properties  terminates upon the amortization of their indebtedness 
our economic interest in these properties is therefore limited to our interest in the net cash flow and management and development fees from these properties  as reflected in our calculation of funds from operations modified for the operational performance of on campus participating properties ffom contained herein 
accordingly  when considering these properties contribution to our operations  we focus upon our share of these properties net cash available for distribution and the management fees that we receive from these properties  rather than upon their contribution to our gross revenues and expenses for financial reporting purposes 
the following table reflects the amounts related to our on campus participating properties included in our consolidated combined financial statements for the years ended december    and year ended december  revenues    direct operating expenses    amortization    amortization of deferred financing costs ground facility lease net operating income    interest income interest expense    other non operating income net income excludes property management fees of million  million  and for the years ended december    and  respectively

debt service expenditures for these properties totaled million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
includes the results of coyote village  which was transferred to weatherford college in april this property is classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements contained in item excludes income taxes associated with these properties  which are owned by our trs subsequent to the ipo 
liquidity and capital resources cash balances and liquidity as of december   excluding our on campus participating properties  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of december  this increase was primarily due to the completion of our equity offering in july  which generated net proceeds of approximately million  of which approximately million is remaining at december  restricted cash at our properties primarily consists of escrow accounts held by lenders and resident security deposits  as required by law in certain states 
additionally  restricted cash as of december  included million of funds held in escrow in connection with potential property acquisitions 
as of december   our short term liquidity needs included  but were not limited to  the following i anticipated distribution payments to our stockholders and unitholders totaling approximately million based on an anticipated annual distribution of per share or unit based on our current shares and units outstanding  including those required to maintain our reit status and satisfy our current distribution policy  ii remaining development costs on our callaway villas owned off campus development project funded outside of the construction loan  estimated to be approximately million  iii remaining development costs on our village at newark owned off campus development project funded outside of the construction loan  estimated to be approximately million  and iv funds for other potential future acquisitions or development projects 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements by using remaining proceeds from our recent equity offering  net cash provided by operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and permanent property level debt 
in addition  we have a shelf registration available in which we may offer up to million of an indeterminate amount of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock and securities warrants 
we may seek additional funds to undertake initiatives not contemplated by our business plan or obtain additional cushion against possible shortfalls 
we also may pursue additional financing as opportunities arise 
future financings may include a range of different sizes or types of financing  including the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
while we believe we will be able to obtain such funds  these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors  including future market conditions  our success or lack of success in penetrating our markets  our future creditworthiness  and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders  including the restrictions contained in the agreements governing our revolving credit facility 
these financings could increase our level of indebtedness or result in dilution to our equity holders 
equity offering on july   we consummated an equity offering  consisting of the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of  including  shares issued as a result of the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option in full at the closing 
the offering generated gross proceeds of million 
the aggregate proceeds to us  net of the underwriters discount and offering costs  were approximately million 
approximately million of these proceeds was used to repay the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility 
callaway villas financing in july  we obtained a new construction loan in the amount of million  of which million is subject to holdback provisions  to fund a portion of the development and construction of callaway villas  an owned off campus property scheduled to open in august we began making draws under the loan in january the loan has an initial term of months and bears interest  at the company s option  at either prime at december  or one  two  three  or six month libor plus at december  
the loan requires payments of interest only during the term of the loan and any accrued interest or outstanding borrowings become due on the maturity date of july  village at newark financing in september  we obtained a new construction loan in the amount of million to fund a portion of the development and construction of village at newark  an owned off campus property scheduled to open in summer we expect to begin making draws under the loan in the second quarter of the loan has an initial term of months and bears interest  at the company s option  at either prime at december  or one  two  or three month libor plus at december  
the term of the loan can be extended through september through the exercise of two month extension periods 
the loan requires payments of interest only through the original maturity date and the first extension period 
the loan requires monthly principal and interest payments during the second extension period based on a year amortization 
revolving credit facility on june   the company amended its million revolving credit facility to increase the size of the facility to million 
the amended facility may be expanded by up to an additional million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions 
in addition  the facility was converted from a secured facility to an unsecured facility 
the maturity date of the facility remains at august and the company continues to guarantee the operating partnership s obligations under the facility 
availability under the revolving credit facility is limited to an aggregate borrowing base amount equal to the lesser of i of the value of certain properties  calculated as set forth in the credit facility  and ii the adjusted net operating income from these properties divided by a formula amount 
the facility bears interest at a variable rate  at the company s option  based upon a base rate or one  two  three  or six month libor plus  in each case  a spread based upon the company s total leverage 
additionally  the company is required to pay an unused commitment fee ranging from to per annum  depending on the aggregate unused balance 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the revolving credit facility totaled million  bearing interest at 
in july  the company paid off the entire balance on the revolving credit facility using proceeds from its equity offering 
as of december   the total availability under the facility subject to certain financial covenants was approximately million 
the terms of the facility include certain restrictions and covenants  which limit  among other items  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  liens  and the disposition of assets 
the facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains financial covenants that  among other things  require the company to maintain certain minimum ratios of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for interest expense and fixed charges 
before june   the company may not pay distributions that exceed of funds from operations for any four consecutive quarters 
after june   the company may not pay distributions that exceed of funds from operations for any four consecutive quarters 
the financial covenants also include consolidated net worth and leverage ratio tests 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
distributions we are required to distribute of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains on an annual basis in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  we intend to make  but are not contractually bound to make  regular quarterly distributions to common stockholders and unit holders 
distributions to common stockholders are at the discretion of the board of directors 
we may be required to use borrowings under the credit facility  if necessary  to meet reit distribution requirements and maintain our reit status 
the board of directors considers market factors and our company s performance in addition to reit requirements in determining distribution levels 
on march   the company declared a fourth quarter distribution per share of which will be paid on march  to all common stockholders of record as of march  at the same time  the operating partnership will pay an equivalent amount per unit to holders of common units 
recurring capital expenditures our properties require periodic investments of capital for general capital expenditures and improvements 
our policy is to capitalize costs related to the acquisition  development  rehabilitation  construction  and improvement of properties  including interest and certain internal personnel costs related to the communities under rehabilitation and construction 
capital improvements are costs that increase the value and extend the useful life of an asset 
ordinary repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred 
recurring capital expenditures represent non incremental building improvements required to maintain current revenues and typically include appliances  carpeting and flooring  hvac equipment  kitchen bath cabinets  new roofs  site improvements and various exterior building improvements 
non recurring capital expenditures include expenditures that were taken into consideration when underwriting the purchase of a property which were considered necessary to bring the property up to operating standard  and incremental improvements that include  among other items community centers  new windows  and kitchen bath apartment upgrades 
additionally  we are required by certain of our lenders to contribute amounts to reserves for capital repairs and improvements at their mortgaged properties 
these annual contributions may exceed the amount of capital expenditures actually incurred in such year at such properties 
our historical recurring capital expenditures at our owned off campus properties  excluding the village at riverside  which was distributed to our predecessor owners in connection with the ipo  are set forth below as of and for the year ended december  average beds    total recurring capital expenditures    average per bed pre development expenditures our third party development activities have historically required us to fund pre development expenditures such as architectural fees  permits and deposits 
because the closing of a development project s financing is often subject to third party delay  we cannot always predict accurately the liquidity needs of these activities 
we frequently incur these pre development expenditures before a financing commitment has been obtained and  accordingly  bear the risk of the loss of these pre development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms 
historically  the development projects that we have been awarded have been successfully structured and financed  however  their development has at times been delayed beyond the period initially scheduled  causing revenue to be recognized in later periods 
as of december  we have capitalized approximately million in pre development costs related to awarded projects that have not yet commenced construction 
indebtedness as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness excluding unamortized debt premiums of approximately million  comprised of million in mortgage debt secured by of our owned off campus properties  million in mortgage and construction loans secured by two phases of an on campus participating property  and million in bond issuances secured by three of our on campus participating properties 
the weighted average interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness as of december  was 
all of our outstanding indebtedness is fixed rate except for our revolving credit facility  which had no outstanding balance as of december   and the cullen oaks phase ii construction loan discussed below 
as of december   approximately of our total consolidated indebtedness was variable rate debt 
owned off campus properties the weighted average interest rate of the million of owned off campus mortgage debt was as of december  each of the mortgages is a non recourse obligation subject to customary exceptions 
each of these mortgages has a year amortization  and none are cross defaulted or cross collateralized to any other indebtedness 
the loans generally may not be prepaid prior to maturity  in certain cases  prepayment is allowed  subject to prepayment penalties 
on campus participating properties three of our on campus participating properties are financed with million of outstanding project based taxable bonds 
under the terms of these financings  one of our special purpose subsidiaries publicly issued three series of taxable bonds and loaned the proceeds to three special purpose subsidiaries that each hold a separate leasehold interest 
although a default in payment by these special purpose subsidiaries could result in a default under one or more series of bonds  the indebtedness of any of these special purpose subsidiaries is not cross defaulted or cross collateralized with indebtedness of the reit  the operating partnership or other special purpose subsidiaries 
repayment of principal and interest on these bonds is insured by mbia  inc the loans encumbering the leasehold interests are non recourse  subject to customary exceptions 
cullen oaks phase i is currently encumbered by a mortgage loan originated in september in the original principal amount of approximately million 
the loan bears interest at the prime rate  or libor plus  at our election with principal amortizing on a year schedule 
we have in place an interest rate swap agreement which effectively caps the interest on the outstanding balance as of december  of approximately million at 
the loan matures in november pursuant to the leases  in the event the leasehold estate does not achieve financial break even defined as revenues less operating expenses  excluding management fees  less debt service  the applicable lessor would be required to make a rental payment  also known as the contingent payment  sufficient to achieve financial break even 
the contingent payment provision remains in effect until such time as any financing placed on the facilities would receive an investment grade rating without the contingent payment provision 
in the event that the lessor is required to make a contingent payment  future net cash flow distributions would be first applied to repay such contingent payments and then to unpaid management fees prior to normal distributions pursuant to the leases  in the event the leasehold estates do not 
in turn  we have guaranteed payment of this property s indebtedness 
in addition  in december  we obtained a construction loan to finance the cullen oaks phase ii on campus participating property  which was completed in august for each borrowing  we have the option of choosing the prime rate or libor plus 
the balance on this construction loan as of december  was approximately million  bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 
the total availability under this construction loan is million and the loan requires payments of interest only through june  at which time we have the option to extend the maturity date to november and convert the loan to a year amortization basis 
the weighted average interest rate of the indebtedness encumbering our on campus participating properties was at december  off balance sheet items we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  total thereafter long term debt        operating leases   capital leases  owned off campus development projects   severance agreement long term debt obligations reflect the payment of both principal and interest 
for long term obligations with a variable interest rate  the rate in effect at december  was assumed to remain constant over all periods presented 
includes minimum annual lease payments under the ground leases for university village at tu and village at newark 
consists of the completion costs related to callaway villas and village at newark  which are scheduled to be completed in august and summer  respectively 
the amounts do not include completion costs which are funded through the construction loans 
we have entered into a contract with a general contractor for certain phases of the construction of this project 
however  this contract does not generally cover all of the costs that are necessary to place the property into service  including the cost of furniture and marketing and leasing costs 
the unfunded commitments presented include all such costs  not only those costs that we are obligated to fund under the construction contract 
funds from operations as defined by nareit  ffo represents income loss before allocation to minority interests computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of loan origination costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we present ffo because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our ffo to our net income loss company predecessor period from period from year ended august  january  year ended december  to december  to august  december  net income loss    minority interests gain loss from disposition of real estate  real estate related depreciation and amortization total depreciation and amortization     discontinued operations depreciation and amortization furniture  fixtures  and equipment depreciation funds from operations ffo     ffo per share basic ffo per share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding basic   diluted   our ffo for the year ended december  was impacted by a series of charges totaling approximately million related to our ipo and related formation transactions 
the primary components of the charges include i piu grants of approximately million  ii rsu grants of million  and iii the write off of loan origination costs and exit fees associated with the repayment of indebtedness of approximately million 
these items were partially offset by the recognition of an initial deferred tax asset associated with the formation of our trs  resulting in an income tax benefit of million 
while our on campus participating properties contributed million  million and million to our revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively  under our participating ground leases  we and the participating university systems each receive of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service which includes significant amounts towards repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
a substantial portion of our revenues attributable to these properties is reflective of cash that is required to be used for capital expenditures and for the amortization of applicable property indebtedness 
these amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties or otherwise benefit us since our interest in the properties terminates upon the repayment of the applicable property indebtedness 
as noted above  ffo excludes gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets because these gaap items assume that the value of real estate diminishes over time 
however  unlike the ownership of our owned off campus properties  the unique features of our ownership interest in our on campus participating properties cause the value of these properties to diminish over time 
for example  since the ground facility leases under which we operate the participating properties require the reinvestment from operations of specified amounts for capital expenditures and for the repayment of debt while our interest in these properties terminates upon the repayment of the debt  such capital expenditures do not increase the value of the property to us and mortgage debt amortization only increases the equity of the ground lessor 
accordingly  when considering our ffo  we believe it is also a meaningful measure of our performance to modify ffo to exclude the operations of our on campus participating properties and to consider their impact on performance by including only that portion of our revenues from those properties that are reflective of our share of net cash flow and the management fees that we receive  both of which increase and decrease with the operating measure of the properties  a measure referred to herein as ffom

of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service including repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
amounts represent actual cash received for the year to date periods and amounts accrued for the interim periods 
as a result of using accrual based results in interim periods and cash based results for year to date periods  the sum of reported interim results may not agree to annual cash received 
development and construction management fees  including construction savings earned under the general construction contract  related to the cullen oaks phase ii on campus participating property  which was completed in august this narrower measure of performance measures our profitability for these properties in a manner that is similar to the measure of our profitability from our services business where we similarly incur no initial or ongoing capital investment in a property and derive only consequential benefits from capital expenditures and debt amortization 
we believe  however  that this narrower measure of performance is inappropriate in traditional real estate ownership structures where debt amortization and capital expenditures enhance the property owner s long term profitability from its investment 
our ffom may have limitations as an analytical tool because it reflects the unique contractual calculation of net cash flow from our on campus participating properties  which is different from that of our off campus owned properties 
additionally  ffom reflects features of our ownership interests in our on campus participating properties that are unique to us 
companies that are considered to be in our industry may not have similar ownership structures  and therefore those companies may not calculate a ffom in the same manner that we do  or at all  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap and ffo results and using our modified ffo only supplementally 
inflation our leases do not typically provide for rent escalations 
however  they typically do not have terms that extend beyond months 
accordingly  although on a short term basis we would be required to bear the impact of rising costs resulting from inflation  we have the opportunity to raise rental rates at least annually to offset such rising costs 
however  a weak economic environment or declining student enrollment at our principal universities may limit our ability to raise rental rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use fixed and floating rate debt to finance acquisitions  developments and maturing debt 
these borrowings expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common stockholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common stockholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december  and we had fixed rate debt of million and million  respectively 
holding other variables constant such as debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates basis points would cause a million and million decline in the fair value of our fixed rate debt as of december  and  respectively 
conversely  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would cause a million and million increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt as of december  and  respectively 
due to the structure of our floating rate debt and interest rate protection instruments  the impact of a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates on our net income to common stockholders and cash flows would not be significant at december  or all of our outstanding indebtedness is fixed rate except for our revolving credit facility and the cullen oaks phase ii construction loan 
our revolving credit facility had no outstanding balance at december  and bears interest at the lender s prime rate or libor plus  in each case  a spread based on our total leverage 
the cullen oaks phase ii construction loan had an outstanding balance of million at december  and bears interest at the lender s prime rate or libor plus  at our election 
we have in place an interest rate swap agreement  designated as a cash flow hedge  which effectively fixes the interest rate on the outstanding balance of the cullen oaks phase i mortgage loan at through maturity in we anticipate incurring additional variable rate indebtedness in the future  including draws under our million revolving credit facility 
we may in the future use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to such variable rate borrowings 
we do not  and do not expect to  use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes  and we expect to enter into contracts only with major financial institutions
