critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of its financial statements 
these significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
all accounting policies are important  and all policies described in notes to the consolidated financial statements should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how the company s financial performance is recorded and reported 
the company believes the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
calculation of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate due to the significant judgment  assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses  consideration of current and historical trends and the amount and timing of cash flows related to impaired loans 
please refer to the section of this report entitled balance sheet review provision and allowance for possible loan and lease losses and note and note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of the company s estimation processes and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses

loans increased by million  or  in compared to million  or  in and million  or  in the average loan growth rate over the past ten years has been 
the company s ability to grow loans in both quality and quantity is important to its ability to grow earnings 
the company s core business is lending and management maintains underwriting and pricing policies and procedures to grow revenues and not significantly increase its credit or interest rate risk exposure 
additionally  management seeks to increase revenues while controlling costs 
in  the overhead ratio non interest expense net interest income plus non interest income was compared to in and in improved overhead ratio is  in essence  evidence of improved efficiency with the use of the company s resources 
described below are details of the major components of the company s improved earnings performance 
net interest income the company s operational results primarily depend on the earnings of the bank 
the bank s earnings depend  to a large degree  on its ability to generate net interest income 
net interest income represented  and of net interest income and other income in  and  respectively 
the following discussion and analysis of net interest margin assumes and is stated on a tax equivalent basis 
that is  non taxable interest is restated at its taxable equivalent rate 
the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure the relative profitability of net interest income 
the net interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets loans  investment securities and federal funds sold and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities deposits and other borrowings 
the interest rate spread eliminates the impact of non interest bearing deposits and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the other commonly used measure is net interest margin 
the net interest margin is defined as net interest income as a percent of average total interest earning assets and takes into account the positive impact of investing non interest bearing deposits 
net interest income for the company increased by million  or  in from  and by million  or  in from net interest income at december  was million compared to million at december  and million at december  the net interest margin on interest earning assets was in  in and in on a tax equivalent basis 
beginning in early through the end of  short term interest rates dropped basis points 
through  however  short term interest rates recovered of those basis points 
comparing the interest margin in to that in  the bank s interest margin declined by basis points 
measuring the last three years  the bank s interest margin decreased basis points 
we believe management s interest rate risk strategies helped to mitigate the effects of rapidly declining and then rapidly increasing interest rates 
while banks are able to more easily maintain a steady interest margin in flat rate environments  without diligent interest rate risk management banks are susceptible to declining interest margins and earnings in rapidly changing interest rate environments 
the bank s average yield on earning assets in on a tax equivalent basis was  an increase of basis points over its average cost of funds was in  an increase of basis points from net interest income increased nonetheless over the last three years despite declining net interest margin 
this is a result of the increase in the bank s volume of earning assets 
the average balance of interest earning assets increased by million  or  in compared to million  or  for and million  or  for the bank s balance sheet has traditionally been slightly liability sensitive  but as  and progressed  management sought to become more evenly matched and perhaps slightly asset sensitive 
that is  management sought to shift to a scenario where assets re price faster than liabilities 
therefore  in a rising rate environment the bank s interest margin will tend to increase 
when market interest rates fall rapidly  as they did in and  and subsequently increase rapidly  as they did in  the interest margin needs time to respond to the rate changes 
now that rates are increasing  we believe the bank s interest margin will increase as well 
the ability of management to accomplish its objective of managing interest rate risk is largely dependent on its ability to manage the cost of funds in a competitive deposit gathering market 
we believe the impact of the fixed rates on borrowings in a falling rate environment would have been more significant in and had management not chosen to hedge those fixed rates with the million notional amount swap contract which is described in note and note to the financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
the swap contract reduced interest expense in by thousand 
during  that benefit was reduced to thousand since short term rates had risen above the fixed rate in the swap contract 
there are approximately months remaining on the contractual term of the swap and  of course  if short term rates continue to increase  the cost of the swap will increase  but not as much as the expected yield on interest bearing assets 
the following table shows  for the past three years  the relationship between interest income and interest expense and the average daily balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis assuming a rate of table average consolidated balance sheets and net interest analysis in thousands for the years ended december  average balance interest yield rate average balance interest yield rate average balance interest yield rate assets interest earnings assets federal funds sold investments taxable tax exempt total investments loans including loan fees taxable tax exempt total loans total interest earning assets other non interest earnings assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing liabilities deposits demand savings time fhlb advances other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing deposits other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity excess of interest earning assets over interest bearing liabilities ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities net interest income tax equivalent net interest spread net interest margin on interest earning assets tax equivalent adjustments investments loans net interest income non accrual loans and the interest income that was recorded on these loans are included in the yield calculation for loans in all periods reported 
the following table shows the relative impact on net interest income of changes in the annual average daily outstanding balances volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned rate by the bank on such assets and liabilities 
variances resulting from a combination of changes in rate and volume are allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each category

the increase in other income during is primarily due to a gain on investment securities available for sale in the amount of thousand 
management rarely elects to sell investment securities 
however  this particular sale strategy allowed the bank to reposition its portfolio for rising rates  recognize the gain associated with the sale of the investment securities and accomplish both by selling million of bonds  or approximately of the portfolio 
service charges on deposit accounts have stabilized from to after having increased over per year over the previous three years

comparing to  the bank experienced increased salary costs in the amount of thousand  or 
the increase was attributable to annual raises for officers and staff which averaged about 
additionally  the full time equivalent number of employees increased from as of december  to as of december  the primary reason for the increase in full time equivalent employees was personnel added when the mirror lake office opened  increased support staff in the lending and compliance departments necessitated by a need to manage the rapid loan growth of the bank  and increased staffing for two new branches scheduled to open in spring of profit sharing and bonus costs increased thousand  or 
profit sharing and officer and employee bonuses  which are largely performance based  increased as a result of the bank s increased profitability 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits for the year ended as compared to was attributable to a number of factors 
salary costs increased by thousand  or  primarily attributable to annual raises since the full time equivalent number of employees did not significantly change from to profit sharing and bonus costs increased thousand  or  attributable to a bonus program that was introduced in for the lending staff in an effort to increase loan production 
profit sharing and bonuses also increased slightly because of increased profitability  increases in bonus percentages and improved asset quality 
health insurance costs increased by thousand  or 
the increase was attributable to a premium increase by the company s health insurance carrier 
the increase in occupancy expense in as compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in depreciation expense of thousand  or 
this increase in depreciation expense is due to the mirror lake branch facility that was placed in service in february of the remainder of the increase was attributable to the addition of utilities  telephone and other occupancy costs for the mirror lake branch

income taxes  expressed as a percentage of earnings before income taxes the effective tax rate  declined to in  from in and in the decline in effective tax rate over the past three years is primarily attributable to the impact of the purchase of tax credits and other tax advantaged instruments such as municipal securities by the bank

the year average growth rate for the bank s assets  loans and deposits is  and  respectively 
the earnings and asset growth over the past two years is attributable to robust commercial and residential growth in the bank s market area 
the company has experienced significant loan growth with low historical credit loss 
the average net charge off of loans has been less than 
percent of average loans over the past years 
total assets at december  were million  representing a million  or  increase from december  total loans increased million  or  during as management attempted to take advantage of continued loan demand 
total deposits increased million  or  from to which allowed the bank to pay off federal home loan bank borrowings in the amount of million 
loan demand rebounded in the last half of after a decline in the early part of that year and has remained robust through with much of the growth concentrated in the second half of and the first half of the increase in deposits in was attributable to an increase in non interest bearing demand accounts of million  or  an increase in interest bearing demand of million  or  and an increase in time deposit accounts of million  or 
much of the deposit growth million came from growth in time deposit accounts in excess of  and much of that growth million was attributable to brokered time deposits  which were priced lower than local market time deposits 
in  the bank funded its loan growth with deposit growth 
in fact  because of the flatness of the yield curve  the bank was able to gather time deposits early in with three  four and five year maturities for the cost of short term time deposits in the latter part of during and  five de novo banks began their operations in  or continguous to  our primary service area 
the competition for funding increased significantly in and as loan growth outpaced deposit growth in carroll and douglas counties 
the funding landscape has changed and  along with it  the bank s deposit strategy since the beginning of in its almost year history  the bank has relied on in market deposits to fund its balance sheet growth 
because of the continued development of metropolitan atlanta and its movement westward  however  loan demand has preceded the actual movement of deposits 
management expects that this dynamic will continue and intends to expand its deposit gathering strategy towards greater use of wholesale  or out of market  funding sources as loan demand remains high 
investments the company s available for sale investment portfolio of million as of december  consisted primarily of debt securities  which provide the company with a source of liquidity  a stable source of income  and a vehicle to implement asset and liability management strategies 
the available for sale securities portfolio increased million  or  over december  the company believes its investment portfolio provides a balance to interest rate and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet 
the portfolio also provides a vehicle for the investment of available funds and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain public deposits 
securities reported as available for sale are stated at fair value 
these securities may be sold  retained until maturity  or pledged as collateral for liquidity and borrowing in response to changing interest rates  changes in prepayment risk and other factors as part of the company s overall asset liability management strategy 
investment securities held to maturity are stated at amortized cost and totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  when compared to the year ended the increase is attributable to the purchase of banking industry issued trust preferred securities from various issuers across the united states and particularly the southeast 
the company has the intent and ability to hold these securities until maturity

yields on tax exempt securities are calculated on a tax equivalent basis 
loans loan concentrations are defined as aggregate credits extended to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities or resident in the same geographic region  which would cause them to be similarly affected by economic or other conditions 
the bank  on a routine basis  evaluates these concentrations for purposes of policing its concentrations and making necessary adjustments in its lending practices to reflect current economic conditions  loan to deposit ratios  and industry trends 
the primary types of loans in the bank s portfolio are residential mortgages and home equity loans  commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  and consumer installment loans 
generally  the bank underwrites loans based upon the borrower s debt service capacity or cash flow  a consideration of past performance on loans from other creditors as well as an evaluation of the collateral securing the loan 
with some exceptions  the bank s general policy is to employ relatively conservative underwriting policies  primarily in the analysis of borrowers debt service coverage capabilities for commercial and commercial real estate loans  while emphasizing lower gross debt ratios for consumer loans and lower loan to value ratios for all types of real estate loans 
given the localized nature of the bank s lending activities  the primary risk factor affecting the portfolio as a whole is the health of the local economy in the west georgia area and its effects on the value of local real estate and the incomes of local professionals and business firms 
loans to directors  executive officers and principal shareholders of the company and to directors and officers of the bank are subject to limitations of the federal reserve  the principal effect of which is to require that extensions of credit by the bank to executive officers  directors  and ten percent shareholders satisfy certain standards 
the bank routinely makes loans in the ordinary course of business to certain directors and executive officers of the company and the bank  their associates  and members of their immediate families 
in accordance with federal reserve guidelines  these loans are made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing for comparable transactions with others and do not involve more than normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features 
as of december   loans outstanding to directors and executive officers of the company and the bank  their associates and members of their immediate families totaled million  which represented approximately of total loans as of that date 
as of december   none of these loans outstanding from the bank to related parties were non accrual  past due  restructured or considered by management to be a potential problem loan

the percentage of the allowance for loan losses expressed as a percentage of total loans increased from and  taking into account a slight increase in nonperforming and adversely rated loans in net charge offs were thousand  thousand and thousand during  and  respectively 
the company has an independent loan review function 
all loans are placed in loan grade categories which are consistent with those used by the bank s regulators 
all loans are constantly monitored by the loan officer and the loan review function for credit quality  consistency and accuracy 
through this grading process  the bank assures the timely recognition of credit risks 
in general  as credit risk increases  the level of the allowance for loan loss will also increase 
a formal allowance for loan loss adequacy test is performed at each month end 
specific amounts of loss are estimated on problem loans and historical loss percentages are applied to the balance of the portfolio using certain portfolio stratifications 
additionally  the evaluation takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions  regulatory examination results  and the existence of loan concentrations 
management s judgment in determining the adequacy of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans 
these evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay  overall portfolio quality  and review of specific problem loans 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management uses a loan grading system that rates loans in eight different categories 
grades five through eight  which represent criticized or classified loans  are assigned allocations of loss based on management s estimate of potential loss that is generally based on historical losses and or collateral deficiencies 
loans graded one through four are stratified by type and allocated loss ranges based on historical loss experience for the strata 
the combination of these results is compared monthly to the recorded allowance for loan losses and material differences are adjusted by increasing or decreasing the provision for loan losses 
loans deemed to be impaired are evaluated individually to measure the probable loss  if any  in the credit 
management uses an internal loan reviewer at times  supplemented by third party service providers who is independent of the lending function to challenge and corroborate the loan grading system and provide additional analysis in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the future provisions for estimated loan losses 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
however  management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and a change in the borrowers ability to repay 
in addition  regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such regulators may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
management of the company realizes the importance of maintaining an adequate allowance for loan losses 
through a professional loan review function and effective loan officer identification program  management believes it is able to recognize weaknesses in the loan portfolio in a timely manner 
early identification of deteriorating credit attributes allows management to take a proactive role in documenting an established plan to enhance the company s position and minimize the potential for loss 
through the problem loan identification program outlined above  management is able to identify those loans that exhibit weakness and classify them on a classified and criticized loan list 
the company s migration analysis assigns historical loss amounts to pools of loans according to classifications of risk ratings to calculate a general allowance to the overall portfolio 
in cases where significant weaknesses exist in a specific loan  a specific reserve is assigned to such loan in addition to the general allowance 
the company also evaluates the risks associated with concentrations in credit 
if it is necessary to assign an allowance related to concentrations of credit  the company adds a specific reserve related to such risks

as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans are classified as non accrual generally when they are past due in principal or interest payments for more than days or it is otherwise not reasonable to expect collection of principal and interest under the original terms 
exceptions are allowed for day past due loans when such loans are well secured and in process of collection 
generally  payments received on non accrual loans are applied directly to principal 
the bank s loan review function monitors selected accruing loans for which general economic conditions or changes within a particular industry could cause the borrowers financial difficulties 
the loan review function also identifies loans with high degrees of credit or other risks 
the focus of loan review and management is to maintain a low level of non performing assets and return current non performing assets to earning status 
management is unaware of any known trends  events or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or operations

to meet these obligations  the bank keeps cash on hand  maintains account balances with its correspondent banks  and purchases and sells federal funds and other short term investments 
asset and liability maturities are monitored in an attempt to match these variables to meet liquidity needs 
it is the policy of the bank to monitor its liquidity to meet regulatory requirements and local funding requirements 
management believes that the bank s current level of liquidity is adequate to meet its needs 
the bank maintains relationships with correspondent banks including the federal home loan bank fhlb that can provide funds to it on short notice  if needed 
the bank has arrangements with correspondent and commercial banks for short term unsecured advances up to million

in addition  subject to collateral availability  the bank has a line of credit with the fhlb from which the bank had drawn million as of december  for additional details on the line of credit with the fhlb see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s cash flows are composed of three classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  and cash flows from financing activities 
cash and cash equivalents amounted to million at december   which represented an increase of million from december  the increase was primarily attributable to net cash provided by operating activities of million since net cash provided by financing activities of million was essentially the same as net cash used by investing activities of million 
the major cash flows from investing activities were attributable to a net change in loans of million and a net change in investment securities both available for sale and held to maturity investment securitise of million 
the most notable cash flows from financing activities were attributable to a net change in deposits of million and repayment of federal home loan bank advances of million  million of which was redrawn in january in  management concentrated on investing the excess liquidity that was on the bank s balance sheet in cash and cash equivalents decreased by million in the cash flows were attributable to million cash generated by operating activities  million of cash used by investing activities million for loans and million for investment securities and million of cash generated from financing activities million from deposit growth and million from advances from the fhlb

obligation total less than year years years more than years deposits without stated maturity certificates of deposit federal home loan bank advances total off balance sheet risk through the operations of the bank  the company has made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of its business activities 
these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to the bank s customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time 
at december   the bank had issued commitments to extend credit of million through various types of commercial lending arrangements and additional commitments through standby letters of credit of million 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on its credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  commercial and residential real estate 
the company manages the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes 
because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
if needed to fund these outstanding commitments  the company has the ability to liquidate federal funds sold or securities available for sale or on a short term basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions 
asset liability management it is the company s objective to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory  consistent level of profitability within the framework of established cash  loan  investment  borrowing and capital policies 
certain officers are charged with the responsibility for monitoring policies and procedures that are designed to ensure acceptable composition of the asset liability mix 
it is the overall philosophy of management to support asset growth primarily through growth of deposits and borrowing strategies  which minimize the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the objective of the policy is to control interest sensitive assets and liabilities so as to minimize the impact of substantial movements in interest rates on earnings 
the asset liability mix is monitored on a regular basis 
a report reflecting the interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities is prepared and presented to management and the asset liability management committee on at least a quarterly basis 
one method to measure a bank s interest rate exposure is through its repricing gap 
the gap is calculated by taking all assets that reprice or mature within a given time frame and subtracting all liabilities that reprice or mature within that time frame 
the difference between these two amounts is called the gap  the amount of either liabilities or assets that will reprice without a corresponding asset or liability repricing 
a negative gap more liabilities repricing than assets generally indicates that the bank s net interest income will decrease if interest rates rise and will increase if interest rates fall 
a positive gap generally indicates that the bank s net interest income will decrease if rates fall and will increase if rates rise 
due to inherent limitations in traditional gap analysis  the company also employs more sophisticated modeling techniques to monitor potential changes in net interest income  net income and the market value of portfolio equity under various interest rate scenarios 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates  arising primarily from interest rate risk in the company s loan and investment portfolios  which can significantly impact the company s profitability 
net interest income can be adversely impacted where assets and liabilities do not react the same to changes in interest rates 
at year end  the estimated impact of an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in an increase in net interest income over a month period of  with a comparable decrease in interest rates resulting in a decrease in net interest income of 
management finds the above methodologies meaningful for evaluating market risk sensitivity  however  other factors can affect net interest income  such as levels of non earning assets and changes in portfolio composition and volume 
the following table summarizes the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  that are expected to mature  prepay or reprice in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets or liabilities that mature or reprice during a particular period was determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due  and fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities are included in the periods in which they are anticipated to be repaid based on scheduled maturities  although the cash flows received often differ from scheduled maturities 
the company s savings accounts and interest bearing demand accounts now and money market deposit accounts  which are generally subject to immediate withdrawal  are included in the one year or less category  although historical experience has proven these deposits to be less interest rate sensitive over the course of a year and are subject to management s control

the above chart indicates an excess of assets repricing or maturing within one year  thus a rise in interest rates would theoretically cause the company s net interest income to increase 
however  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees or at different points in time to changes in market interest rates 
such is the case in analyzing now demand  money market and savings accounts  which are disclosed in the one year or less category 
those liabilities do not necessarily reprice as quickly or to the same degree as rates in general 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
changes in interest rates  prepayment rates  early withdrawal levels and the ability of borrowers to service their debt  among other factors  may change significantly from the assumptions made in the table 
impact of inflation  changing prices and monetary policies the primary effect of inflation on the company s operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve 
the federal reserve implements a national monetary policy such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowing by banks  and establishment of reserve requirements against bank deposits 
the actions of the federal reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and affect the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature  timing and impact of any future changes in federal monetary and fiscal policies on the company and its results of operations are not predictable
