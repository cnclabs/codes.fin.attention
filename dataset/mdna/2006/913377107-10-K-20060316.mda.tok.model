medicare opportunity we believe that attractive growth opportunities exist in providing a range of products  particularly health insurance  to the growing senior market 
at present  more than million americans are eligible for medicare  the federal program that offers basic hospital and medical insurance to people over years old and certain disabled people under the age of standard medicare coverage does not cover prescription drugs except as required in the course of a covered hospital stay 
according to the us census bureau  more than million americans turn in the united states each year  and this number is expected to grow as the so called baby boomers begin to turn in addition  many large employers who traditionally provided medical and prescription drug coverage to their retirees have begun to curtail these benefits 
finally  the passage of the medicare modernization act of the mma demonstrated the federal government s commitment to increase the healthcare options available to medicare beneficiaries through the expansion of medicare managed care plans medicare advantage and the authorization of a subsidized prescription drug insurance benefit pursuant to part d 
taken together  these conditions present significant opportunities for us to increase the sale of our products 
our strategy the principal components of our business strategy are to build our senior health insurance business by offering a broad array of products  including medicare advantage  medicare supplement and medicare select  and medicare part d drug benefit  build distribution with an emphasis on expanding our senior solutions brand  sell complementary senior market and specialty health products through our distribution networks  build our senior market administrative services business  and continue to complement our internal growth through opportunistic acquisitions 
medicare advantage as a result of the increased reimbursement rates from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms  the federal agency that administers the medicare advantage program  medicare advantage plans are able to offer more attractive benefits including enhanced prescription drug coverage pursuant to part d 
consequently  we believe that enrollment in medicare advantage programs is likely to increase in the coming years 
we entered the medicare advantage business in with the acquisition of heritage health systems  inc which operates medicare advantage coordinated care plans in southeastern texas 
heritage has expanded its service area to include counties in texas  and  in  has begun to offer an hmo product in three counties in florida brevard  broward and miami dade 
in  we began to offer medicare advantage pffs plans in new york and pennsylvania 
as of january  we are marketing pffs plans in a total of states 
medicare supplement medicare supplement insurance reimburses the policyholder for certain expenses  such as deductibles and co pays  that are not covered by standard medicare coverage this coverage is designed for people who want the freedom to choose providers who participate in the standard medicare program  as opposed to the more restrictive networks that exist in medicare advantage products 
in the past ten years  we have become a successful provider of medicare supplement coverage 
we believe that the market for medicare supplement products will continue to be attractive  especially because many seniors may lose similar coverage that had previously been offered to them as a retiree benefit by their former employers 
medicare part d effective january   private insurers were permitted to sponsor insured stand alone prescription drug benefit plans pdp s pursuant to part d  which was established by the mma 
a portion of the premium for this insurance is paid by the federal government  and the balance  if any  is paid by the individuals who enroll 
the federal government will also provide additional subsidies in the form of premium support and coverage of the cost sharing elements of the plan for certain low income medicare beneficiaries 
we have been approved to offer these programs in of the regions that have been established for this program 
our operating segments our business consists of five principal business segments senior managed care medicare advantage  senior market health insurance  specialty health insurance  life insurance and annuity  and senior administrative services 
we also report the corporate activities of our holding company in a separate segment

senior managed care medicare advantage we operate medicare advantage coordinated care plans in counties in southeastern texas  counties in oklahoma and counties in florida  and medicare advantage pffs plans in states 
medicare advantage coordinated care plans hmo plans 
selectcare of texas  the health plan operated by heritage  offers coordinated care plans in counties in houston and southeastern texas 
the plan provides all basic medicare covered benefits with reduced member cost sharing as well as additional supplemental benefits  including a defined prescription drug benefit 
this coordinated care product is built around contracted networks of providers who  in connection with the health plan  coordinate an active medical management program 
in addition to a monthly payment per member from cms  for certain products  the plan may collect a monthly premium from its members 
this plan is distributed by heritage s direct sales force  and our career agents through senior solutions centers in the coverage areas 
as of december   selectcare of texas had approximately  members enrolled  representing million of annualized premium in force 
through selectcare of oklahoma  heritage offers a special needs plan with benefits focused on medicare beneficiaries who are institutionalized 
in addition  we began to offer a coordinated care plan in three counties in florida brevard  broward and miami dade in medicare advantage private fee for service plans 
pffs plans provide enhanced health care benefits compared to traditional medicare  subject to cost sharing and other limitations 
there are limited provider network restrictions  which allow the members to have more flexibility in the delivery of their health care services than other medicare advantage plans 
in addition to a fixed monthly payment per member from cms  individuals in these plans pay a monthly premium 
in june  we began enrolling members in pffs plans in certain counties of new york and pennsylvania 
the pffs products are distributed by our independent agents in the coverage areas 
as of december   approximately  members were enrolled in the program generating approximately million of annualized revenue 
as of january  we are offering pffs in a total of states through our career and independent agents

our primary products are medicare supplement and medicare select 
beginning in  we will also offer a stand alone prescription drug benefit  which will be reported in this segment 
as of december   we had million of gross premiums in force in this segment 
medicare supplement 
under federal and national association of insurance commissioners naic model regulations adopted in nearly all states  there are standard medicare supplement plans plans a through l and high deductible plans f and j 
these policies provide supplemental coverage for many of the medical expenses that the basic medicare program does not cover  such as deductibles  coinsurance and specified losses that exceed the federal program s maximum benefits 
plan a provides the least extensive coverage  while plan j provides the most extensive coverage 
in some areas  we also sell medicare select policies in conjunction with hospitals that contract with us to waive the medicare part a deductible 
these products are guaranteed renewable for the lifetime of the policyholder  which means that we cannot cancel the policy but we can seek to increase premium rates on existing and future policies issued based upon our actual claims experience 
we monitor the claims experience and  when necessary  apply for rate increases in the states in which we sell the products 
these rate increases are subject to state regulatory approval and federal and state loss ratio requirements 
medicare part d 
part d  which was established by the mma  created a structure in which private insurance companies and medicare advantage plans will offer medicare sponsored prescription drug insurance plans to medicare beneficiaries 
the federal government will support part d through a combination of direct subsidies of premium  risk adjustors  stop loss reinsurance and risk corridors 
further  the federal government will provide additional subsidies to medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for medicaid dual eligible and other low income subsidy lis beneficiaries 
in march  we entered into a strategic alliance with pharmacare  a pharmacy benefits manager pbm that is a wholly owned subsidiary of cvs 
pharmacare is the fourth largest pbm in the nation  covering more than million lives 
the essential elements of the strategic alliance are three of our insurance subsidiaries applied to and were approved by cms to become a prescription drug plan sponsor pdp s in of the regions designated by cms  thereby becoming eligible to offer the medicare approved plans in those regions 
the pdp s have contracted with pharmacare to provide the full range of pbm services required to operate the pdp s 
a subsidiary of pharmacare has agreed to reinsure approximately half of the risk assumed by our pdp s 
cvs pharmacy stores have assisted in the marketing of our pdp s on a non exclusive basis  subject to the rules established by cms 
dual eligibles dual eligible beneficiaries who did not enroll themselves in a pdp were automatically assigned on a pro rata basis by cms among the pdp s which submitted bids below the applicable regional benchmarks for standard plans 
the standard bids of our pdp s were below the applicable regional benchmark in regions thus making us eligible to receive auto assignment of the dual eligibles in those regions 
dual eligible beneficiaries can change their pdp each month  and some of these beneficiaries have already changed plans 
as a result  there can be no assurance that the dual eligible beneficiaries who are automatically assigned to us will stay in our pdp s 
low income subsidy medicare beneficiaries who qualify for the lis can choose to enroll in the pdp of their choice 
in may  those beneficiaries who qualify for this subsidy but do not so enroll will be automatically assigned by cms to one of the pdp s whose bids for the standard product fall below the applicable regional benchmark 
marketing our efforts to market our products under the trademarked brand name  prescription pathway sm  have several components including marketing to our current medicare supplement policyholders  marketing through our distribution force and marketing through pharmacies  including cvs

fixed benefit accident and health products provide three principal types of benefits disability fixed periodic payments to an insured who becomes disabled and unable to work due to an accident or sickness  hospital fixed periodic payments to an insured who becomes hospitalized  and surgical fixed single payments that vary in amount for specified surgical or diagnostic procedures 
because the benefits we provide are fixed in amount at the time of policy issuance and are not intended to provide full reimbursement for medical and hospital expenses  payment amounts are not generally affected by inflation or the rising cost of health care services

in addition  the reinsurer pays us allowances to cover commissions  cost of administering the policies and premium taxes 
under yearly renewable term treaties  the reinsurer receives premiums at an agreed upon rate for its share of the risk on a yearly renewable term basis

there is no assurance that if any of our reinsurance agreements were canceled we would be able to obtain other reinsurance arrangements on satisfactory terms 
we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
we are obligated to pay claims in the event that a reinsurer to whom we have ceded an insured claim fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement

reinsurance of life insurance and annuity senior life insurance products currently being issued are reinsured under quota share coinsurance agreements  except for certain states where our retention is 
our whole life products currently being issued are reinsured on a yearly renewable term basis for amounts in excess of underwriting procedures premiums charged on insurance products are based  in part  on assumptions about expected mortality and morbidity experience 
we have adopted and follow detailed uniform underwriting procedures designed to assess and quantify various insurance risks before issuing individual life insurance  health insurance policies and annuity policies to individuals 
these procedures are generally based on industry practices  reinsurer underwriting manuals and our prior underwriting experience 
to implement these procedures  our insurance company subsidiaries employ an experienced professional underwriting staff 
applications for insurance are reviewed on the basis of the answers that the customer provides to the application questions 
where appropriate to the type and amount of insurance applied for and the applicant s age and medical history  additional information is required  such as medical examinations  statements from doctors who have treated the applicant in the past and  where indicated  special medical tests 
if deemed necessary  we use investigative services to supplement and substantiate information 
for certain coverages  we may verify information with the applicant by telephone 
after reviewing the information collected  we either issue the policy as applied for on a standard basis  issue the policy with an extra premium charge due to unfavorable factors  issue the policy excluding benefits for certain conditions  either permanently or for a period of time  or reject the application 
for some of our coverages  we have adopted simplified policy issue procedures in which the applicant submits an application for coverage typically containing only a few health related questions instead of a complete medical history 
under regulations promulgated by the naic and adopted as a result of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of  we are prohibited from using medical underwriting criteria for our medicare supplement policies for certain first time purchasers and for dis enrollees from health maintenance organizations hmos 
if a person applies for insurance within six months after becoming eligible by reason of age  or disability in some circumstances  the application may not be rejected due to medical conditions 
for other prospective medicare supplement policyholders  such as senior citizens who are purchasing our products  the underwriting procedures are limited based upon standard industry practices 
in new york and some other states  some of our products  including medicare supplement  are subject to guaranteed issue community rating laws that severely limit or prevent underwriting of individual applications 
see regulation section of this document 
additionally  we are not permitted to underwrite for new members for our medicare advantage hmo plan or our pffs plans 
reserves in accordance with applicable insurance regulations  we have established  and carry as liabilities in our statutory financial statements  actuarially determined reserves that are calculated to satisfy our policy and contract obligations 
reserves  together with premiums to be received on outstanding policies and contracts and interest at assumed rates on such amounts  are calculated to be sufficient to satisfy policy and contract obligations 
the actuarial factors used in determining reserves for life insurance policies are based on statutorily prescribed mortality tables and interest rates 
in addition  reserves for accident and health insurance policies use prescribed or permitted morbidity tables 
reserves are also maintained for unearned premiums  for premium deposits  for claims that have been reported and are in the process of being paid or contested and for our estimate for claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported 
the reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements are calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these reserves are determined based on our best estimates of mortality and morbidity  persistency  expenses and investment income 
we use the net level premium method for all non interest sensitive products and the retrospective deposit method for interest sensitive products 
gaap reserves differ from statutory reserves due to the use of different assumptions regarding mortality and morbidity  interest rates and the introduction of lapse assumptions into the gaap reserve calculation 
when we acquire blocks of insurance policies or insurers owning blocks of policies  our assessment of the adequacy of the transferred policy liabilities is subject to risks and uncertainties 
with acquired and existing businesses  we may from time to time need to increase our claims reserves significantly in excess of those estimated 
an inadequate estimate in reserves could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
provider arrangements we provide health care services to members enrolled in our medicare advantage coordinated care plans through a network of contracted providers  including physicians  other clinical providers  hospitals  a variety of outpatient facilities and the full range of ancillary provider services 
these ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services  medical equipment services  home health agencies  mental health providers  rehabilitation facilities  skilled nursing facilities  optical services  and pharmacies 
we use a wide range of systems and processes to organize and deliver needed health care services to our members 
the key steps in this process include the careful selection of primary care physicians to provide overall care management and care coordination of members  the selection of specialists by the primary care physicians  contracting for the balance of needed services based on the preference and experience of the local physicians  and the full range of medical management systems required to support the primary care and specialist physicians 
we employ quality assessment and recredentialing programs to ensure that target goals relating to the provision of quality patient care are met 
the medical management systems include an inpatient hospitalist program  selected authorization of target services  case management  prescription drug management and disease management 
our hospitalist programs use specially trained physicians to manage the entire range of our members medical care during hospital admissions and to coordinate the members discharge and post discharge care 
these various medical management systems are integrated through a care coordination information system to provide clinical and administrative information to support the medical management process 
our disease management programs relate to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure  coronary artery disease  asthma related illness  end stage renal disease  diabetes  cancer  and certain other conditions 
our health plans usually contract with hospitals based on medicare s diagnosis related group drg methodology  which is an all inclusive rate per admission 
outpatient facilities generally are contracted on medicare s ambulatory payment classification apc methodology  or a percentage of billed charges which approximates apc reimbursement 
physicians and other providers are contracted on a capitation or fee for service basis  utilizing medicare s resource based relative value scale rbrvs methodology 
under a capitation arrangement  physicians receive a monthly fixed fee for each member  regardless of the medical services provided to the member 
our provider contracts with network primary care physicians and specialists generally have terms of one year  with automatic renewal for successive one year terms 
we may terminate these contracts for cause  based on provider conduct or other appropriate reasons  subject to laws giving providers due process rights 
the contracts generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon or days prior written notice 
our contracts with hospitals generally have terms of one to two years  with automatic renewal for successive one year terms 
we may terminate these contracts for cause  based on provider misconduct or other appropriate reasons 
our hospital contracts generally may be cancelled by either party without cause upon days prior written notice 
competition the life and accident and health insurance and managed care industries in north america are highly competitive 
there are approximately  life and accident and health insurance companies and approximately managed care organizations operating in the united states 
we compete with numerous other insurance and managed care companies on a national basis plus other regional insurance companies and financial services companies  including health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations  and other health care related institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements 
we may be at a disadvantage because many of these organizations have been in business for a longer period of time and have substantially greater capital  larger and more diversified portfolios of life and health insurance policies  larger agency sales operations and higher ratings than we do 
in addition  it has become increasingly difficult for smaller and mid size companies to compete effectively with these larger competitors for insurance product sales in part as a result of heightened consumer and agent awareness of the ratings and financial size of companies 
we believe we can meet these competitive pressures by offering a high level of service and accessibility to our field force and by developing specialized products and marketing approaches 
we also believe that our policies and premium rates  as well as the commissions paid to our sales agents  are generally competitive with those offered by other companies selling similar types of products in the same jurisdictions 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than some other insurance companies  allowing us to offer competitive rates while maintaining underwriting margins 
in the case of our medicare supplement business  low expense levels are necessary in order to meet state mandated loss ratios and achieve the desired underwriting margins 
also  we believe our disciplined underwriting procedures  pricing practices  effective rate management and related staff  our quality customer service  our significant market position in certain geographic areas  the quality of our distribution network and our appropriate financial strength  provide additional strength to compete effectively 
in addition  we compete with other managed care organizations for government healthcare program contracts  renewals of those government contracts  members and providers 
many of our competitors are large companies that have greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do 
in the medicare managed care market  our primary competitors for contracts  members and providers are national and regional commercial managed care organizations that serve medicare recipients and provider sponsored organizations 
beginning in  a new regional medicare preferred provider organization  or medicare ppo  program has been implemented pursuant to the mma 
medicare ppo s allow their members more flexibility to select physicians than other medicare advantage plans  such as hmos  which often require members to coordinate with a primary care physician 
regional medicare ppo plans will compete with local medicare advantage hmo plans  including the plans we offer  and with our medicare supplement business 
in addition  several of our competitors have introduced highly competitive pffs plans that compete with our medicare advantage and medicare supplement products 
recently  the increased competition from other medicare supplement carriers  as well as from medicare advantage plans  has affected our production of medicare supplement business and has caused more lapsation of in force business than we had anticipated 
ratings increased public and regulatory concerns regarding the financial stability of insurance companies have resulted in policyholders placing greater emphasis upon company ratings and have created some measure of competitive advantage for insurance carriers with higher ratings 
am best is considered to be a leading insurance company rating agency 
in evaluating a company s financial and operating performance  am best reviews profitability  leverage and liquidity as well as the quality of the book of business  the adequacy and soundness of reinsurance programs  the quality and estimated market value of assets  reserve adequacy and the experience and competence of management 
am best s ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders  agents  insurance brokers and intermediaries and are not directed to the protection of investors 
currently  am best maintains ratings of b on american pioneer  american progressive  constitution life  penncorp life canada  pennsylvania life  and pyramid life and b on union bankers and selectcare of texas 
these b and b ratings mean that  in am best s opinion  these companies have demonstrated very good overall performance when compared to standards it has established and have a good ability to meet their obligations to policyholders and are in the secure category of all companies rated by am best 
am best does not rate our other insurance company subsidiaries 
standard poor s ratings service currently assigns its bbb counterparty credit and financial strength ratings to our american pioneer  american progressive  pennsylvania life and penncorp life canada subsidiaries 
this rating means that in standard poor s opinion  these companies have good financial security characteristics  but are more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than are insurers that are rated higher by standard poor s 
a plus or minus shows standard poor s opinion of the relative standing of the insurer within a rating category 
standard poor s rating service currently assigns its bbb counterparty credit rating on our amended credit facility 
this investment grade rating means the obligation exhibits adequate protection parameters 
in february   standard poor s ratings service revised the outlook to negative from stable on the insurer financial strength rating and counterparty credit ratings as well as the counterparty credit rating on our amended credit facility 
the outlook revision reflected earnings for the company for that were below expectations 
our insurance company subsidiaries are not currently rated by moody s investors service or fitch ratings 
although a higher rating by am best  standard poor s or another insurance rating organization could have a favorable effect on our business  we believe that our competitive pricing  effective rate management  quality customer service and effective marketing has enabled  and will continue to enable  our insurance company subsidiaries to compete effectively 
regulation general our insurance company subsidiaries and health plan affiliates are subject to the laws  regulations and supervision of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled  as well as certain federal laws 
the purpose of those laws and regulations is primarily to provide safeguards for policyholders rather than to protect the interest of shareholders 
government regulation of insurance and health care products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and to interpret and enforce laws and rules 
the passing of the medicare modernization act of  or mma  represents the most sweeping changes to medicare since the balanced budget act of changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically 
these regulatory revisions could affect our operations and financial results 
also  it may become increasingly difficult to control medical costs if federal and state bodies continue to consider and enact significant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and regulations 
federal regulation medicare medicare is a federal program that provides eligible persons age and over and some disabled persons a variety of hospital and medical insurance benefits 
medicare beneficiaries have the option to enroll in a medicare advantage plan as an hmo benefit in areas where such a plan is offered 
under medicare advantage  managed care plans contract with cms to provide comparable medicare benefits as a traditional fee for service medicare program in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member that varies based on the county in which a member resides 
the mma made many significant changes to the medicare fee for service and medicare advantage programs  as well as other changes to the commercial health insurance marketplace 
most significantly  the mma created a voluntary prescription drug benefit  called part d benefit  for medicare beneficiaries that began in  established a new medicare advantage program to replace the medicare choice program  and enacted tax advantaged health savings accounts  or hsa s  for non medicare eligible individuals and groups 
the part d benefit enables medicare beneficiaries to pay a monthly premium for the covered outpatient drug benefit offered through a private drug plan 
the drug benefit is subject to certain cost sharing 
under the standard drug coverage  for the cost sharing is a deductible  coinsurance for annual drug costs reimbursed by medicare up to a maximum of  and no reimbursement for drug costs above  until the beneficiary has paid  after that  the mma provides catastrophic stop loss coverage for annual incurred drug costs in excess of  subject to nominal cost sharing 
plans are not required to mirror these limits  instead  part d drug plans are required to provide coverage that is at least actuarially equivalent to the standard drug coverage delineated in the mma 
these numbers are adjusted on an annual basis 
the mma provides subsidies and the reduction or elimination of cost sharing for certain low income beneficiaries  including dual eligible individuals who receive benefits under both medicare and medicaid 
the part d benefit is offered by new regional prescription drug plans 
medicare advantage organizations must offer a plan with the part d benefit 
in addition  medicare advantage plans may bid to offer a stand alone prescription drug plan that beneficiaries who have fee for service medicare may elect 
the mma also revised payment methodologies for medicare advantage organizations beginning in  and in the mma expanded the medicare advantage program to include new regional plans which provide out of network benefits in addition to in network benefits  in addition to the traditional hmo and fee for service plans established by county 
the secretary of health and human services  or hhs  created regions  each of which may include more than one state or portions of a particular state 
the mma created a new competitive bidding process that began in for both the local hmo plans and the new regional plans for setting the payment to the medicare advantage plans and the beneficiary premium and benefits 
the bidding process does not limit the number of plans that may participate in the medicare advantage program 
cms conducts audits of plans qualified under its medicare program at least biannually and may perform other reviews more frequently to determine compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations 
these audits include review of the plans administration and management  including management information and data collection systems  fiscal stability  utilization management and physician incentive arrangements  health services delivery  quality assurance  marketing  enrollment and dis enrollment activity  claims processing  and complaint systems 
cms regulations require submission of quarterly and annual financial statements 
in addition  cms requires that certain disclosures be made to them and to medicare beneficiaries concerning operations of a health plan contracted under the medicare program 
cms s rules require disclosure  upon request  to members of information concerning financial arrangements and incentive plans between the plan and physicians in the plan s networks 
these rules also require certain levels of stop loss coverage to protect contracted physicians against major losses relating to patient care  depending on the amount of financial risk they assume 
fraud and abuse laws enforcement of health care fraud and abuse laws has become a top priority for the nation s law enforcement entities 
the funding of such law enforcement efforts has increased dramatically in the past few years and is expected to continue 
the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare 
we participate extensively in these programs and have continued our stringent regulatory compliance efforts for these programs 
the programs are subject to very technical rules 
when combined with law enforcement intolerance for any level of noncompliance  these rules mean that compliance efforts in this area continue to be challenging 
privacy regulations the use of individually identifiable data by our business is regulated at federal and state levels 
these laws and rules are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
various state laws address the use and maintenance of individually identifiable health data 
most are derived from the privacy provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley act and the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
hipaa mandates guaranteed availability and renewability of health insurance for certain employees and individuals  limits on termination options and on the use of preexisting condition exclusions  prohibitions against discriminating on the basis of health status  and requirements which make it easier to continue coverage in cases where an employee is terminated or changes employers 
hipaa also calls for the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information and privacy requirements that govern the handling  use and disclosure of protected customer health information 
we believe that we met the hipaa security rule changes that became effective on april   however hipaa is far reaching and complex and proper interpretation and practice under the law continue to evolve 
consequently  our efforts to measure  monitor and adjust our business practices to comply with hipaa are ongoing 
we do not believe that compliance with hipaa will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
insurance companies also are required to comply with federal do not call regulations 
insurance companies are required to develop their own do not call lists and reference state and federal do not call registries  before making calls to market insurance products 
it is estimated that approximately two thirds of the country s residential telephone numbers are on the federal registry  which could limit the marketing calls made and potentially could negatively impact sales 
usa patriot act a portion of the usa patriot act applying to insurance companies became effective in mid insurance companies have to impose tighter processes and procedures to more thoroughly verify its agents  applicants  insureds  claimants and premium payers in an effort to prevent money laundering 
our insurance companies have implemented measures to comply with the office of federal asset control requirements  whereby the names of customers and potential customers must be reviewed against a listing of known terrorists and money launderers 
the identification verification requirement of the usa patriot act was finalized in late in may  insurance companies will be required to verify the identity of their applicants  insureds  and beneficiaries 
we are establishing internal procedures  securing software and training our home office staff and producers in an effort to comply 
state and local regulation each of our insurance company subsidiaries and our health plan affiliates are also subject to the regulations and supervision by the insurance department of each of the jurisdictions in which they are admitted and authorized to transact business 
such regulations cover  among other things  the declaration and payment of dividends by our insurance company subsidiaries  the setting of rates to be charged for some types of insurance  the granting and revocation of licenses to transact business  the licensing of agents  the regulation and monitoring of market conduct and claims practices  the approval of forms  the establishment of reserve requirements  investment restrictions  the regulation of maximum allowable commission rates  the mandating of some insurance benefits  minimum capital and surplus levels  and the form and accounting practices used to prepare financial statements required by statute 
a failure to comply with legal or regulatory restrictions may subject the insurance company subsidiary to a loss of a right to engage in some or all business in a state or states or an obligation to pay fines or make restitution  which may affect our profitability

our managed care subsidiary operates medicare advantage coordinated care plans in texas  florida and oklahoma and pffs plans in states 
most jurisdictions mandate minimum benefit standards and loss ratios for accident and health insurance policies 
generally we are required to maintain  with respect to our individual long term care policies  minimum anticipated loss ratios over the entire period of coverage 
with respect to our medicare supplement policies  we are generally required to attain and maintain an actual loss ratio  after three years  of not less than percent of earned premium 
we provide  to the insurance departments of all states in which we conduct business  annual calculations that demonstrate compliance with required loss ratio standards for both long term care and medicare supplement insurance 
we prepare these calculations utilizing statutory lapse and interest rate assumptions 
in the event we fail to maintain minimum mandated loss ratios  our insurance company subsidiaries could be required to provide retrospective premium refunds or prospective premium rate reductions 
we believe that our insurance company subsidiaries currently comply with all applicable mandated minimum loss ratios 
in addition  we actively review the loss ratio experience of our products and request approval for rate increases from the respective insurance departments when we determine they are needed 
we cannot guarantee that we will receive the rate increases we request 
under federal and naic model regulations  adopted in substantially all states  there are standard medicare supplement plans plans a through l and high deductible plans f and j 
plan a provides the least extensive coverage  while plan j provides the most extensive coverage 
under naic regulations  medicare supplement insurers must offer plan a  but may offer any of the other plans at their option 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of mma prohibits the sale of the former h  i and j plans and authorizes two additional plans after december plans k and l

as of december   securities totaling million  representing approximately of the carrying value of our total investments  were on deposit with various state treasurers or custodians

provincial insurance regulation is concerned primarily with the form of insurance contracts and the sale and marketing of insurance and annuity products  including the licensing and supervision of insurance marketing personnel 
chcs services inc  our senior administrative entity  is subject to regulation as a third party administrator in those states where it services policyholders 
the primary intention of the regulation is to ensure adequate financial strength to meet the policyholder obligations 
dividend restrictions new york state insurance law provides that the declaration or payment of a dividend by american progressive requires the approval of the new york superintendent of insurance 
management expects that no dividend would be approved until american progressive had generated sufficient statutory profits to offset its negative unassigned surplus 
pennsylvania  kansas and texas insurance laws provide that a life insurer may pay dividends or make distributions from accumulated earnings without the prior approval of the insurance department  provided they do not exceed the greater of i of the insurer s surplus as to policyholders as of the preceding december  or ii the insurer s net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year with days advance notification to the insurance department 
accordingly  pennsylvania life would be able to pay ordinary dividends of up to million to american exchange its direct parent without the prior approval from the pennsylvania insurance department in texas insurance companies also are required to have positive earned surplus as defined by texas regulations  which differs from statutory unassigned surplus  in order to pay dividends without prior regulatory approval 
american exchange  constitution  marquette and union bankers had negative earned surplus at december  and would not be able to pay dividends in without special approval 
selectcare is licensed in texas as a provider sponsored organization pso would also not be able to pay dividends in without special approval 
florida insurance law provides that a life insurer may pay a dividend or make a distribution without the prior written approval of the department when certain conditions are met 
american pioneer had negative unassigned surplus at december  and would not be able to pay dividends in without special approval 
canadian law provides that a life insurer may pay a dividend after such dividend declaration has been approved by its board of directors and upon at least days prior notification to the superintendent of financial institutions 
such a dividend is limited to retained net income based on canadian gaap for the preceding two years  plus net income earned for the current year 
in considering approval of a dividend  the board of directors must consider whether the payment of such dividend would be in contravention of the insurance companies act of canada 
during  penncorp life canada paid dividends of c million approximately us million to universal american 
during  penncorp life canada became subject to a withholding tax on dividends paid to universal american 
the withholding tax paid on the dividends from penncorp life canada in was c million approximately us million 
due to limitations resulting from the timing of prior dividend payments by penncorp life canada  we do not anticipate that penncorp life canada will be able to pay dividends in  without prior approval 
risk based capital and minimum capital requirements risk based capital requirements promulgated in each state take into account asset risks  interest rate risks  mortality and morbidity risks and other relevant risks with respect to the insurer s business and specify varying degrees of regulatory action to occur to the extent that an insurer does not meet the specified risk based capital thresholds  with increasing degrees of regulatory scrutiny or intervention provided for companies in categories of lesser risk based capital compliance 
penncorp life canada  is subject to minimum continuing capital and surplus requirements  which canadian regulators use to assess financial strength and to determine when regulatory intervention is needed 
as of december  all of our us insurance company subsidiaries and managed care affiliates maintained ratios of total adjusted capital to risk based capital in excess of the authorized control level and penncorp life canada maintained minimum continuing capital and surplus requirement ratios in excess of minimum requirements 
however  should our insurance company subsidiaries and managed care affiliates risk based capital position decline in the future  their ability to pay dividends  required capital contributions from universal american and the degree of regulatory supervision or control to which they are subjected might be affected 
guaranty association assessments our insurance company subsidiaries can be required  under solvency or guaranty laws of most jurisdictions in which they do business  to pay assessments to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of unaffiliated insurance companies that become insolvent 
these assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most solvency or guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurer s financial strength and  in most instances  may be offset against future premium taxes 
the insurance company subsidiaries provide for known and expected insolvency assessments based on information provided by the national organization of life health guaranty associations 
our insurance company subsidiaries have not incurred any significant costs of this nature 
the likelihood and amount of any future assessments is unknown and is beyond our control 
producer compensation disclosure state regulators and attorney generals have initiated investigations into producer compensation and product pricing 
while the initial investigations have focused on commercial lines insurers and brokers  it remains to be seen whether the investigations will broaden and potentially change how our products are sold 
we have responded to inquiries regarding our sales practices  and we do not anticipate that our responses will require any change in our compensation practices or any other adverse result 
the naic  at the end of  adopted an amendment to the producer licensing model act the plma which provides that when compensation is received by one of our producers from both the customer and an insurance company  the producer must receive the customer s documented acknowledgement that compensation will be received from the insurance company and must disclose the amount of such compensation to the customer 
such disclosures  however  will not be necessary if the producer does not receive a fee from the customer for the placement of insurance and discloses to the customer that he she is acting on behalf of the insurance company and may provide services to the customer on behalf of the insurance company 
in  arizona  connecticut  georgia  nevada  oregon  rhode island and texas passed producer compensation disclosure legislation or regulations 
some other states may be considering legislation or regulations dealing with producer commission disclosure in it is possible that some states will adopt laws that are broader than the naic model amendment 
annuity suitability in september  the naic adopted the senior protection in annuity transaction model regulation 
states are adopting the model or similar suitable regulations 
the model regulation imposes additional obligations on insurance producers  their supervisors and insurance carriers relating to annuity sales to customers age and over 
the burden of demonstrating suitability of the recommended annuity is that of the producer with oversight responsibilities imposed on the producer s supervisor and the insurer 
we have developed and distributed guidelines to our sales forces to assist in complying with the regulations 
the naic is in the process of revising the model to require producers to demonstrate annuity suitability for all customers 
such regulatory change will have minimal impact on our annuity business since the processes and procedures are in place and our marketing efforts focus on seniors

employees as of february   we employed approximately  employees  none of whom is represented by a labor union in such employment 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
certain material weaknesses management has identified a material weakness in the company s internal control over financial reporting 
a discussion of this material weakness can be found in item a of part ii of this annual report on form k 
management believes that the company has effectively remediated this weakness 
item a risk factors you should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth elsewhere in this form k 
these risks and other factors may affect forward looking statements  including those contained in this k or made by the company elsewhere  such as in investor calls or conference presentations 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
if any of the following risks or uncertainties develops into actual events  this could significantly and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline materially 
risks related to our overall business we have a significant amount of debt outstanding that contains restrictive covenants and we may be unable to service and repay our debt obligations if our subsidiaries cannot pay sufficient dividends or make other cash payments to us 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding under our amended credit agreement and million in trust preferred securities 
we have available borrowing capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility of approximately million 
substantially all of the capital stock of our operating subsidiaries is pledged to our bank lenders 
because our principal outstanding indebtedness has been incurred by our parent company  our ability to make interest and principal payments on our outstanding debt is dependent upon the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or make other cash payments to our parent company 
our subsidiaries will be able to pay dividends to our parent company only if they earn sufficient profits and  in the case of our insurance company and health plan subsidiaries  they satisfy the requirements of the state insurance laws relating to dividend payments and the maintenance of required surplus  to which they are subject 
our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes  including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures 
if our operating cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations  we may be forced to sell assets  seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt 
however  these measures might be unsuccessful or inadequate in permitting us to meet scheduled debt service obligations 
we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 
our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic  regulatory and industry conditions  and placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged  limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  and exposing us to greater interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowings under our senior credit facilities is variable 
capital constraints could restrict our ability to support our premium growth 
our continued growth is dependent upon our ability to support premium revenue growth through the expansion of our markets and our network of agents while at the same time maintaining sufficient levels of capital and surplus to support that growth 
our new business growth typically results in reduced income caused by investment expenses in new market expansion and  on certain insurance products  net losses during the early years of a policy statutory surplus strain 
the resulting reduction in capital and surplus can limit our ability to generate new business due to statutory restrictions on premium to surplus ratios and other required statutory surplus parameters 
in addition  some states  such as florida and texas  limit an insurer s ability to write certain lines of business if gross and or net premiums written would exceed a specified percentage of capital and surplus 
in addition  we are required to maintain adequate risk based capital ratios as prescribed by each state 
moreover  substantially more capital than the statutory minimums are needed to support our level of premium growth and to finance acquisitions 
if we cannot generate sufficient capital and statutory surplus to maintain minimum statutory requirements and support our growth  we could be restricted in our ability to generate new premium revenue 
if we are required to maintain higher statutory capital levels for our existing operations or if we are subject to additional capital reserve requirements as we pursue new business opportunities  our cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected 
our insurance and health plans operations are conducted through subsidiaries in various states 
these subsidiaries are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  or net worth  as defined by each state 
one or more of these states may raise the statutory capital level from time to time 
other states have adopted risk based capital requirements based on guidelines adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners  which tend to be  although are not necessarily  higher than existing statutory capital requirements 
regardless of whether the other states in which we operate adopt risk based capital requirements  the state departments of insurance can require our subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital in excess of amounts required under the applicable state laws if they determine that maintaining additional statutory capital is in the best interests of our members 
any increases in these requirements could materially increase our reserve requirements 
in addition  as we continue to expand our plan offerings in new states or pursue new business opportunities  including our recent offerings of pdp s and expansion of private fee for service products and health plans in new markets  we may be required to maintain additional statutory capital reserves 
in either case  our available funds could be materially reduced  which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy 
if state regulators do not approve payments  including dividends and other distributions  by our subsidiaries to us  our business and growth strategy could be materially impaired or we could be required to incur additional indebtedness to fund these strategies 
our health plan and insurance company subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions they can pay to us for purposes other than to pay income taxes related to their earnings 
these laws and regulations also limit the amount of management fees our subsidiaries may pay to their affiliates  including our management subsidiaries  without prior approval of  or notification to  state regulators 
the pre approval and notice requirements vary from state to state with some states  such as texas  generally allowing  subject to advance notice requirements  dividends to be declared  provided the subsidiary meets or exceeds the applicable deposit  net worth  and risk based capital requirements 
the discretion of the state regulators  if any  in approving or disapproving a dividend is not always clearly defined 
subsidiaries that declare non extraordinary dividends must usually provide notice to the regulators in advance of the intended distribution date 
if the regulators were to deny or significantly restrict our subsidiaries requests to pay dividends to us or to pay management and other fees to the affiliates of our subsidiaries  the funds available to us would be limited  which could impair our ability to implement our business and growth strategy and satisfy our debt obligations or we could be required to incur additional indebtedness to fund these strategies 
we hold reserves for expected claims  which are estimated  and these estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment  if actual claims exceed reserve estimates  our results could be materially adversely affected 
our benefits incurred expense includes estimates of claims incurred but not reported  or ibnr 
we  together with our internal and consulting actuaries  estimate our claim liabilities using actuarial methods based on historical data adjusted for payment patterns  cost trends  product mix  seasonality  utilization of healthcare services and other relevant factors 
actual conditions  however  could differ from those assumed in the estimation process 
due to the uncertainties associated with the factors used in these assumptions  the actual amount of benefit expense that we incur may be materially more or less than the amount of ibnr originally estimated  and materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements for a particular period under different conditions or using different assumptions 
adjustments  if necessary  are made to benefits incurred expense when the criteria used to determine ibnr change and when actual claim costs are ultimately determined 
if our estimates of ibnr are inadequate in the future  our reported results of operations will be negatively impacted 
further  our inability to estimate ibnr accurately may also affect our ability to take timely corrective actions or otherwise establish appropriate premium pricing  further exacerbating the extent of any adverse effect on our results 
our financial strength rating is lower than several distributors minimum acceptable rating and could affect our competitiveness and results of operations 
increased public and regulatory concerns regarding the financial stability of insurance companies and health plans have resulted in consumers placing greater emphasis upon financial strength ratings and have created some measure of competitive advantage for insurance companies and health plans with higher ratings 
our ability to expand and to attract new business is affected by the financial strength ratings assigned to our subsidiaries by independent industry rating agencies  such as am best company  inc some distributors such as financial institutions  unions  associations and affinity groups may not sell our products to these groups unless the rating of our subsidiary writing the business improves to at least an a from their current b 
the lack of higher am best ratings for our subsidiaries could adversely affect sales of our products 
in addition  any future downgrade in our ratings may cause our policyholders and members to lapse 
increased lapse rates would reduce our premium revenue and net income 
any future downgrade in our ratings could also cause some of our agents to sell less of our products or to cease selling our policies altogether 
failure to maintain our information systems could adversely affect our business 
our business depends significantly on efficient  effective and secure information systems 
we have various information systems which support our operating segments 
the information gathered and processed by our management information systems assists us in  among other things  marketing and sales tracking  underwriting  billing  claims processing  medical management  medical care cost and utilization trending  financial and management accounting  reporting  planning and analysis and e commerce 
these systems also support on line customer service functions  provider and member administrative functions and support tracking and extensive analyses of medical expenses and outcome data 
these information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs and handle our expansion and growth 
any inability or failure to properly maintain management information systems  successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs in a timely manner  could result in operational disruptions  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers or in implementing our growth strategies  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory problems  increases in administrative expenses  loss of our ability to produce timely and accurate reports and other adverse consequences 
to the extent a failure in maintaining effective information systems occurs  we may need to contract for these services with third party management companies  which may be on less favorable terms to us and significantly disrupt our operations and information flow 
furthermore  our business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
because of the confidential health information we store and transmit  security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action  litigation  possible liability and loss 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches  and our business operations and profitability would be adversely affected by cancellation of contracts  loss of members and potential criminal and civil sanctions if they are not prevented 
we have outsourced the operation of our data center to independent third parties and may from time to time obtain additional services or facilities from other independent third parties 
dependence on third parties for these services and facilities may make our operations vulnerable to their failure to perform as agreed 
we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates 
part of our business strategy is to make acquisitions that will be accretive to income and will advance our strategic mission 
we continue to evaluate possible acquisition transactions on an ongoing basis  and at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and close the transactions 
factors that might preclude closing transactions include the inability to reach a definitive agreement with the seller  the inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms  and the discovery of material issues with the acquisition candidate as a result of our due diligence investigation 
if we cannot find suitable acquisition candidates or are not successful in completing acquisitions  we may not be able to sustain our recent historical growth rates 
there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in managing our growing operations or in integrating acquired companies into our operations 
the rapid growth in the size and complexity of our operations has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on our management  operations systems  accounting systems  internal controls systems and financial resources 
acquisition risk as part of our strategy  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  considerable growth through acquisitions 
acquisitions involve numerous additional risks  some of which we have experienced in the past  including difficulties in integrating operations  technologies  products  systems and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations  potential increases in policy lapses  potential losses from unanticipated litigation or levels of claims  and inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs 
in addition  we generally are required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions  which may require a public hearing  regardless of whether we already operate a plan in the state in which the business to be acquired is located 
we may be unable to comply with these regulatory requirements for an acquisition in a timely manner  or at all 
moreover  some sellers may insist on selling assets that we may not want  including commercial lines of business  or transferring their liabilities to us as part of the sale of their companies or assets 
even if we identify suitable acquisition targets  we may be unable to complete acquisitions or obtain the necessary financing for these acquisitions on terms favorable to us  or at all 
to the extent we complete an acquisition  we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from it because of operational factors or difficulties in integrating the acquisitions with our existing businesses 
this may include the integration of additional employees who are not familiar with our operations  new provider networks  which may operate on terms different from our existing networks  additional members  who may decide to transfer to other healthcare providers or health plans  disparate information technology  claims processing  and record keeping systems  and accounting policies  including those that require a high degree of judgment or complex estimation processes  including estimates of ibnr claims  valuation and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  stock based compensation  and income tax matters 
for all of the above reasons  we may not be able to successfully implement our acquisition strategy 
furthermore  in the event of an acquisition or investment  you should be aware that we may issue stock that would dilute stock ownership  incur debt that would restrict our cash flow  assume liabilities  incur large and immediate write offs  incur unanticipated costs  divert management s attention from our existing business  experience risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  or lose key employees from the acquired entities 
internal growth and expansion risk additionally  we are likely to incur additional costs if we develop new product offerings or enter new service areas or states where we do not currently operate  which may limit our ability to expand to  or further expand in  those areas 
our rate of expansion into new geographic areas may also be limited by the time and costs associated with designing and filing new product forms and recruiting related sales forces to offer in the new area  the time and costs associated with obtaining an hmo license to operate in the new area or expanding our licensed service area  as the case may be  our inability to develop a network of physicians  hospitals  and other healthcare providers that meets our requirements and those of the applicable regulators  competition  which could increase the costs of recruiting members  reduce the pool of available members  or increase the cost of attracting and maintaining our providers  the cost of providing healthcare services in those areas  and demographics and population density 
our ability to manage our growth and compete effectively will depend  in part  on our success in addressing these demands and risks 
any failure by us to effectively manage our growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
most of our assets are invested in fixed income securities and are subject to market fluctuations 
our investment portfolio consists almost entirely of fixed income securities 
the fair market value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions 
the fair market value of our investments in fixed income securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed income securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
in addition  actual net investment income and or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk such as mortgage backed and other asset backed securities may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations 
because substantially all of our fixed income securities are classified as available for sale  changes in the market value of our securities are reflected in our balance sheet 
similar treatment is not available for liabilities 
therefore  interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
compliance with recently enacted laws and regulations is complex and expensive 
several laws and regulations adopted by the federal government including sarbanes oxley  the gramm leach bliley act  hipaa  the usa patriot act  and do not call regulations  have created additional administrative and compliance requirements on us 
the requirements of these laws and regulations are still evolving  and the cost of compliance may have an adverse effect on our profitability 
in addition  if we do not comply adequately  we may be faced with administrative penalties 
we are required to comply with laws governing the transmission  security and privacy of health information that require significant compliance costs  and any failure to comply with these laws could result in material criminal and civil penalties 
regulations under hipaa require us to comply with standards regarding the exchange of health information within our company and with third parties  including healthcare providers  business associates and our members 
these regulations include standards for common healthcare transactions  including claims information  plan eligibility  and payment information  unique identifiers for providers and employers  security  privacy  and enforcement 
hipaa also provides that to the extent that state laws impose stricter privacy standards than hipaa privacy regulations  such state standards and laws are not preempted by hipaa 
we will conduct our operations in an attempt to comply with all applicable hipaa requirements 
given the complexity of the hipaa regulations  the possibility that the regulations may change  and the fact that the regulations are subject to changing and  at times  conflicting interpretation  our ongoing ability to comply with the hipaa requirements is uncertain 
furthermore  a state s ability to promulgate stricter laws  and uncertainty regarding many aspects of such state requirements  make compliance more difficult 
to the extent that we submit electronic healthcare claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under hipaa  payments to us may be delayed or denied 
additionally  the costs of complying with any changes to the hipaa regulations may have a negative impact on our operations 
sanctions for failing to comply with the hipaa health information provisions include criminal penalties and civil sanctions  including significant monetary penalties 
in addition  our failure to comply with state health information laws that may be more restrictive than the regulations issued under hipaa could result in additional penalties 
we are subject to extensive government regulation  and any violation of the laws and regulations applicable to us could reduce our revenues and profitability and otherwise adversely affect our operating results 
our health plans and insurance companies are extensively regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate 
the laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect policyholders  health plan members and providers rather than stockholders 
the government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude to enforce them 
these laws and regulations  along with the terms of our government contracts  regulate how we do business  what services we offer  and how we interact with our policyholders  members  providers and the public 
healthcare laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and differing interpretations 
changes in existing laws or regulations  or their interpretations  or the enactment of new laws or the issuance of new regulations could adversely affect our business by  among other things imposing additional license  registration  or capital reserve requirements  increasing our administrative and other costs  forcing us to undergo a corporate restructuring  increasing mandated benefits without corresponding premium increases  limiting our ability to engage in inter company transactions with our affiliates and subsidiaries  effecting our ability to operate under the medicare program and to continue to serve our members and attract new members  forcing us to restructure our relationships with providers and agents  or requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems 
in addition  we are subject  on an ongoing basis  to various governmental reviews  audits and investigations to verify our compliance with our contracts and applicable laws and regulations 
any adverse review  audit or investigation could result in forfeiture of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts  imposition of civil or criminal penalties  fines or other sanctions on us  loss of our right to participate in government sponsored programs  including medicare  damage to our reputation in various markets  increased difficulty in marketing our products and services  and loss of one or more of our licenses to act as an insurer or health maintenance organization or to otherwise provide a service 
any of these events could reduce our revenues and profitability and otherwise adversely affect our operating results 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of made changes to the medicare program that will materially impact our operations and could reduce our profitability and increase competition for existing and prospective members 
the mma substantially changed the medicare program and will modify how we operate our business 
although many of these changes are designed to benefit medicare advantage plans generally  certain provisions of the mma may increase competition  create challenges for us with respect to educating our existing and potential members about the changes  and create other risks and substantial and potentially adverse uncertainties  including the following increased competition could adversely affect our enrollment and results of operations the mma increased reimbursement rates for medicare advantage plans 
higher reimbursement rates may increase the number of plans that participate in the medicare program  creating new competition that could adversely affect our profitability and cause increased lapsation in our medicare supplement in force as policyholders choose to enroll in a competitors plan 
as of  a new regional medicare preferred provider organization  or medicare ppo  program and private fee for service plans were implemented pursuant to the mma 
medicare ppo s and private fee for service plans allow their members more flexibility to select physicians than the current plans  which are hmos that require members to coordinate with a primary care physician 
the regional medicare ppo program and private fee for service plans will compete with local medicare advantage programs and may affect our medicare advantage business 
we do not know how the creation of the regional medicare ppo program and private fee for service plans  which are intended to provide further choice to beneficiaries  will affect our medicare advantage hmo business 
the new competitive bidding process may adversely affect our profitability as of january   the payments for the local medicare advantage hmo and regional medicare advantage ppo programs are based on a competitive bidding process that may decrease the amount of premiums paid to us or cause us to increase the benefits we offer 
the new limited annual enrollment process may adversely affect our growth and ability to market our products beginning in  medicare beneficiaries generally have a more limited annual enrollment period during which they can choose to participate in a medicare advantage plan or receive benefits under the traditional fee for service medicare program 
after the annual enrollment period  most medicare beneficiaries will not be permitted to change their medicare benefits 
the new annual enrollment process and subsequent lock in provisions of the mma may adversely affect our growth as it will limit our ability to enter new service areas and market to or enroll new members in our established service areas outside of the annual enrollment period 
the limited annual enrollment period may make it difficult to retain an adequate sales force as a result of the limited annual enrollment period and the subsequent lock in provisions of the mma  our sales force  including our independent sales brokers and agents  may be limited in their ability to market our products year round 
our agents rely substantially on sales commissions for their income 
given the limited annual sales window  it may become more difficult to find agents to market and promote our products 
we may be unable to provide the new medicare part d benefit profitably see also risks related to our prescription drug plan business beginning in  organizations that offer medicare advantage plans of the type we currently offer are required to offer a prescription drug benefit  as defined by medicare  and medicare advantage enrollees will be required to obtain their drug benefit from their medicare advantage plan 
such combined managed care plans offering drug benefits are  under the new law  called ma pd s 
it is not known at this time whether the governmental payments will be adequate to cover the actual costs for this benefit 
current enrollees may prefer a stand alone drug plan and may dis enroll from the medicare advantage plan altogether in order to participate in another drug plan 
accordingly  the new prescription drug benefit could reduce our profitability and membership enrollment 
some enrollees may have chosen our medicare advantage plan in the past rather than a medicare fee for service program because of the added drug benefit that we offer with our medicare advantage plans 
as of january   medicare beneficiaries have the opportunity to obtain a drug benefit without joining a managed care plan 
we do not know at this time whether our pdp or ma pd benefits will be as or more attractive than those of our competitors 
additionally  medicare beneficiaries that participate in a medicare advantage plan that enroll in a pdp will be automatically dis enrolled from their medicare advantage plan 
accordingly  the existence of new pdp s in our service areas could result in our members intentionally or inadvertently dis enrolling from our plans and reduce our membership and profitability 
we began marketing our ma pd s and pdp s in october and began enrolling members  effective as of january   on november  our ability to profitably operate our ma pd s and pdp s will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to attract members  to develop the necessary core systems and processes and to manage our medical expense related to these plans 
because required prescription drug benefits are new to medicare and to the health insurance market generally  there is significant uncertainty of the ultimate market size  consumer demand  and related medical loss ratio 
accordingly  we do not know whether we will be able to operate our ma pd s or pdp s profitably or competitively  and our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
the mma provides for risk corridors that are expected to limit to some extent the losses ma pd s or pdp s would incur if their costs turned out to be higher than those in the per member per month  or pmpm  bids submitted to cms in excess of certain specified ranges 
for example  for and drug plans will bear all gains and losses up to of their expected costs  but will be reimbursed for of the losses between and  and of losses in excess of 
it is anticipated that the initial risk corridors in and will provide more protection against excess losses than will be available beginning in and future years as the thresholds increase and the reimbursement percentages decrease 
in addition  we expect there will be a delay in obtaining reimbursement from cms for reimbursable losses pursuant to the risk corridors 
for example  if we incur reimbursable losses in  we would not be reimbursed by cms until in that event  we expect there would be a negative impact on our cash flows and financial condition as a result of being required to finance excess losses until we are reimbursed 
in addition  as the risk corridors are designed to be symmetrical  a plan whose actual costs fall below their expected costs would be required to reimburse cms based on a similar methodology as set forth above 
furthermore  reconciliation payments for estimated upfront federal reinsurance payments  or  in some cases  the entire amount of the reinsurance payments  for medicare beneficiaries who reach the drug benefit s catastrophic threshold are made retroactively on an annual basis  which could expose plans to upfront costs in providing the benefit 
accordingly  it may be difficult to accurately predict or report the operating results associated with our drug benefits 
we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  and our business and stock price may be adversely affected if we have not adequately addressed the weakness or if we have other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting 
we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december   relating to the accounting for our medicare supplement claim reserves and amounts recoverable from reinsurers 
specifically  our analysis and review controls were not sufficient to ensure that our estimated claims reserves  amounts recoverable from reinsurers and net incurred claims for our medicare supplement business were appropriately stated 
as a result of this weakness  our internal controls did not detect the need for adjustments to the amounts initially recorded for these items 
based on additional analysis and procedures performed  management made adjustments in the fourth quarter of to our claim reserves and amounts recoverable from reinsurers as of december  and the related incurred claims expense for the year ended december  for our medicare supplement business prior to the issuance of the consolidated financial statements as of december  the existence of one or more material weaknesses or significant deficiencies could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements  and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify any internal control deficiencies 
if we cannot produce reliable financial reports  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  the market price of our stock could decline significantly  we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business  and our business and financial condition could be harmed 
restrictions on our ability to market would adversely affect our revenue 
we rely on our marketing and sales efforts for a significant portion of our premium revenue growth 
the federal and state governments in which we currently operate permit marketing but impose strict requirements and limitations as to the types of marketing activities that are permitted 
if our marketing efforts were to be prohibited or curtailed  our ability to increase or sustain membership would be significantly harmed  which would adversely affect our revenue 
we may be responsible for the actions of our independent and career agents 
in litigation against our subsidiaries  claims are sometimes made that agents failed to comply with applicable laws  regulations and rules  or acted improperly in other ways and that we are responsible for such failure 
although we require our agents to comply with applicable laws  regulations  and our rules and standards  and maintain monitoring and supervisory procedures to enforce this requirement  we may be held liable for contractual or extra contractual damages on such claims 
we cannot assure you that any future claim will not result in material liability in the future 
legal and regulatory investigations and actions are increasingly common in the insurance and managed care business and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation 
we face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses  including the risk of class action lawsuits 
our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate 
in our insurance and health plan operations  we are or may become subject to class actions and individual suits alleging  among other things  issues relating to sales or underwriting practices  alleged agent misconduct  discrimination  claims payments and procedures  product design  disclosure  administration  additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis  denial or delay of benefits and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers 
plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts  including punitive and treble damages  which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
we are also subject to various regulatory inquiries  such as information requests  subpoenas and books and record examinations  from state  federal and international regulators and other authorities 
a substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we  and certain of our officers and directors  currently are party to a number of lawsuits  including purported class actions and derivative claims 
these actions generally relate to allegedly false statements about our medical loss ratio and allege various violations of law 
these cases currently seek unspecified damages 
we also may be subject to additional litigation in the future 
litigation could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations because of the costs of defending these cases  the costs of settlement or judgments against us  or the changes in our operations that could result from litigation 
the defense of any such actions may be time consuming and costly  and may distract our management s attention 
in addition  we could suffer significant harm to our reputation  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business 
please see item legal proceedings for more information about litigation against us 
we maintain errors and omissions insurance and other insurance coverage that we believe are adequate based on industry standards 
potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance or indemnity  our insurers or indemnifying parties may dispute coverage or may be unable to meet their obligations or the amount of our insurance or indemnification coverage may be inadequate 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future  or that insurance will continue to be available on a cost effective basis  if at all 
the occurrence of natural or man made disasters could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 
we are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters  including earthquakes  hurricanes  floods and tornadoes  and pandemic health events such as avian influenza  as well as man made disasters  including acts of terrorism and military actions 
for example  a natural or man made disaster could lead to unexpected changes in persistency rates as policyholders and contractholders who are affected by the disaster may be unable to meet their contractual obligations  such as payment of premiums on our insurance policies 
the continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets  and a natural or man made disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster 
these consequences could  among other things  result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas 
disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure  including communications and financial services  which could disrupt our normal business operations 
a natural or man made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us 
in addition  a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio if it affects companies ability to pay principal or interest on their securities 
our business may suffer if we are not able to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if we lose our key personnel 
our future success depends partly on the continued contribution of our senior management and other key employees 
while we currently have employment agreements with certain key executives 
these do not guarantee that the services of these executives will continue to be available to us 
the loss of the services of any of our senior management  or other key employees  could harm our business 
in addition  recruiting and retaining the personnel we require to effectively compete in our markets may be difficult 
if we fail to hire and retain qualified employees  we may not be able to maintain and expand our business 
risks related to our medicare advantage business if our government contracts are not renewed or are terminated  our business could be substantially impaired 
we provide our medicare and other services through a limited number of contracts with federal government agencies 
these contracts generally have terms of one or two years and are subject to nonrenewal by the applicable agency 
all of our government contracts are terminable for cause if we breach a material provision of the contract or violate relevant laws or regulations 
in addition  our right to add new members may be suspended by a government agency if it finds deficiencies in our provider network or operations 
if we are unable to renew  or to successfully rebid or compete for any of our government contracts  or if any of our contracts are terminated  our business could be substantially impaired 
if any of those circumstances were to occur  we would likely pursue one or more alternatives  including seeking to enter into contracts in other geographic markets  seeking to enter into contracts for other services in our existing markets  or seeking to acquire other businesses with existing government contracts 
if we were unable to do so  we could be forced to cease conducting business 
in any such event  our revenues and profits would decrease materially 
because our medicare advantage premiums  which generate most of our medicare advantage revenues  are fixed by contract  we are unable to increase our medicare advantage premiums during the contract term if our corresponding medical benefits expense exceeds our estimates 
most of our medicare advantage revenues are generated by premiums consisting of fixed monthly payments per member 
these payments are fixed on an annual basis by contract  and we are obligated during the contract period  which is generally one or two years  to provide or arrange for the provision of healthcare services as established by the federal government 
if our medical expenses exceed our estimates  except in very limited circumstances or as a result of risk score adjustments for member acuity  we will be unable to increase the premiums we receive under these contracts during the then current terms 
as a result  our profitability depends  to a significant degree  on our ability to adequately predict and effectively manage our medical expenses related to the provision of healthcare services 
relatively small changes in our medical loss ratio  or mlr  can create significant changes in our financial results 
accordingly  the failure to adequately predict and control medical expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported  or ibnr  claims  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
historically  our medical expenses as a percentage of premium revenue have fluctuated 
factors that may cause medical expenses to exceed our estimates include an increase in the cost of healthcare services and supplies  including pharmaceuticals  whether as a result of inflation or otherwise  higher than expected utilization of healthcare services  periodic renegotiation of hospital  physician  and other provider contracts  changes in the demographics of our members and medical trends affecting them  new mandated benefits or other changes in healthcare laws  regulations  and practices  new treatments and technologies  consolidation of physician  hospital  and other provider groups  contractual disputes with providers  hospitals  or other service providers  and the occurrence of catastrophes  major epidemics  or acts of terrorism 
because of the relatively high average age of the medicare population  medical expenses for our medicare advantage plans may be particularly difficult to control 
we attempt to control these costs through a variety of techniques  including capitation and other risk sharing payment methods  collaborative relationships with primary care physicians and other providers  advance approval for hospital services and referral requirements  case and disease management and quality assurance programs  information systems and reinsurance 
despite our efforts and programs to manage our medical expenses  we may not be able to continue to manage these expenses effectively in the future 
if our medical expenses increase  our profits could be reduced or we may not remain profitable 
we derive a substantial portion of our medicare advantage revenues and profits from medicare advantage operations in texas  and legislative actions  economic conditions or other factors that adversely affect those operations could materially reduce our revenues and profits 
if we are unable to continue to operate in texas  or if our current operations in any portion of texas are significantly curtailed  our revenues will decrease materially 
our reliance on our operations in texas could cause our revenues and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly  depending on legislative actions  economic conditions and similar factors 
in addition  our market share in texas may make it more difficult for us to expand our membership in existing markets in texas 
our inability to continue to operate in texas  or a decrease in the revenues of our texas operations  would harm our overall operating results 
cms s risk adjustment payment system and budget neutrality factors make our revenue and profitability difficult to predict and could result in material retroactive adjustments to our results of operations 
all of the medicare advantage programs we offer are through medicare 
as a result  our profitability is dependent  in large part  on continued funding for government healthcare programs at or above current levels 
the premium rates paid to health plans like ours by the federal government are established by contract  although the rates differ depending on a combination of factors such as a member s health status  age  gender  county or region  benefit mix  member eligibility categories  and the plans risk scores 
cms has implemented a risk adjustment payment system for medicare health plans to improve the accuracy of payments and establish incentives for medicare plans to enroll and treat less healthy medicare beneficiaries 
cms is phasing in this payment methodology with a risk adjustment model that bases a portion of the total cms reimbursement payments on various clinical and demographic factors including hospital inpatient diagnoses  diagnosis data from ambulatory treatment settings  including hospital outpatient facilities and physician visits  gender  age  and medicaid eligibility 
cms requires that all managed care companies capture  collect  and submit the necessary diagnosis code information to cms twice a year for reconciliation with cms s internal database 
as part of the phase in  during  risk adjusted payments accounted for of medicare health plan payments  with the remaining being reimbursed in accordance with the traditional cms demographic rate books 
the portion of risk adjusted payments was increased to in  and will increase to in as a result of this process  it is difficult to predict with certainty our future revenue or profitability 
in addition  our own risk scores for any period may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the payments we receive from cms and our medicare premium revenue 
there can be no assurance that our contracting physicians and hospitals will be successful in improving the accuracy of recording diagnosis code information and thereby enhancing our risk scores 
payments to medicare advantage plans are also adjusted by a budget neutrality to prevent health plan payments from being reduced overall while  at the same time  directing higher risk adjusted payments to those plans with more chronically ill enrollees 
in general  this adjustment has favorably impacted payments to all medicare advantage plans 
the president s budget issued in february assumed a phase out of the budget neutrality adjustments over a five year period from through on february   the president signed the deficit reduction act of  which is estimated to reduce the growth in medicare advantage spending by more than billion over the next five years 
among other changes  the legislation provided for a phase out of budget neutrality for risk adjustment of payments made to medicare advantage plans 
these legislative changes will have the effect of reducing payments to medicare advantage plans in general 
consequently  our plans premiums will be reduced unless our risk scores increase 
we cannot assure you that our risk scores will increase in the future or  if they do  that they will be large enough to offset the elimination of this adjustment 
if we are unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with our providers  our profitability could decline and we may be precluded from operating in some markets 
our operations and profitability depend  in large part  upon our ability to enter into cost effective contracts with hospitals  physicians and other healthcare providers in appropriate numbers in our geographic markets and at convenient locations for our members 
in any particular market  however  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher healthcare costs  disruption of benefits to our members  or difficulty in meeting our regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or near monopolies 
if such a provider or any of our other providers refuse to contract with us  use their market position to negotiate contracts that might not be cost effective or otherwise place us at a competitive disadvantage  then our ability to market products or to be profitable in those service areas could be materially adversely affected 
our provider networks could also be materially disrupted by the financial insolvency of a large provider group 
any disruption in our provider network could result in a loss of membership or higher healthcare costs 
in the long term  our ability to contract successfully with a sufficiently large number of providers in a particular geographic market will affect the relative attractiveness of our managed care products in that market and could preclude us from renewing our medicare contracts in those markets or from entering into new markets 
we will be required to establish acceptable provider networks prior to entering new markets 
although we have established long term relationships with many of our network providers  we may be unable to maintain those relationships or enter into agreements with providers in new markets on a timely basis or under favorable terms 
if we are unable to retain our current provider contracts or to enter into new provider contracts timely or on favorable terms  our profitability could decline 
we may not have adequate intellectual property rights in our brand names for our health plans  and we may be unable to adequately enforce such rights 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to market our health plans under our brand names  including our texan plus family of products 
while we hold federal trademark registrations for the texan plus trademark  we have not taken enforcement action to prevent infringement of our federal trademark and have not secured registrations of our other marks 
other businesses may have prior rights in the brand names that we market under or in similar names  which could limit or prevent our ability to use these marks  or to prevent others from using similar marks 
if we are unable to prevent others from using our brand names  or if others prohibit us from using them  our revenues could be adversely affected 
even if we are able to protect our intellectual property rights in such brands  we could incur significant costs in doing so 
we are subject to competition that may limit our ability to increase or maintain membership in the markets we serve 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is currently subject to significant changes due to business consolidations  new strategic alliances and aggressive marketing practices by other managed care organizations 
we compete for members principally on the basis of size  location and quality of provider network  benefits provided  quality of service and reputation 
a number of these competitive elements are partially dependent upon and can be positively affected by financial resources available to a health plan 
many other organizations with which we compete have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
our failure to maintain or attract members to our health plans could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  changes resulting from the mma may bring additional competitors into our market area 
as a result  we may be unable to increase or maintain our membership 
claims relating to medical malpractice and other litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses 
our providers involved in medical care decisions may be exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims 
a small percentage of these providers do not have malpractice insurance 
as a result of increased costs or inability to secure malpractice insurance  the percentage of physicians who do not have malpractice insurance may increase 
although our network providers are independent contractors  claimants sometimes allege that a managed care organization should be held responsible for alleged provider malpractice  particularly where the provider does not have malpractice insurance  and some courts have permitted that theory of liability 
in addition  managed care organizations may be sued directly for alleged negligence  such as in connection with the credentialing of network providers or for improper denials or delay of care 
in addition  congress and several states are considering legislation that would expressly permit managed care organizations to be held liable for negligent treatment decisions or benefits coverage determinations 
negative publicity regarding the managed care industry generally or us in particular may harm our business and operating results 
negative publicity regarding the managed healthcare industry generally or us in particular may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices that further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations by requiring us to change our products and services  increasing the regulatory burdens under which we operate  adversely affecting our ability to market our products or services  or adversely affecting our ability to attract and retain members 
risks related to our insurance business our net income may decline if our premium rates are not adequate 
we set the premium rates on our insurance policies based on facts and circumstances known at the time we issue the policies and on assumptions about numerous variables  including the actuarial probability of a policyholder incurring a claim  the severity and duration of the claim  the mortality rate of our policyholder base  the persistency or renewal rate of our policies in force  our commission and policy administration expenses  and the interest rate earned on our investment of premiums 
in setting premium rates  we consider historical claims information  industry statistics and other factors 
if our actual claims experience proves to be less favorable than we assumed and we are unable to raise our premium rates  our net income may decrease 
we generally cannot raise our premiums in any state unless we first obtain the approval of the insurance regulator in that state 
we review the adequacy of our accident health premium rates regularly and file rate increases on our products when we believe permitted premium rates are too low 
when determining whether to approve or disapprove our rate increase filings  the various state insurance departments take into consideration our actual claims experience compared to expected claims experience  policy persistency which means the percentage of policies that are in force at certain intervals from the issue date compared to the total amount originally issued  investment income and medical cost inflation 
if the regulators do not believe these factors warrant a rate increase  it is possible that we will not be able to obtain approval for premium rate increases from currently pending requests or requests filed in the future 
if we are unable to raise our premium rates because we fail to obtain approval for rate increases in one or more states  our net income may decrease 
if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval to raise premium rates  the increased premium rates may reduce the volume of our new sales and cause existing policyholders to let their policies lapse 
this would reduce our premium income in future periods 
increased lapse rates also could require us to expense all or a portion of the deferred policy costs relating to lapsed policies in the period in which those policies lapse  reducing our net income in that period 
our reserves for future policy benefits and claims may prove to be inadequate  requiring us to increase liabilities and resulting in reduced net income and shareholders equity 
we calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders using the same actuarial assumptions that we use to set our premiums 
for our accident and health insurance business  we establish active life reserves for expected future policy benefits including for certain of our policies  provisions for return of premiums rop  plus a liability for due and unpaid claims  claims in the course of settlement  and incurred but not reported claims 
many factors can affect these reserves and liabilities  such as economic and social conditions  taxability of rop benefits  inflation  hospital and medical costs  changes in doctrines of legal liability and extra contractual damage awards 
therefore  the reserves and liabilities we establish are necessarily based on extensive estimates  assumptions and prior years statistics 
when we acquire other insurance companies or blocks of insurance  our assessment of the adequacy of acquired policy liabilities is subject to similar estimates and assumptions 
establishing reserves involves inherent uncertainties  and it is possible that actual claims could materially exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our net income depends significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in setting our reserves and pricing our policies 
if our assumptions with respect to future claims are incorrect  and our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and expenses  we would be required to increase our liabilities resulting in reduced net income  statutory surplus and shareholders equity 
the availability of reinsurance on acceptable terms and the financial stability of our reinsurers could impact our ability to manage risk and increase the volume of insurance that we sell 
we utilize reinsurance agreements with larger  financially sound reinsurers to mitigate insurance risks that we underwrite 
we enter into reinsurance arrangements with unaffiliated reinsurance companies to limit our exposure on individual claims and to limit or eliminate risk on our non core or under performing blocks of business 
as of december   we ceded to reinsurers approximately of our gross annualized insurance premium in force 
reinsurance arrangements leave us exposed to two risks credit risk and replacement risk 
credit risk exists because reinsurance does not relieve us of our liability to our insureds for the portion of the risks ceded to reinsurers 
we are exposed to the risk of a reinsurer s failure to pay in full and in a timely manner the claims we make against them in accordance with the terms of our reinsurance agreements  which could expose our insurance company subsidiaries to liabilities in excess of their reserves and surplus and could expose them to insolvency proceedings 
the failure of a reinsurer to make claims payments to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make payments to our policyholders 
replacement risk exists because a reinsurer may cancel its participation on new business issued on advance notice 
as a result  we would need to find reinsurance from another source to support our level of new business 
the amount and cost of reinsurance available to us is subject  in large part  to prevailing market conditions beyond our control 
because our current reinsurance agreements are non cancelable for business in force  non renewal or cancellation of a reinsurance arrangement affects only new business and the reinsurer remains liable on business reinsured prior to non renewal or cancellation 
in the event that current reinsurers cancel their participation on new business  we would seek to replace them  possibly at higher rates 
if we are not able to reinsure our life insurance products on acceptable terms  we would consider limiting the amount of such new business issued 
a failure to obtain reinsurance on acceptable terms would allow us to underwrite new business only to the extent that we are willing and able to bear the exposure to the new business on our own 
changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar may impact our results 
we publish our consolidated financial statements in us dollars 
however  portions of our operations are transacted using the canadian dollar as the functional currency 
as of and for the year ended december   approximately of our assets  of our revenues  excluding realized gains  and of our income before realized gains and taxes were derived from our canadian operations 
accordingly  our earnings and shareholders equity are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to the canadian dollar 
although this risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that both the assets and liabilities for our canadian operations are denominated in canadian dollars  we are still subject to losses resulting from currency translation that will impact our reported consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows from year to year 
we may experience future lapsation in our medicare supplement business 
we experienced higher than expected lapsation in our medicare supplement business beginning in the third quarter of we believe that there are a number of factors contributing to the lapsation  including competitive pressure from other medicare supplement companies and medicare advantage products  as well as the departure of certain of our sales managers 
this excess lapsation required us to accelerate the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost and present value of future profits assets associated with the business that lapsed 
we cannot give assurances that lapsation of our medicare supplement business will decline from the level  requiring faster amortization of the deferred costs 
we may experience higher than expected loss ratios in our medicare supplement business 
during  we experienced a higher than expected loss ratio on our medicare supplement business 
as a result of higher than anticipated part b costs outpatient doctor costs and skilled nursing facility incidence  we did not see our historical pattern of seasonal reduction in loss ratios in the latter part of the year 
we are actively obtaining appropriate rate action in an effort to reverse the trend in these numbers  however  we can make no assurances that future rate increases will be obtained  or if obtained  will be sufficient 
we also cannot give assurance that our medicare supplement loss ratio will not continue to increase beyond what we currently anticipate 
we may not be able to compete successfully if we cannot recruit and retain insurance agents 
we distribute our products principally through career agents and independent agents who we recruit and train to market and sell our products 
we also engage managing general agents from time to time to recruit agents and develop networks of agents in various states 
we compete with other insurance companies for productive agents  primarily on the basis of our financial position  support services  compensation and product features 
it can be difficult to successfully compete with larger insurance companies that have higher financial strength ratings than we do for productive agents 
our business and ability to compete will suffer if we are unable to recruit and retain insurance agents or if we lose the services provided by our managing general agents 
we may be required to refund or reduce premiums if our premium rates are determined to be too high 
insurance regulators require that we maintain minimum statutory loss ratios on some of the insurance products that we sell 
we must therefore pay out  on average  a specified minimum percentage of premiums as benefits to policyholders 
state regulations also mandate the manner in which insurance companies may compute loss ratios and the manner in which compliance is measured and enforced 
if our insurance products are not in compliance with state mandated minimum loss ratios  state regulators may require us to refund or reduce premiums 
we have stopped selling new long term care insurance and the premiums that we charge for the policies that remain in force may not be adequate to cover the claims expenses that we incur 
we have concluded that the sale of long term care insurance does not fit within our strategic or financial goals 
we began to curtail the sale of new business in  and stopped all new sales at the end of approximately  million of premium remains in force  of which we retain approximately million 
the overall block of business continues to generate losses  however we have incurred substantial losses from a specific block of florida home health care business that we stopped selling in there can be no assurance that current premiums we charge will be adequate to cover the claims expenses that we will incur in the future 
there is also no assurance that rate increases that we may seek will be approved by the applicable state regulators or  if approved  will be adequate to fully mitigate adverse loss experience 
risks related to our prescription drug plan business we have incurred and may continue to incur significant expenses in connection with implementing our new prescription drug benefits  which may have an adverse effect on our near term operating results 
we received approval from cms to provide prescription drug benefits  as a stand alone pdp  under medicare part d 
we have incurred expenses to upgrade and improve our infrastructure  technology  and systems to manage our new prescription drug benefits 
we incurred significant expenses in as we prepared to provide these prescription drug benefits as of january  and will continue to incur additional expenses 
in particular  our expenses incurred in connection with the implementation of our prescription drug benefits related to the following hiring and training of personnel to establish and manage systems  operations  regulatory relationships  and materials  systems development and upgrade costs  including hardware  software  and development resources  marketing and sales  enrolling new members and verifying eligibility with cms  developing and distributing member materials such as id cards and member welcome kits  and handling sales inquiry and customer service calls 
recent challenges faced by cms and our plans information and reporting systems related to implementation of part d may temporarily disrupt or adversely affect our plans relationships with our members 
partially in anticipation of the implementation of part d  cms transitioned to new information and reporting systems  which have recently generated confusing and  we believe in some cases  erroneous membership and payment reports concerning our and others medicare eligibility and enrollment  most of which we believe reflects inadvertently dis enrolled dual eligible and other beneficiaries who were already members of one of our plans 
in addition  recent media reports are prevalent concerning the confusion caused by failures in systems and reporting for part d  particularly as these failures adversely affect the access of dual eligibles and low income beneficiaries to obtain their prescription drugs 
these developments have caused our plans to experience short term disruptions in their operations and challenged our information and communications systems 
although we believe the current conditions are temporary  there can be no assurance that the current confusion  systems failures  and erroneous payment reports will not temporarily disrupt or adversely affect our plans relationships with our members  which could result in a reduction of our membership and adversely affect our results of operations 
there are significant risks associated with our participation in the medicare part d program 
our participation in the medicare part d program involves a number of risks  including the following cms continues to release regulations on part d  including important requirements related to the implementation and marketing of the part d prescription drug benefit plan 
this will create challenges for planning and implementation of our part d program  and there is no assurance that congress or cms will not alter the program in a manner that will be detrimental to us 
we will incur significant expenditures of time and resources in developing this program  and we may need to divert human resources from other areas of the company 
although we believe that we have the capability to meet our staffing needs  it is possible that the fulfillment of our administrative duties in other areas may suffer 
we cannot be certain that our products will be competitive  as compared to other pdp s 
we are making actuarial assumptions about the utilization of benefits in our pdp s 
because part d is a newly created program  there is no historical basis for these assumptions  and we cannot be assured that these assumptions will prove to be correct and that premiums will be sufficient to cover benefits 
we cannot be assured that potential members will accept and acquire insurance from our pdps  and therefore our anticipated sales under the program may generate significantly less revenue than our current expectations 
as of december   cms had automatically assigned dual eligibles to our pdp plans in regions where our price is under the regional benchmarks 
we cannot guarantee that all of these dual eligibles assigned to us will enroll in our pdp s 
in addition  because dual eligible beneficiaries can change their pdp each month  we can not assure that the dual eligible beneficiaries who are automatically assigned to our pdp s will remain in our pdp s 
part d is a new program and the competitive landscape is uncertain 
we expect to encounter competition from other pdp sponsors  some of whom may have significantly greater resources and brand recognition than we do 
our marketing arrangement with cvs is non exclusive  and cvs has entered into marketing arrangements with our competitors 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to effectively compete in this new market 
the costs of developing and marketing our pdp s will vary based upon the size of membership in our pdp s 
given the uncertainties and risks described above  the cost of developing pdp s that will allow us to effectively compete in this new market could exceed our current expectations 
companies that offer medicare advantage plans  including us  will be required to offer prescription drug benefits in as part of the medicare advantage plans 
such combined managed care plans offering drug benefits are  under the new law  called ma pd s 
it is not known at this time whether the governmental payments will be adequate to cover our actual costs for these new ma pd benefits or  in light of our inexperience with this program  whether we will be able to profitably or competitively manage our ma pd s 
some enrollees may have chosen our medicare advantage plan in the past rather than those of our competitors or traditional medicare fee for service because of the drug benefit that we offer with our medicare advantage plans 
we do not know at this time whether our pdp or ma pd benefits will be as or more attractive than those of our competitors 
additionally  medicare beneficiaries that participate in a medicare advantage plan that enroll in a pdp will be automatically dis enrolled from their medicare advantage plan 
accordingly  the existence of new pdp s in our service areas could result in our members intentionally or inadvertently dis enrolling from our plans and reduce our membership and profitability 
there is uncertainty as to whether the dual eligibles auto assigned to us for will be re assigned to our pdp s in we can not be certain that our bids for will be competitive to those bids submitted by other pdp s 
if our current providers  including our pbm  terminate their contracts  we will have to contract with other providers to take their place

item legal proceedings securities class action and derivative litigation five actions containing related factual allegations were filed against the company and certain of its officers and directors between november  and february  one of these actions was voluntarily withdrawn by plaintiffs  and four actions are now pending 
in the first action  robert kemp filed a purported class action complaint the kemp action on november   in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the kemp action is a purported class action asserted on behalf of those shareholders of the company who acquired the company s common stock between february  and october  plaintiffs in the kemp action seek unspecified damages under section b and a of the securities exchange act of based upon allegedly false statements by the company and richard a 
barasch  robert a 
waegelein and gary w 
bryant hereinafter  the officer defendants in press releases  financial statements and analyst conferences during the class period 
another purported class action was recently filed by western trust laborers employers pension trust the western trust action  a putative class member in the kemp action who had filed a motion to be named as lead plaintiff in that action  on february   in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the factual and legal allegations in the western trust action  which also purports to be a class action  are similar to those in the kemp action 
two additional actions have been brought derivatively by shareholders purporting to act on behalf of the company  and not as class actions 
one of these was filed by green meadows partners llp the green meadows action on december   in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
in the green meadows action  plaintiffs seek contribution under section b and d of the exchange act on the ground that if the company is found liable to have violated the securities laws in the kemp action  then the officer defendants are liable for contribution 
the green meadows action also asserts three claims under state law for breach of fiduciary duty against the officer defendants 
the second derivative action was filed by plaintiff arthur tsutsui the tsutsui action on december   in the supreme court for new york state  westchester county 
the defendants in the tsutsui action are the three officer defendants named in the other actions  as well as all of the directors sitting on the company s board of directors as of the time the complaint was filed 
the tsutsui action alleges that the same alleged misstatements that are the subject of the kemp action constituted a breach of fiduciary duty by the officer defendants and the directors that caused the company to sustain damages 
the tsutsui action also seeks recovery of any proceeds derived by the officer defendants from the sale of company stock that was in breach of their fiduciary duties 
all of the cases are at a preliminary stage 
in the class actions  motions concerning the appointment of lead plaintiff are pending before the court 
the defendants were not required to respond to these motions  and did not do so 
the time for the defendants initially to respond to the class actions will not expire until at least days after the court enters an order concerning the appointment of lead plaintiff 
in the derivative actions  the time for defendants initially to respond to both complaints was extended to april  each of the officer defendants denies the allegations and has indicated that he intends to vigorously defend against the allegations 
management believes that after liability insurance recoveries  none of these actions will have a material adverse effect on us 
other litigation we have litigation in the ordinary course of our business  including claims for medical  disability and life insurance benefits  and in some cases  seeking punitive damages 
management believes that after liability insurance recoveries  none of these actions will have a material adverse effect on us

as additional information becomes available or actual amounts become determinable  the recorded estimates may be revised and reflected in operating results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounts that  in our judgment  are most critical to the preparation of our financial statements include policy related liabilities  deferred policy acquisition costs  intangible assets  valuation of certain investments and deferred income taxes 
there have been no changes in our critical accounting policies during the current quarter 
policy related liabilities we calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders using the same actuarial assumptions that we use in the pricing of our products 
for our accident and health insurance business  we establish an active life reserve for expected future policy benefits  plus a liability for due and unpaid claims  claims in the course of settlement and incurred but not reported claims 
many factors can affect these reserves and liabilities  such as economic and social conditions  inflation  hospital and pharmaceutical costs  changes in doctrines of legal liability  premium rate increases and extra contractual damage awards 
therefore  the reserves and liabilities we establish are based on extensive estimates  assumptions and prior years statistics 
when we acquire other insurance companies or blocks of insurance  our assessment of the adequacy of acquired policy liabilities is subject to similar estimates and assumptions 
establishing reserves involves inherent uncertainties  and it is possible that actual claims could materially exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our net income depends significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in setting our reserves and pricing our policies 
if our assumptions with respect to future claims are incorrect  and our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and expenses  we would be required to increase our liabilities resulting in reduced net income and shareholders equity 
deferred policy acquisition costs the cost of acquiring new business  principally non level commissions  agency production  policy underwriting  policy issuance  and associated costs  all of which vary with  and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business  are deferred 
for interest sensitive life and annuity products  these costs are amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross profits on the policies arising principally from investment  mortality and expense margins in accordance with fas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments 
for other life and health products  these costs are amortized in proportion to premium revenue using the same assumptions used in estimating the liabilities for future policy benefits in accordance with fas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
amortization of deferred acquisition costs for medicare supplement policies is periodically adjusted for significant changes in benefit structures and differences in assumed premium rates on a prospective basis  consistent with assumptions used in the related reserves for future policy benefits 
during  the company determined that the historical actual approved rate increases and persistency were higher than assumed levels 
the prospective unlocking of these assumptions resulted in a slower amortization of medicare supplement deferred acquisition costs 
the determination of expected gross profits for interest sensitive products is an inherently uncertain process that relies on assumptions including projected interest rates  the persistency of the policies issued as well as anticipated benefits  commissions and expenses 
it is possible that the actual profits from the business may vary materially from the assumptions used in the determination and amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs are written off to the extent that it is determined that future policy premiums and investment income or expected gross profits would not be adequate to recover the unamortized costs 
present value of future profits and other intangibles business combinations accounted for as a purchase result in the allocation of the purchase consideration to the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired  including the present value of future profits  establishing such fair values as the new accounting basis 
the present value of future profits is based on an estimate of the cash flows of the in force business acquired  discounted to reflect the present value of those cash flows 
the discount rate selected depends upon the general market conditions at the time of the acquisition and the inherent risk in the transaction 
purchase consideration in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired  including the present value of future profits and other identified intangibles  for a specific acquisition  is allocated to goodwill 
allocation of purchase price is performed in the period in which the purchase is consummated 
adjustments  if any  in subsequent periods relate to resolution of pre acquisition contingencies and refinements made to estimates of fair value in connection with the preliminary allocation 
amortization of present value of future profits is based upon the pattern of the projected cash flows of the in force business acquired  over weighted average lives ranging from six to forty years 
other identified intangibles are amortized over their estimated lives 
on a periodic basis  management reviews the unamortized balances of present value of future profits  goodwill and other identified intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets is not recoverable  in which case an impairment charge would be recognized 
management believes that no impairments of present value of future profits  goodwill or other identified intangibles existed as of december  investment valuation fair value of investments is based upon quoted market prices  where available  or on values obtained from independent pricing services 
for certain mortgage backed and asset backed securities  the determination of fair value is based primarily upon the amount and timing of expected future cash flows of the security 
estimates of these cash flows are based upon current economic conditions  past credit loss experience and other circumstances 
we regularly evaluate the amortized cost of our investments compared to the fair value of those investments 
impairments of securities generally are recognized when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is considered to be other than temporary 
generally  we consider a decline in fair value to be other than temporary when the fair value of an individual security is below amortized cost for an extended period and we do not believe that recovery in fair value is probable 
impairment losses for certain mortgage backed and asset backed securities are recognized when an adverse change in the amount or timing of estimated cash flows occurs  unless the adverse change is solely a result of changes in estimated market interest rates and we intend to hold the security until maturity 
the cost basis for securities determined to be impaired are reduced to their fair value  with the excess of the cost basis over the fair value recognized as a realized investment loss 
income taxes we use the liability method to account for deferred income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of a change in tax rates 
we establish valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets for amounts that we determine will not be recoverable based upon our analysis of projected taxable income and our ability to implement prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
increases in these valuation allowances are recognized as deferred tax expense 
subsequent determinations that portions of the valuation allowances are no longer necessary are reflected as deferred tax benefits 
to the extent that valuation allowances were established in conjunction with acquisitions  changes in those allowances are first applied to increasing or decreasing the goodwill but not below zero or other intangibles related to the acquisition and then applied as an increase or decrease in income tax expense 
during the year ended december   we released approximately million of valuation allowances on tax capital loss carryforwards as a result of investments gains taken during that period 
as of december  we have million of valuation allowances on tax capital loss carryforwards remaining 
significant transactions and initiatives medicare opportunity we believe that attractive growth opportunities exist in providing a range of products  particularly health insurance  to the growing senior market 
at present  more than million americans are eligible for medicare  the federal program that offers basic hospital and medical insurance to people over years old plus certain disabled people under the age of the standard medicare coverage does not cover prescription drugs except as required in the course of a covered hospital stay 
according to the us census bureau  more than million americans turn in the united states each year  and this number is expected to grow as the so called baby boomers begin to turn in addition  many large employers who traditionally provided medical and prescription drug coverage to their retirees have begun to curtail these benefits 
finally  the passage of the medicare modernization act of the mma demonstrated the federal government s commitment to expand the healthcare options available to medicare beneficiaries through the expansion of medicare managed care plans medicare advantage and the authorization of a subsidized prescription drug insurance benefit pursuant to part d part d 
taken together  these conditions present significant opportunities for us to increase the sale of our products 
medicare advantage as a result of the increased reimbursement rates from the centers for medicare and medicaid services  the federal agency that administers the medicare advantage program cms  medicare advantage plans are able to offer more attractive benefits including enhanced prescription drug coverage pursuant to part d 
consequently  we believe that enrollment in medicare advantage programs is likely to increase in the coming years 
we entered the medicare advantage business in with the acquisition of heritage health systems  inc which operates medicare advantage coordinated care plans in southeastern texas 
since  heritage has expanded its service area to include counties in texas  and has begun to offer an hmo product in three counties in florida brevard  broward and miami dade in in  we began to offer medicare advantage pffs plans in new york and pennsylvania 
as of january  we are marketing pffs plans in a total of states 
medicare supplement medicare supplement insurance reimburses the policyholder for certain expenses that are not covered by standard medicare coverage such as deductibles and co pays 
this coverage is designed for people who want the freedom to choose providers who participate in the standard medicare program  as opposed to the more restrictive networks that exist in medicare advantage products 
in the past ten years  we have become a successful provider of medicare supplement coverage as well as other products designed for the senior market 
we believe that the market for medicare supplement products will continue to be attractive  especially because many seniors may lose similar coverage that had previously been offered to them as a retiree benefit by their former employers 
recently  there has been increased competition from other medicare supplement carriers  as well as from medicare advantage plans  which has affected our production of medicare supplement business 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we experienced medicare supplement claim costs that were higher than the comparable quarters of the prior year  and higher than we had anticipated 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a pre tax adjustment that increased incurred claims by million  or per diluted share after tax 
two factors caused this action 
first  incurred claims increased by million as a result of a change in the estimate of the company s medicare supplement claim reserves of million  offset by an increase in amounts recoverable from reinsurers of million 
second  the company determined that  over a four year period  it had overstated the amounts recoverable from reinsurers for ceded medicare supplement claim reserves 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decreased its recoverable from reinsurers for ceded medicare supplement claim reserves by million 
approximately million of the decrease was determined to relate to the first three quarters of and million of the decrease was determined to relate to the years through when the effect of the reserve adjustments relating to prior periods is eliminated  the estimated pro forma medicare supplement loss ratio for the full year was 
the increase in our medicare supplement loss ratio was primarily as a result of higher than anticipated outpatient doctor part b and skilled nursing facility utilization 
we also experienced higher than expected lapsation in our medicare supplement business 
we believe that there are a number of factors contributing to the lapsation  including competitive pressure from other medicare supplement companies and medicare advantage products  as well as the departure of certain of our sales managers 
this excess lapsation required us to accelerate the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost and present value of future profits assets associated with the business that lapsed 
we cannot give assurances that lapsation of our medicare supplement business will decline from the level  requiring faster amortization of the deferred costs 
medicare part d effective january   private insurers were permitted to sponsor insured stand alone prescription drug benefit plans pdp s pursuant to part d  which was established by the mma 
a portion of the premium for this insurance is paid by the federal government  and the balance  if any  is paid by the individuals who enroll 
the federal government will also provide additional subsidies in the form of premium support and coverage of the cost sharing elements of the plan to certain low income medicare beneficiaries 
we have been approved to offer these programs in of the regions that have been established for this program 
reinsurance connecticut state employees during the third quarter of  we commenced a new reinsurance arrangement with pharmacare captive re  ltd

trust preferred securities all have scheduled maturities of years from the dates of issue  however they are all callable by us five years from the date of issuance 
for the purpose of this schedule  we have assumed that the securities will be redeemed at their scheduled maturities  not the call date 
accordingly  the obligation for repayment of principal relating to these is included in the more than years column 
the trust preferred securities all have floating rate coupons  except for million which has a fixed rate through its no call period and then converts to a floating rate 
additionally  we have entered into separate swap agreements whereby we pay fixed rates on million of the trust preferred securities through the no call period 
we did not project future changes in the base interest rates

includes minimum obligations on our data center outsourcing contract  as well as our outsourced administrative service contracts for certain portions of our part d business and our hmo product see outsourcing arrangements above 
our actual monthly payments are affected by the amount of service provided under the contract and the levels of business administered and currently the actual payments exceed the minimums stated in the contracts 
therefore our actual payments will exceed the amounts presented in the above schedule based upon future usage and premium amounts 
the obligations on policy related liabilities represent those payments we expect to make on death  disability and health insurance claims and policy surrenders 
these projected values contain assumptions for future policy persistency  mortality and morbidity comparable with our historical experience 
the distribution of payments for policy and contract claims includes assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amounts of those claims 
actual amounts and timing of both future policy benefits and policy and contract claims may differ significantly from the estimates above

dividends from penncorp life canada funded all the interest and principal paid on the debenture 
sources of liquidity to the parent company we anticipate funding the obligations of the parent company and the capital required to grow our business from the four distinct and uncorrelated sources of cash flow within the organization as follows the expected cash flows of our senior administrative services company  the expected cash flows of our senior managed care company acquired in the acquisition of heritage  dividend payments received from penncorp life canada  and surplus note principal and interest payments from american exchange 
in addition  we have access to the million available under the revolving portion of our credit facility 
finally  we have the ability  from time to time  to access the capital markets for additional capital 
there can be no assurance as to our actual future cash flows  from the continued availability of dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries or from access to the capital markets 
the issues affecting the profitability of the company during the third and fourth quarters of  as discussed in the managements discussion and analysis  do not materially affect the sources of liquidity to the parent company as discussed below 
the increase in the medicare supplement loss ratios is confined to insurance companies that we do not look to for significant cash flow 
the increased amortization of deferred acquisition cost and present value of future profits is a non cash item 
senior administrative services company 
liquidity for our senior administrative services subsidiary is measured by its ability to pay operating expenses and pay dividends to our parent company 
the primary source of liquidity is fees collected from clients 
we believe that the sources of cash for our senior administrative services company exceed scheduled uses of cash and results in amounts available to dividend to our parent holding company 
we measure the ability of the senior administrative services company to pay dividends based on its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
ebitda for our senior administrative services segment was million for the year ended december   million for and million for the reduction in ebitda from to was a result of the million of expenses incurred in this segment relating to our implementation of part d 
senior managed care company 
liquidity for our managed care company is measured by its ability to pay operating expenses and pay dividends to our parent company 
the primary source of liquidity is management fees for administration of scot and services provided to the ipa s 
dividend payments by scot to heritage are subject to the approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of the state of texas  scot s state of domicile 
scot is not able to pay dividends during without prior approval 
however  we believe that the sources of cash to our managed care holding company exceed scheduled uses of cash which will result in funds available to dividend to our parent holding company 
we measure the ability of the senior managed care holding company to pay dividends based on its ebitda 
ebitda for our senior managed care holding company was for the year ended december  and million for the seven months since its acquisition on may  through december  penncorp life canada dividends 
penncorp life canada is a canadian insurance company 
canadian law provides that a life insurer may pay a dividend after such dividend declaration has been approved by its board of directors and upon at least days prior notification to the superintendent of financial institutions 
such a dividend is limited to retained net income based on canadian gaap for the preceding two years  plus net income earned for the current year 
in considering approval of a dividend  the board of directors must consider whether the payment of such dividend would be in contravention of the insurance companies act of canada 
during  penncorp life canada paid dividends of c million approximately us million to universal american 
during  penncorp life canada became subject to a withholding tax on dividends paid to universal american 
the withholding tax paid on the dividends from penncorp life canada in was c million approximately us million 
during the first quarter of  penncorp life canada paid dividends of c million approximately us million to universal american  relating to net income 
the amount of the dividend was larger than normal due to a benefit received by penncorp life canada from an actuarial experience study that allowed penncorp life canada to reduce its policy benefit reserves at december  on a canadian gaap basis 
the actuarial experience study did not have an impact on penncorp life canada s policy benefit reserves on a us gaap basis 
during the remainder of  penncorp life canada paid dividends totaling c million us million relating to net income for penncorp life canada paid dividends to universal american totaling c million us million during due to limitations resulting from the timing of prior dividend payments by penncorp canada  we do not anticipate that penncorp canada will be able to pay dividends in  without prior approval 
insurance subsidiaries surplus note  dividends and capital contributions 
cash generated by our insurance company subsidiaries will be made available to our holding company  principally through periodic payments of principal and interest on the surplus note owed to our holding company by our subsidiary  american exchange life 
as of december   the principal amount of the surplus note was million 
the note bears interest to our parent holding company at libor plus basis points 
we anticipate that the surplus note will be primarily serviced by dividends from pennsylvania life  a wholly owned subsidiary of american exchange  and by tax sharing payments among the insurance companies that are wholly owned by american exchange and file a consolidated federal income tax return 
american exchange made principal payments totaling million during the year ended december  and payments totaling million during the year ended december  no principal payments were made during american exchange paid interest on the surplus note of million during the year ended december   million in  and million in our parent holding company made capital contributions to american exchange amounting to million during in september  pennsylvania life declared and paid a dividend in the amount of million to american exchange 
american exchange made capital contributions of million to american pioneer  million to american progressive  million to pennsylvania life  million to constitution and million to union bankers during the year ended december  additionally  during  pennsylvania life made a capital contribution of million to pyramid life 
our parent holding company made capital contributions to american exchange amounting to million during in march  pennsylvania life declared and paid a dividend in the amount of million to american exchange 
american exchange made capital contributions of million to union bankers  million to american pioneer and million to american progressive during the year ended december  during the year ended december   no dividends were declared or paid by the us insurance company subsidiaries to american exchange 
during  american exchange received capital contributions from its parent totaling million 
american exchange made capital contributions of million to pennsylvania life  primarily relating to the acquisition of pyramid life  million to american pioneer  million to american progressive and million to union bankers 
pennsylvania life contributed million to pyramid life in dividend payments by our us insurance companies to our holding company or to intermediate subsidiaries are limited by  or subject to the approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of each insurance company s state of domicile 
such dividend requirements and approval processes vary significantly from state to state 
pennsylvania life is able to pay ordinary dividends of up to million to american exchange during  without prior approval 
insurance subsidiaries liquidity liquidity for our insurance company subsidiaries is measured by their ability to pay scheduled contractual benefits  pay operating expenses  fund investment commitments  and pay dividends to their parent company 
the principal sources of cash for our insurance operations include scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on investments  premium payments  annuity deposits  and the sale or maturity of investments 
both the sources and uses of cash are reasonably predictable and we believe that these sources of cash for our insurance company subsidiaries exceed scheduled uses of cash 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including benefits under accident and health insurance policies  death benefits and interest sensitive policy surrenders and withdrawals 
our accident and health insurance policies generally provide for fixed benefit amounts and  in the case of medicare supplement policies  for supplemental payments to medicare provider rates 
some of these benefits are subject to medical cost inflation and we have the capability to file for premium rate increases to mitigate rising medical costs 
our health insurance business is widely dispersed in the united states and canada  which mitigates the risk of unexpected increases in claim payments due to epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature 
these accident and health polices are not interest sensitive and therefore are not subject to unexpected policyholder redemptions due to investment yield changes 
some of our life insurance and annuity policies are interest sensitive in nature 
the amount of surrenders and withdrawals is affected by a variety of factors such as credited interest rates for similar products  general economic conditions and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
although the contractual terms of substantially all of our in force life insurance policies and annuities give the holders the right to surrender the policies and annuities  we impose penalties for early surrenders 
as of december  we held reserves that exceeded the underlying cash surrender values of our net retained in force life insurance and annuities by million 
our insurance subsidiaries  in our view  have not experienced any material changes in surrender and withdrawal activity in recent years 
changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and withdrawals 
in addition to the potential impact on liquidity  unanticipated surrenders and withdrawals in a changed interest rate environment could adversely affect earnings if we were required to sell investments at reduced values in order to meet liquidity demands 
we manage our asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings impact of changing market rates 
we have segregated a portion of our investment portfolio in order to match liabilities that are sensitive to interest rate movements with fixed income securities containing similar characteristics to the related liabilities  most notably the expected duration and required interest spread 
we believe that this asset liability management process adequately covers the expected payment of benefits related to these liabilities 
as of december   our insurance company subsidiaries held cash and cash equivalents totaling million  as well as fixed maturity securities that could readily be converted to cash with carrying values and fair values of billion 
the net yields on our cash and invested assets decreased to for the year ended december   from for and for a portion of these securities are held to support the liabilities for policyholder account balances  which liabilities are subject to periodic adjustments to their credited interest rates 
the credited interest rates of the interest sensitive policyholder account balances are determined by us based upon factors such as portfolio rates of return and prevailing market rates and typically follow the pattern of yields on the assets supporting these liabilities 
our domestic insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum amounts of statutory capital and surplus as required by regulatory authorities 
however  substantially more than the statutory minimum amounts are needed to meet statutory and administrative requirements of adequate capital and surplus to support the current level of our insurance subsidiaries operations 
each of our insurance subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus exceeds its respective minimum statutory requirement at levels we believe are sufficient to support their current levels of operation 
additionally  the national association of insurance commissioners naic imposes regulatory risk based capital rbc requirements on life insurance enterprises 
at december   all of our insurance subsidiaries maintained ratios of total adjusted capital to rbc in excess of the authorized control level

there were no non income producing fixed maturities as of december  during the years ended december  and  we did not write down the value of any fixed maturity securities 
we wrote down the value of certain fixed maturity securities  considered to have been subject to an other than temporary decline in value  by million during in each case  these write downs represent our estimate of other than temporary declines in value and were included in net realized gains on investments in our consolidated statements of operations 
federal income taxation of the company we file a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes that includes all of the non life insurance company subsidiaries  including heritage 
american progressive was included in the consolidated return through march  and american pioneer was included through june  american exchange and its subsidiaries and penncorp life canada are not currently included 
american exchange and its subsidiaries  including american progressive since april  and american pioneer since july   filed a separate consolidated federal return 
penncorp life canada files a separate return with the canada revenue agency 
at december   the company exclusive of american exchange and its subsidiaries and penncorp life had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million including million from heritage that expire in and and capital loss carryforwards of million that expire in at december   the company also had an alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that can be carried forward indefinitely

as a result of changes in ownership of the company in july  the use of most of the loss carryforwards of the company are subject to annual limitations 
the company establishes valuation allowances based upon an analysis of projected taxable income and its ability to implement prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
the company carried valuation allowances on its deferred tax assets of million at december  and million at december  at december   the valuation allowance on certain of the life tax loss carryforwards no longer was considered necessary and the company released the valuation allowance of million which was reported as a deferred income tax benefit 
as a result of uncertainty regarding the ability to generate taxable capital gains to utilize capital loss carryforwards  the company established a valuation allowance in the amount of million during that was reported as a deferred income tax expense 
approximately million of the valuation allowance related to the capital loss carryforward was released during  and reported as a deferred income tax benefit  as capital gains were generated and the company was able to realize the benefit from the capital loss carryforwards 
during  the company incurred creditable foreign taxes related to dividends from penncorp life  its canadian subsidiary  generating a foreign tax credit carryforward  for which a deferred tax asset of approximately million was established

during  the company released million relating to a portion of reserve amounts established for pre acquisition tax years of certain life insurance subsidiaries that were being examined by the internal revenue service

our us insurance company subsidiaries  other than peninsular life insurance company  are taxed as life insurance companies as provided in the internal revenue code 
the omnibus budget reconciliation act of amended the internal revenue code to require a portion of the expenses incurred in selling insurance products to be capitalized and amortized over a period of years  as opposed to an immediate deduction in the year incurred 
instead of measuring actual selling expenses  the amount capitalized for tax purposes is based on a percentage of premiums 
in general  the capitalized amounts are subject to amortization over a ten year period 
since this change only affects the timing of the deductions  it does not  assuming stability of rates  affect the provisions for taxes reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
however  by deferring deductions  the change has the effect of increasing our current tax expense and reducing statutory surplus 
there was no material increase in our current income tax provision for any of the three years in the period ended december  due to the existence of our insurance company subsidiaries net operating loss carryforwards 
the jobs creation tax act of contains a provision that places a two year moratorium on the imposition of tax on distributions from policyholder surplus accounts psa 
additionally  the ordering rules were changed to allow for the first dollar of any distribution to reduce the psa 
any distribution during and from an insurance company that has a psa will be treated as a distribution from its psa account 
however  the distribution will not be subject to federal income tax 
as of december   we had million of psa balances and have accrued million in deferred tax liabilities corresponding to those balances

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in general  market risk relates to changes in the value of financial instruments that arise from adverse movements in interest rates  equity prices and foreign exchange rates 
we are exposed principally to changes in interest rates that affect the market prices of our fixed income securities as well as the cost of our variable rate debt 
additionally  we are exposed to changes in the canadian dollar that affects the translation of the financial position and the results of operations of our canadian subsidiary from canadian dollars to us dollars 
investment interest rate sensitivity our profitability could be affected if we were required to liquidate fixed income securities during periods of rising and or volatile interest rates 
however  we attempt to mitigate our exposure to adverse interest rate movements through a combination of active portfolio management and by staggering the maturities of our fixed income investments to assure sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations and to address reinvestment risk considerations 
our insurance liabilities generally arise over relatively long periods of time  which typically permits ample time to prepare for their settlement 
certain classes of mortgage backed securities are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that in periods of declining interest rates  individuals may refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of the lower rates then available 
we monitor and adjust our investment portfolio mix to mitigate this risk 
we regularly conduct various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rate on our financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect our assessment as being reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
the magnitude of changes modeled in the accompanying analyses should not be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather  be treated as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on our financial results 
the sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk assumes an instantaneous shift in a parallel fashion across the yield curve  with scenarios of interest rates increasing and decreasing and basis points from their levels as of december   and with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a pre tax decrease in the market value of our fixed income investments of million and a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in million decrease 
similarly  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in a pre tax increase in the market value of our fixed income investments of million and a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in a million increase 
debt we pay interest on our term loan and a portion of our trust preferred securities based on the london inter bank offering rate libor for one  two or three months 
due to the variable interest rate  the company would be subject to higher interest costs if short term interest rates rise 
we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to adverse interest rate movements by fixing the rate on million of the trust preferred securities for a five year period through the contractual terms of the security at inception and an additional million through the use of interest rate swaps 
we regularly conduct various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rate on our financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect our assessment as being reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
the magnitude of changes modeled in the accompanying analyses should not be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather  be treated as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on our financial results 
the sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk assumes scenarios increases or decreases in libor of and basis points from their levels as of and for the year ended december   and with all other variables held constant 
the following table summarizes the impact of changes in libor 
effect of change in libor on pre tax income for the year ended december  description of floating rate debt weighted average interest rate weighted average balance outstanding basis point decrease basis point decrease basis point increase basis point increase in millions loan payable other long term debt total as noted above  we have fixed the interest rate on million of our million of total debt outstanding  leaving million of the debt exposed to rising interest rates 
as of december  we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million in short duration floating rate investment securities 
we anticipate that the net investment income on this million will be positively impacted by rising interest rates and will mitigate the negative impact of rising interest rates on our debt 
currency exchange rate sensitivity portions of our operations are transacted using the canadian dollar as the functional currency 
as of and for the year ended december   approximately of our assets  of our revenues  excluding realized gains  and of our income before realized gains and taxes were derived from our canadian operations 
as of and for the year ended december   approximately of our assets  of our revenues  excluding realized gains  and of our income before realized gains and taxes were derived from our canadian operations 
accordingly  our earnings and shareholder s equity are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to the canadian dollar 
although this risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that both the assets and liabilities for our foreign operations are denominated in canadian dollars  we are still subject to translation gains and losses 
we periodically conduct various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in the foreign currency exchange rate on our financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect our assessment of what is reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar  as compared to the actual average exchange rate for the year ended december   would have resulted in a decrease in our income before realized gains and taxes of approximately million for the year ended december  and a decrease in our shareholders equity of approximately million at december  a weakening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would have resulted in an increase in our income before realized gains and taxes of approximately million for the year ended december  and an increase in shareholders equity of approximately million at december  our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in any potential change in sales levels  local prices or any other variables 
the magnitude of changes reflected in the above analysis regarding interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates should  in no manner  be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on our financial results
