item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general emisphere technologies  inc is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the oral delivery of therapeutic macromolecules and other compounds that are not currently deliverable by oral means 
since our inception in  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts and resources to research and development conducted on our own behalf and in collaborations with corporate partners and academic research institutions 
our product pipeline includes product candidates for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases  osteoporosis  growth disorders  diabetes  asthma allergies  obesity and infectious diseases 
development and commercialization of these product candidates entails risk and significant expense 
since inception  we have had no product sales from these product candidates 
oral heparin and oral insulin are our two lead unpartnered programs 
during  we will continue to develop plans for advancing these two programs 
our strategy for the heparin program includes plans for a pivotal  phase iii trial designed to determine the safety and efficacy of oral heparin versus coumadin sodium warfarin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism following elective total hip replacement 
in further support of the heparin program  we are collecting data to demonstrate to the fda that the eligen technology does not change the heparin in any measurable way 
in this regard  during the third quarter of we conducted a multi arm  cross over  clinical trial with sixteen subjects to compare heparin delivered by different injection routes to heparin delivered orally in normal subjects 
our strategy for the insulin program includes a day phase ii trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of low and high doses of oral insulin tablets versus placebo in subjects with type diabetes who have inadequate glycemic control with metformin monotherapy 
we began dosing patients in that trial in december and expect to complete dosing in june we will also continue to advance our collaborations with roche on small molecule compounds for bone related diseases  with novartis on salmon calcitonin and recombinant human growth hormone  and with a pharmaceutical company based outside the united states to develop an improved oral formulation of the antiviral compound acyclovir 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   total cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and investments were million  which includes the million in restricted cash related to the mhr note 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will not enable us to continue operations past mid may of  or earlier if unforeseen events or circumstances arise that negatively affect our liquidity 
these circumstances may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital 
if we fail to raise additional capital or obtain substantial cash inflows from existing partners prior to may  we will be forced to cease operations 
if additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
we are in discussions with investment bankers concerning our financing options 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available on favorable terms or at all 
since our inception in  we have generated significant losses from operations and we anticipate that we will continue to generate significant losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our net loss was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the significant decrease in net loss is a result of the million gain on the extinguishment of the elan note payable 
our cash outlays from operations and capital expenditures were million for our stockholders equity decreased from million as of december  to a stockholders deficit of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we have limited capital resources and operations to date have been funded with the proceeds from collaborative research agreements  public and private equity and debt financings and income earned on investments 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the audit report prepared by our independent registered public accounting firm relating to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  includes an explanatory paragraph expressing the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
cash sources and uses cash inflows during include the equity financing completed in march  the mhr note payable issued in september  the sale of the farmington  connecticut facility  milestone payments and other research revenue received from partners 
the primary uses of cash have been repayment of debt obligations and funding current operations 
the following table summarizes cash flow activity for the year ended december  and year ended december  in thousands cash sources proceeds from issuance of equity securities proceeds from issuance of note payable proceeds from collection of ceo note receivable net proceeds from sales and purchases of investments proceeds from sales of fixed assets total cash sources cash uses cash used in operating activities repayment of debt obligations increase in restricted cash capital expenditures total cash uses decrease in cash the million increase in cash used in operating activities as compared to the prior year is primarily due to a million increase in professional fees paid related to the lilly litigation and the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act  a million decrease in cash received from partners and a million increase in net clinical trial expenses paid 
on august   dr 
goldberg repaid his outstanding note receivable to emisphere in full 
we received million in cash and  shares of emisphere common stock that had been held as collateral 
these shares were valued using the closing price on july  of and have been included in treasury stock 
as of december   we had million in restricted cash  which represents the remaining proceeds from the mhr note available for future drawdowns 
these amounts have been classified as restricted cash because the restricted cash account is controlled by mhr  and our right to draw down any of the funds in this account is conditioned upon the requested amounts being no more than of the budgeted cash requirements for the applicable period and our certification that no event of default or material adverse change  as defined in the loan agreement  has occurred and our representations and warranties under the loan agreement continue to be true and correct 
we have the right and the intent to use these funds to support current operations 
financing activities on september   we executed the loan agreement with mhr 
the loan agreement provides for a seven year  million secured loan from mhr to us at an interest rate of the loan 
the loan agreement was amended on november  to clarify certain terms 
net proceeds from the loan were approximately million  net of all transactional costs 
the loan is secured by a first priority lien in favor of mhr on substantially all of our assets 
the proceeds from the loan were disbursed to a restricted account and our right to have such funds disbursed to an operating account is conditioned upon the requested amounts for any period not being in excess of of amounts in our budget for such period then in effect under the terms of the loan agreement  and provided that we certify to mhr that no event of default has occurred under the loan agreement or the convertible note described below  as applicable  no material adverse change has occurred and our representations and warranties under the loan agreement continue to be true and correct 
the loan agreement requires us to hold a special stockholder meeting for the purpose of obtaining stockholder approval of i the exchange of the loan for an senior secured convertible note the convertible note with substantially the same terms as the loan agreement  except that the convertible note will be convertible  at the sole discretion of mhr or any assignee thereof  into shares of our common stock the conversion shares at a price per share of  interest will be payable in kind rather than in cash and we will have the right to call the convertible note after september  if certain conditions are satisfied and ii the amendment and restatement of our restated certificate of incorporation 
on december   we filed with the securities and exchange commission a definitive proxy statement relating to this special meeting of our stockholders 
on january   the special meeting of stockholders was held and both proposals were approved by our stockholders 
the loan agreement also provides that an event of default shall be deemed to have occurred if we default on the payment of any obligation or indebtedness when due  any of the liens in favor of mhr created by the transaction fails to constitute a perfected lien  we suffer a bankruptcy or similar insolvency event or proceeding  we materially breach a representation or warranty or fail to observe any covenant or agreement  we suffer and do not discharge in a timely manner a final judgment for the payment of a sum in excess of a certain materiality threshold  our common stock has been delisted or trading has been suspended  we sell a substantial portion of our assets  we merge with another entity without the prior consent of mhr  or any governmental action renders us unable to honor or perform our obligations under the loan agreement or results in a material adverse effect on our operations 
if an event of default occurs  the loan agreement provides for the immediate repayment of the loan and certain additional amounts described above and as set forth in the loan agreement 
in connection with the financing transaction  we amended mhr s existing warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to provide for additional anti dilution protection 
as of march   we completed the sale of million registered shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to million shares of common stock 
the stock and warrants were sold as units  each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock  at a price of per unit 
gross proceeds from the sale were million 
the net proceeds from this offering were million  net of total issuance costs of million 
million of the proceeds were used on april  for the extinguishment of the elan note 
in  we entered into a joint venture with elan to develop oral heparin 
in connection with the re purchase of elan s joint venture interest in  we issued a zero coupon note the original elan note to elan 
the original elan note had an issue price of million and an original issue discount at maturity of million and a maturity date of july  on december   we entered into a security purchase agreement with elan  providing for our purchase of our indebtedness to elan under the original elan note 
the value of the original elan note plus accrued interest on december  was approximately million 
pursuant to the security purchase agreement  we paid elan million and issued to elan  shares of our common stock with a market value of approximately million 
also  we issued to elan a new zero coupon note with an issue price of approximately million the modified elan note  representing the accrued value of the original elan note minus the sum of the cash payment and the value of the  shares 
in  we issued to elan a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of and made a million payment to elan  which completed our repurchase of our indebtedness to elan 
overview of operations revenue revenue increased during due in large part to the achievement of a milestone in the roche collaboration 
research and development research and development costs increased during as we increased efforts to prepare for a phase iii pivotal trial for heparin and began our phase ii trial for insulin 
financing we raised million through an equity offering in march and million by issuing a senior secured note to mhr in september the note is exchangeable for a senior secured convertible note at mhr s option 
prepayment of elan note payable we completed the repurchase of our note payable to elan in march  resulting in a non cash gain of million 
sale of farmington  connecticut facility we completed the sale of our farmington  connecticut research facility in june  resulting in net proceeds of million and a gain on sale of fixed assets of million 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  change change in thousands revenue research and development general and administrative expenses loss on impairment of fixed assets n m gain on sale of fixed assets n m depreciation and amortization operating expenses operating loss other income expense n m net loss revenue increased significantly as compared to as a result of the new collaborations signed with novartis and roche in the second half of under the novartis agreement  the original one year license period was extended through march  at no cost to novartis 
we cannot predict whether novartis will elect to commence the development phase of the project at that time 
the product being developed under the roche agreement entered phase i clinical trials in the second quarter of  triggering a milestone payment under the agreement 
the receipt of this milestone payment resulted in recognition of additional revenue  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy which limits revenue recognition to total non refundable cash received 
an additional milestone was reached under the roche agreement in february additional milestone payments under this agreement may not be earned in the short term or at all 
research and development costs increased by million compared to this increase is partly the result of an increase of million in clinical trial activity  specifically  completion of the heparin is heparin trial and the initiation of the phase ii insulin trial in india 
additionally  expenses were lowered by the receipt of a million credit upon completion of the final reconciliation of payments related to the protect liquid oral heparin trials 
the final cause of the increase is a rise in utility costs of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in outside laboratory analysis fees  which reflects a progression from pre clinical to clinical activities 
general and administrative expenses increased by million compared to the prior year 
the increase reflects an overall increase in professional fees  including million in consulting and accounting fees associated with implementing the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the million gain on sale of fixed assets relates to the sale of the farmington  connecticut research facility 
depreciation and amortization costs decreased by million as compared to this decrease in depreciation results from a decrease in capital expenditures over the last several years 
other expense and income was million of income in as compared to million of expense for several transactions affected this fluctuation 
first  includes million in interest expense related to the note payable to elan  which was repaid in the first quarter of interest expense for includes million related to the novartis note and million related to the mhr note 
also included in other income and expense in is the net increase in the fair value of derivative instruments of million 
in addition  includes a million gain on the extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of our indebtedness to elan and a million gain related to the sale of certain investments 
these gains were partially offset by decreases in investment and other income 
as a result of the above factors  we sustained a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  these results include a number of non recurring transactions the increase in revenue  the gain on the extinguishment of the note payable to elan  and the gains on the sales of fixed assets and investments and are therefore not necessarily indicative of future results 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  change change in thousands revenue research and development general and administrative expenses loss on impairment of fixed assets depreciation and amortization operating expenses operating loss other expense net loss revenue increased significantly as compared to as a result of the new collaborations signed with novartis and roche in the second half of research and development costs decreased by million compared to this decrease is comprised of a decrease in occupancy costs of million due to the surrender of a portion of the leased space at the tarrytown facility in late  a decrease in clinical trial expenses of million related to the final reconciliation of payments related to the protect liquid oral heparin trials and a million decrease in all other research costs 
the decrease in all other research costs of million consisted of million in reduced compensation and related expenses  million in reduced lab clinical supply costs  and million in lower consulting and other miscellaneous costs  which reflect an overall effort to reduce spending 
general and administrative expenses increased by million 
the increase is primarily the result of increased professional fees associated with the litigation with lilly 
the loss on impairment of fixed assets arose from the surrender to the landlord of approximately of our leased space at the tarrytown facility and from the impairment of equipment held for sale at the farmington  connecticut research facility 
depreciation and amortization costs decreased by million as compared to this decrease is primarily due to the surrender of the leased space at the tarrytown facility at the end of other expense and income increased by million compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily the result of a decrease in investment income of million and an increase in interest expense of million related to the note payable to elan 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion concerning the elan note 
the decrease in investment income resulted from lower cash and investment balances 
based on the above  we sustained a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  critical accounting estimates and new accounting pronouncements critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
revenue recognition revenue includes amounts earned from collaborative agreements and feasibility studies and is recognized using the lower of the percentage complete applied to expected contractual payments or the total non refundable cash received to date 
changes in the projected hours to complete the project could significantly change the amount of revenue recognized 
during the year ended december   we do not believe that reasonable changes in the projections would have had a material effect on recorded revenue 
purchased technology purchased technology represents the value assigned to patents and the rights to use  sell or license certain technology in conjunction with heparin 
these assets underlie our research and development projects related to solid oral heparin  and if the projects prove unsuccessful  the assets have no alternative future use 
cash flow projections for our potential heparin product greatly exceed the million book value of purchased technology 
however  if a competitor were to gain fda approval for an oral heparin product before us or future clinical trials related to oral heparin failed to meet the targeted endpoints  we would likely record an impairment related to these assets 
warrants and the mhr warrant purchase option warrants issued in connection with the kingsbridge common stock purchase agreement and the equity financing completed in march have been classified as liabilities due to certain provisions that may require cash settlement in certain circumstances 
the warrant purchase option contained in the mhr note is accounted for separately from the underlying debt and recorded as a derivative instrument 
this embedded derivative instrument was classified as a liability at issuance 
at each balance sheet date  we adjust the warrants and the warrant purchase option to reflect their current fair value 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments using the black scholes option pricing model which takes into account a variety of factors  including historical stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  remaining maturity and the closing price of our common stock 
changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these derivative instruments could result in a material change in the fair value of the instruments 
although we believe the assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the warrants and warrant purchase option are reasonable  we cannot assure the accuracy of the assumptions or estimates 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information on the volatility in market value of derivative instruments 
equipment and leasehold improvements 
equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are provided for on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs that do not materially extend the useful lives of the respective assets are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts and any gain or loss is recognized in operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value  is triggered if the carrying amount exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
we recognized an impairment on long lived assets of million during the year ended december  this impairment was based on estimates of future cash flows  including potential offers from third parties  quotes from scientific equipment resellers  and recent sales of similar equipment at auction or by us 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates  which would result in additional impairment losses or losses on disposal of the assets 
during  we conducted a full physical inventory of all laboratory equipment 
this inventory identified equipment with a net book value of thousand that could not be located within our facilities 
this equipment was removed from our books  and the loss of thousand was recorded in loss on impairment of fixed assets on the consolidated statement of operations 
clinical trial accrual methodology 
clinical trial expenses represent obligations resulting from our contracts with various research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
we account for those expenses on an accrual basis according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient enrollment and the timing of the various aspects of the trial 
accruals are recorded in accordance with the following methodology i the costs for period expenses  such as investigator meetings and initial start up costs  are expensed as incurred based on management s estimates  which are impacted by any change in the number of sites  number of patients and patient start dates  ii direct service costs  which are primarily on going monitoring costs  are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract  and iii principal investigator expenses that are directly associated with recruitment are recognized based on actual patient recruitment 
all changes to the contract amounts due to change orders are analyzed and recognized in accordance with the above methodology 
change orders are triggered by changes in the scope  time to completion and the number of sites 
during the course of a trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
the revised statement  sfas r  share based payment  establishes standards for share based transactions in which an entity receives employee s services for a equity instruments of the entity  such as stock options  or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas r eliminates the option of accounting for share based compensation transactions using apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and requires that companies expense the fair value of stock options and similar awards  as measured on the awards grant date 
for public companies  sfas r is effective at the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after december  we plan to adopt sfas r on january  sfas r applies to all awards granted after the date of adoption  and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after that date 
we have elected to apply sfas r using a modified version of prospective application  under which compensation cost is recognized only for the portion of awards outstanding for which the requisite service has not been rendered as of the adoption date  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under sfas for pro forma disclosures 
we have also elected to continue to use the black scholes model to value our share based payments 
we are currently evaluating the other requirements of sfas r 
we expect the adoption of sfas r will have a significant impact on our financial statements  but have not determined the extent of the impact 
we believe the impact of adopting sfas r  based on our unvested options outstanding at december   will be to increase our stock based employee compensation expense in by million to million 
the preceding excludes the effect of our employee stock purchase plan  which has not been determined 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas replaces apb  accounting changes  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of a change 
sfas also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas  as applicable  beginning january  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements with third parties that include indemnification provisions which  in our judgment  are normal and customary for companies in our industry sector 
these agreements are typically with business partners  clinical sites  and suppliers 
pursuant to these agreements  we generally agree to indemnify  hold harmless  and reimburse indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties with respect to our product candidates  use of such product candidates  or other actions taken or omitted by us 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
we have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions 
as a result  the estimated fair value of liabilities relating to these provisions is minimal 
accordingly  we have no liabilities recorded for these provisions as of december  in the normal course of business  we may be confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to lawsuits  claims  environmental actions or the actions of various regulatory agencies 
we consult with counsel and other appropriate experts to assess the claim 
if  in our opinion  we have incurred a probable loss as set forth by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  an estimate is made of the loss and the appropriate accounting entries are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
after consultation with legal counsel  we do not anticipate that liabilities arising out of currently pending or threatened lawsuits and claims  including the pending litigation described in part i  item legal proceedings  will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
significant contractual obligations as of december  are as follows amount due in type of obligation total obligation less than year to years to years more than years in thousands long term debt derivative liabilities capital lease obligations operating lease obligations clinical research organizations total amounts include both principal and related interest payments 
in december  we issued a million convertible note payable to novartis the novartis note due december interest may be paid annually or accreted as additional principal 
we may convert the novartis note at any time prior to maturity into a number of shares of our common stock equal to the principal and accrued and unpaid interest to be converted divided by the then market price of our common stock  provided certain conditions are met  including that the number of shares issued to novartis  when issued  does not exceed of the total shares of company common stock outstanding  that at the time of such conversion no event of default under the note has occurred and is continuing  and that there is either an effective shelf registration statement in effect covering the resale of the shares issued in connection with such conversion or the shares may be resold by novartis pursuant to sec rule k 
upon the occurrence of an event of default prior to conversion  any unpaid principal and accrued interest on the novartis note would become immediately due and payable 
if the novartis note is converted into our common stock  novartis would have the right to require us to repurchase the shares of common stock within six months after an event of default under the novartis note  for an aggregate purchase price equal to the principal and interest that was converted  plus interest from the date of conversion  as if no conversion had occurred 
at december   the balance on the novartis note was million 
in september  we issued a million note to mhr due september interest at is compounded monthly and payable quarterly until such time that mhr  at its sole discretion and after receiving the requisite stockholder approval  exchanges the loan for the convertible note 
if such an exchange occurs  the interest will then be accreted as additional principal 
see liquidity and capital resources above for further information concerning the mhr note 
at december   the balance on the mhr note was million 
the amount shown above assumes that the loan is exchanged for the convertible note in the first quarter of we have issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock which contain provisions requiring us to make a cash payment to the holders of the warrant for any gain that could have been realized if the holders exercise the warrants and we subsequently fail to deliver a certificate representing the shares to be issued upon such exercise by the third trading day after such warrants have been exercised 
as a result  these warrants have been classified as liabilities 
additionally  in conjunction with the mhr note  we issued options to purchase warrants containing the same cash payment provisions discussed above 
the warrants and warrant purchase option have been recorded at their fair value and are classified as current liabilities 
the value and timing of the actual cash payments related to these derivative instruments could differ materially from the amounts and periods shown 
we are obligated to make payments under certain contracts with third parties who provide clinical research services to support our ongoing research and development 
transactions with related parties during  two former members of the board of directors resigned their board positions and became consultants to emisphere 
the consulting agreements terminated in accordance with their original terms in november item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk fair value of warrants and derivative liabilities 
at december   the value of derivative instruments was million 
we estimate the fair values of these instruments using the black scholes option pricing model which takes into account a variety of factors  including historical stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  remaining maturity and the closing price of our common stock 
we believe that the assumption that has the greatest impact on the determination of fair value is the closing price of our common stock 
the following table illustrates the potential effect on the fair value of derivative instruments of changes in certain of the assumptions made increase decrease in thousands increase in stock price increase in stock price increase in assumed volatility decrease in stock price decrease in stock price decrease in assumed volatility investments 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while maximizing yield without significantly increasing risk 
our investments may consist of us mortgage backed securities  commercial paper  corporate notes and corporate equities 
our fixed rate interest bearing investments totaled million at december  these investments mature in less than one year 
we have classified all investments as short term based on our intent to liquidate the investments to fund operations over the upcoming twelve month period 
due to the conservative nature of our short term fixed interest rate investments maturities in less than one year  we do not believe that they have a material exposure to interest rate risk
