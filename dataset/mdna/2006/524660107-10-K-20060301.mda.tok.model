table of contents the company s commercial vehicle products unit  which primarily sells wire and steel racks  shelves and cabinets for the interior of service vans and utility vehicles  is reported in this form k in the commercial fixturing components segment 
effective october   the company created the commercial vehicle products group and unit in the specialized products segment following the acquisition of america s body company 
abc s main product categories include van interiors the racks  shelving  cabinets  etc 
installed in service vans and truck bodies for cargo vans  flatbed trucks  service trucks and dump trucks 
effective january   the prior commercial vehicle products unit was moved from the commercial fixturing components segment to the new commercial vehicle products group in the specialized products segment 
our second largest segment is commercial fixturing components 
this segment is divided into two groups  fixture display and office furniture components 
in the fixture display group  we believe that we are the industry s only one stop supplier  with broad capabilities that include design  production  installation and project management 
products manufactured by our fixture display group include custom designed  full store fixture packages  including shelving  counters  point of purchase displays  showcases  garment racks and decorative woodwork for retailers standardized shelving used by large retailers  grocery stores and discount chains commercial storage racks and carts material handling systems used primarily in the food service and healthcare industries wire and steel racks  shelves and cabinets for the interior of service vans and utility vehicles our office furniture components group manufactures bases  columns  back rests  casters and frames for office chairs  and control devices that allow office chairs to be adjusted to height  tilt and swivel injection molded plastic components for manufacturers of lawn care products  power tools  office furniture and other consumer and commercial products customers of the commercial fixturing components segment include retail chains and specialty shops brand name marketers and manufacturers food service companies  healthcare providers and restaurants office  institutional  and commercial furniture manufacturers key strategies our fixture display group strategy is to be the industry s most financially stable  and most customer oriented one stop supplier of fixture and display products 
our focus is to increase volume within current markets and also look for opportunities to expand into new  related markets 
in october  we announced the fixture display group tactical plan to increase our attention and scrutiny of under performing profit centers in the fixture display group 
this tactical plan was aimed at accomplishing improved operating efficiency  better adherence to standard costs  tighter inventory control  cost reduction  and more competent staffing 
over the past two years we made some progress 
however  in  we 
table of contents were hampered in our efforts to improve operating margins by the impact of new program start up costs and integration inefficiencies associated with the rhc spacemaster acquisition 
as part of the previously referenced restructuring plan and closure and consolidation initiative  we have identified facilities in commercial fixturing components  primarily in the fixture display group  that will be consolidated  sold  or closed 
for further information on our restructuring plan  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation beginning on page in our businesses serving office furniture manufacturers  we plan to develop new products  providing opportunities to supply more components to customers 
we also expect to continue making strategic acquisitions that add new products or expand operations into new regions of the world 
principal growth strategies for our plastics operations include expanding our position in key markets  cross selling to customers of other leggett divisions  and supplying more of the company s internal requirements 
overview of the aluminum products segment segment groups business units aluminum products aluminum die casting tool die our aluminum products segment is the leading independent producer of non automotive aluminum die castings in north america 
we also produce zinc and magnesium die castings 
we work with customers from the design concept stage to market introduction and then through the product lifecycle to refine the product and reduce cost 
we sell aluminum  zinc and magnesium die cast components to a diverse group of customers that manufacture industrial and consumer products 
our customers include small engine and diesel engine builders motorcycle  truck  off road and recreational vehicle including all terrain vehicles and snowmobiles and automobile makers manufacturers of outdoor lighting fixtures  cable line amplifiers  wireless communications systems and other cable and telecommunication products gas barbeque grill manufacturers consumer appliance and power tool manufacturers computer  electronic and electric motor producers we also manufacture and refurbish dies also known as molds or tools for all types and sizes of die casting machines 
these are sold to customers that buy our die castings and to other die cast manufacturers 
we also provide extensive machining  coating  finishing  sub assembly and other value added services related to our die cast components 
as planned  in december we completed construction of our new die casting facility in auburn  alabama 
this facility is scheduled to supply aluminum components for briggs stratton under a seven year agreement 
we expect the facility to be fully operational by the end of key strategies market share growth is a major focus 
we plan to continue to pursue large users of castings  target customers who currently make some of their own aluminum components  and look for opportunities to expand into new markets where die cast components are used 
we plan to continue striving to develop technology that 
table of contents allows opportunities for growth in new markets 
finally  we are committed to establishing a global presence  enabling us to supply customers as they take more production overseas 
acquisitions may play a part in accomplishing these plans 
overview of the industrial materials segment segment groups business units industrial materials wire wire drawing wire products steel rod tubing steel tubing the industrial materials segment produces steel rod  drawn wire and welded steel tubing  as well as specialty wire products 
drawn wire and welded steel tubing are important raw materials that are widely used to manufacture our products 
about of the drawn wire and about of the welded steel tubing that we produce is used to manufacture other products made by the company 
for example  wire is used to make bedding and furniture components commercial fixtures and point of purchase displays automotive seating components welded steel tubing is used in many of the same products including motion furniture mechanisms store fixtures  displays  shelving and storage products automotive seat frames atv  rv and snowmobile accessories in addition to supplying a portion of our own raw material needs  we sell drawn wire and welded steel tubing to a diverse group of industrial customers  including bedding and furniture makers automotive seating manufacturers lawn and garden equipment manufacturers recreational equipment eg atv and rv producers mechanical spring makers we also produce specialty wire products such as wire ties used by cotton gins to tie bales of cotton wire tying heads used by waste recyclers and solid waste removal businesses to bale materials shaped wire used by automotive companies and medical supply businesses currently  our wire mills use over  tons of steel rod each year 
our steel rod mill provides a consistent supply of quality steel rod for the industrial materials segment 
as of year end  we completed an expansion of the mill that is expected to increase future output by approximately  raising annual rod output from  tons to approximately  tons 
we expect to use nearly all of this steel rod in leggett wire mills 
this expansion does not signify a change in our rod strategy 
we expect to continue to be a substantial 
table of contents purchaser of rod on the open market  enabling us to maintain leverage with suppliers 
we strive to maintain the efficiency of the mill by producing only a few sizes and types of rod  and operating the mill s electric furnace which has a capacity of about one million tons during off peak times to reduce energy costs 
also  the mill is located in a region that generates a significant amount of steel scrap 
we expect that over the long term this scrap market will provide a consistent supply to the mill 
finally  the rod mill is also located near our wire mills 
key strategies the core strategy of our wire and tubing businesses is to efficiently supply other leggett businesses raw material requirements 
we expect growth  to a large extent  to occur as our internal requirements expand  both domestically and abroad 
we also expect to expand our capabilities to add value through the forming  shaping  and welding of our wire and tubing 
this may occur through start up operations or acquisitions 
as part of the previously referenced restructuring plan and closure and consolidation initiative  we have identified five facilities in the industrial materials segment that will be consolidated  sold  or closed 
for further information on our restructuring plan  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation beginning on page overview of the specialized products segment segment groups business units specialized products automotive automotive machinery machinery commercial vehicle products commercial vehicle products effective october   the company created the commercial vehicle products group in the specialized products segment following the acquisition of america s body company 
abc s main product categories include van interiors the racks  shelving  cabinets  etc 
installed in service vans and truck bodies for cargo vans  flatbed trucks  service trucks and dump trucks 
the company s existing commercial vehicle products unit  which primarily sells wire and steel racks  shelves and cabinets for the interior of service vans and utility vehicles  is reported in this form k in the commercial fixturing components segment but was moved to the new commercial vehicle products group in the specialized products segment effective january  our specialized products segment designs  produces and sells components for the automotive industry  specialized machinery and equipment  and van interiors and truck bodies for light to medium duty commercial trucks 
in the automotive group  we manufacture lumbar systems for automotive seating including manual  way power  way power  massage systems and memory options seat suspension systems automotive control cables  such as shift cables  cruise control cables  seat belt cables  accelerator cables  seat control cables and latch release cables stamped seat frames and formed metal parts primary customers for these products are automobile seating manufacturers 

table of contents in the machinery group  we primarily manufacture highly automated quilting machines for fabrics used to cover mattresses and other home furnishings machines used to shape wire into various types of springs industrial sewing machines material handling systems wide format digital printing equipment other equipment for factory automation the primary customers for these products are bedding manufacturers 
we also design and produce some of these specialized products for our own use 
in the commercial vehicle products group we primarily manufacture van interiors the racks  shelving  cabinets  etc 
installed in service vans truck bodies for cargo vans  flatbed trucks  service trucks  and dump trucks the primary customers for these products are manufacturers and end users of light to medium duty commercial trucks 
key strategies in our automotive group  we plan to continue the focus on research and development  looking for ways to improve the function and reduce the cost of our products 
the introduction of new capabilities and products creates the potential for us to expand into new markets 
growing our global presence to serve developing markets and to expand our sourcing options will remain a key objective  as will assisting our customers with vendor consolidation to reduce the complexity and cost of their supply chain 
our machinery group designs and manufactures equipment that is used to produce the proprietary innersprings we develop for our bedding customers 
in most cases  this equipment is not available in the marketplace 
providing proprietary machinery is a critical function of our machinery group  and a key factor contributing to the success of our bedding operations 
in addition  we expect to continue to develop technology to improve efficiency in our own plants as well as those of our customers 
in our new commercial vehicle products group  geographic expansion and new product development are key growth strategies 
certain markets for truck bodies in the united states are supplied by smaller regional manufacturers 
we aim to expand into those markets which have high concentrations of end users 
through a continued focus on product innovation  we expect to provide improved product functionality and quality to customers 
as part of the previously referenced restructuring plan and closure and consolidation initiative we have identified five facilities in the specialized products segment that will be consolidated  sold or closed 
for further information on our restructuring plan  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation beginning on page acquisitions and divestitures our typical acquisition is a small  private  profitable  entrepreneurial company 
our acquisition targets are generally complementary to our existing businesses 
over the past ten years  the average acquisition target has had annual revenues between and million  which we believe makes the risk from any single acquisition 
table of contents low 
in our history  we have completed only five acquisitions of businesses with annual sales greater than million 
we do not follow a fixed timetable for buying companies 
rather  we aim to be opportunistic by taking advantage of circumstances as they arise 
as a result  the pace and size of acquisitions in any given year could be significantly more or less than the average over the longer term 
in total  we acquired businesses during representing approximately million in annualized sales 
the acquired businesses are expected to add approximate annualized sales within our segments as follows residential furnishings million specialized products million the largest of these acquisitions  america s body company was acquired in late october and is expected to generate annual revenue of approximately million 
abc s main product categories include van interiors the racks  shelving  cabinets  etc 
installed in service vans and truck bodies for cargo vans  flatbed trucks  service trucks  and dump trucks 
this acquisition provided the basis to create our newly formed commercial vehicle products group in the specialized products segment 
as of january  our van interior operations were combined with abc  consolidating the commercial vehicle products group within the specialized products segment 
with combined expected sales of approximately million  we believe we are now the second largest supplier  in terms of revenue  in a billion us market 
while the industry is fragmented  containing many small  regional manufacturers  we believe that only a few competitors provide as wide a range of products and service locations 
in another key expansion  we acquired two geo components operations in that are expected to collectively add approximately million in revenue annually to the residential furnishings segment 
these acquisitions expanded our presence in converting and distributing geo components 
geo components include geotextiles  or synthetic fabrics used in a variety of applications such as ground stabilization  drainage protection  erosion control and weed control 
products are sold primarily into the construction  landscaping and agriculture industries 
the fragmented us market for geotextiles is estimated at million annually and contains many small regional suppliers 
we also divested a total of four businesses in with aggregate annualized sales of million 
in our residential furnishings segment we sold a wiping cloth business with annual sales of approximately million 
we also sold a small automotive cable producer in our specialized products segment 
finally  we sold assets relating to the production of stud wall fixture partitions and slotted wall displays  which were a part of the commercial fixturing components segment

foreign operations the percentages of our trade sales from products manufactured outside the united states for the previous three years are shown in the table below 
year percent 
table of contents the majority of our international operations  measured by trade sales  are in canada  europe and mexico 
the canadian operations manufacture products including innersprings for mattresses  fabricated wire for the bedding  furniture and automotive industries  cut to size bed frame lumber and down comforters  mattress pads and pillows 
we manufacture shelving for retailers  wire and steel storage systems and racks for the interior of service vans and utility vehicles  and point of purchase displays for retailers  as well as chair frames and bases  table bases and office chair controls  and plastic injection moldings 
we also make lumbar supports for automotive seats 
our operations in europe produce  among other things  innersprings for mattresses  structural fabric for industrial and residential uses  various wire products  and lumbar and seat suspension systems for automotive seating 
we also sell machinery and equipment designed to manufacture innersprings for mattresses and other bedding related components 
finally  we have one operation in europe that designs and distributes point of purchase displays for retailers 
the mexican operations manufacture products including innersprings and wire grid tops for mattresses  fabricated wire for the bedding industry  and structural fabric for industrial and residential uses 
we produce aluminum die castings and provide machining  sub assembly and other value added services related to aluminum die castings 
we also produce commercial shelving  material handling equipment  and automotive control cable systems 
we continue to increase our presence in asia  particularly in china where we now have production facilities 
prior to  we owned only three production facilities in china 
two of these plants produce mattress innersprings for sale into the chinese market 
the third plant produces machinery and replacement parts for machines used in the bedding industry 
in  we increased to eight total chinese operations 
we began operations in our fourth plant  a facility to manufacture recliner mechanisms and various bases for upholstered furniture 
this plant primarily sells products to furniture manufacturers in china who produce upholstered furniture for export and to some leggett operations on an inter company basis 
the other four chinese operations added in include a facility that produces small electric motors primarily used in lumbar systems for automotive seating  a facility that manufactures cables for these lumbar systems  an operation that produces innersprings for mattresses and sofa cushions  and a facility that manufactures innersprings and bedding machinery 
in  we continued growing our presence in china with two acquisitions 
one operation  in our residential furnishings segment  manufactures chair components 
in our fixture display group  we added a manufacturer of retail store fixtures and gondola shelving 
in addition to these acquisitions  we bought assets and placed them into an existing location to create a manufacturer of stamped seat frames and formed metal automotive products in our automotive group 
finally  our ornamental bed unit imports finished beds from asia for sale in the united states 
many other business units of the company have long standing  well established relationships with suppliers in asia for components and finished products 
our strategy regarding international expansion is to locate our operations where we believe demand for components is growing 
in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas  we need to be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
in addition  these operations should allow us to supply growing demand in the local markets 
our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign state 
these risks include the nationalization of private enterprises political instability in certain countries 
table of contents differences in foreign laws that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights credit risks increased costs due to tariffs  customs and shipping rates potential problems obtaining raw materials  and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war foreign currency fluctuation such risks could result in increases in costs  reduction in profits  the inability to do business and other adverse effects on the company s business

table of contents sales by product line the following table shows the approximate percentages of our sales to external customers by product line for the last three years product line bedding components residential furniture components finished consumer products other residential furnishing products store displays  fixtures storage products office furnishings plastic components aluminum products wire  wire products steel tubing automotive products  specialized machinery commercial vehicle products distribution of products in each of our segments  our products are sold and distributed primarily through the company s sales personnel 
however  many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with sales representatives and distributors 
we do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would  if terminated  have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the company 
raw materials we use a variety of raw materials in manufacturing our products 
some of the most important raw materials include steel scrap steel rod coil and sheet steel angle iron aluminum steel wire woven and non woven fabrics foam chemicals and foam scrap textile scrap plastic resin rough green lumber the raw materials for many of our businesses are supplied by our own facilities 
for example  steel rod is used to produce steel wire  which we use to make innersprings and foundations for mattresses  springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas  displays  shelving and racks for retailers  and automotive seating components 
our own wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our us requirements for steel wire 
the steel rod produced at our rod mill currently supplies roughly half of our rod requirements 
after the expansion of the rod mill and full ramp up discussed further on page  we expect to produce approximately two thirds of our steel rod requirements 
we also produce welded steel tubing  dimension lumber and plastic components both for our own consumption and for sale to customers outside the company 

table of contents we believe that worldwide supply sources are available for all the raw materials used by the company 
however  we have experienced higher raw material costs most notably steel and oil based materials such as chemicals  fibers and resins during the past two years 
we purchase about million tons of steel annually  accounting for approximately of our cost of goods sold 
in  inflation caused the company to pay over million more for steel than it did in most steel vendors rescinded previous contracts  and moved to day pricing 
the company announced or implemented steel related price increases in most segments 
in  market prices for most types of steel were slightly lower at the end of the year than at the beginning of the year 
although the company anticipates the costs for steel to stabilize  the future pricing of steel is uncertain and could increase in the degree to which we are able to mitigate or recover higher costs  should they occur  could be a significant factor influencing earnings 
the price increases in the steel market during led to an above average spread between scrap costs and rod prices 
this spread continued throughout  enhancing the earnings of our rod mill 
we expect that the spread between the price of steel rod and steel scrap will narrow in if this occurs  it will negatively impact our results of operations 
we experienced significant inflation in chemicals  fibers and resins generally driven by changes in oil prices throughout  but especially in the last half of the year 
by year end  the majority of these cost increases had been passed through to our customers 
in addition to steel and oil based materials  we also use significant amounts of aluminum 
however  we are generally less exposed to cost changes in this commodity because of the pricing arrangements we have with our customers 
heading into the fourth quarter of  the availability of tdi  a chemical used to make polyurethane foam  was a concern 
overall industry capacity had been reduced early in the summer by the closure of two tdi plants and then hurricane damage to major chemical  refinery and natural gas facilities disrupted the production of tdi 
these shortages abated by year end and we experienced no significant volume reductions 
in  higher raw material costs led some of our customers to modify their product designs  changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods 
in some cases  our higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components  causing us to shift production accordingly 
this has impacted our residential furnishings product mix and decreased profit margins 
we expect that this will continue to be an issue in and could negatively impact our results of operations 
customers we serve thousands of customers worldwide  sustaining many long term business relationships 
no customer accounted for more than of the company s consolidated revenues in our top customers accounted for less than of our consolidated revenues in the commercial fixturing components segment has one customer whose sales exceeded of total segment sales 
this customer accounted for approximately of the segment s sales 
aluminum products has one such customer  which accounted for approximately of the segment s sales  as well as two customers who account for just under each 
the specialized products segment has three customers with sales exceeding of total segment sales 
these customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of the segment s sales 
the loss of any one of these customers may have a material adverse effect upon the relevant segment 
patents and trademarks leggett holds approximately  patents and has approximately in process for its various product lines 
we have registered over trademarks  with more than in process 
no single patent or group of patents  or trademark or group of trademarks  is material to our business as a whole 
most of our patents and 
table of contents trademarks relate to products sold in the specialized products and residential furnishings segments 
examples of our most significant trademarks include semi flex  lok fast and dyna lock boxspring components and foundations mira coil  lura flex and superlastic mattress innersprings nova bond and rollout insulator pads for mattresses adjustamagic adjustable electric beds wall hugger recliner chair mechanisms super sagless motion and sofa sleeper mechanisms no sag wire forms used in seating tack jump and pattern link quilting machines hanes fiber materials schukra  pullmaflex and flex o lators automotive seating products amco and rhc fixtures and displays spuhl mattress innerspring manufacturing machines gribetz and porter quilting and sewing machines abc america s body co  quietflex and masterack equipment and accessories for vans and trucks research and development we maintain research  engineering and testing centers in carthage  missouri  and also do research and development work at many of our other facilities 
we are unable to precisely calculate the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas 
however  we estimate the cost of research and development was approximately million in  million in  and million in employees the company has approximately  active employees  of which approximately  are engaged in production 
of the total active employees  roughly  are international employees 
approximately  of our employees were represented by labor unions 
we did not experience any material work stoppage related to the negotiation of contracts with labor unions during management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to the negotiation of contracts with labor unions during the largest group of employees  approximately  works in the residential furnishings segment 
approximately  employees work in commercial fixturing components  while approximately  employees work in specialized products 
roughly  work in the aluminum products segment and approximately  are employed by our industrial materials segment 
competition many companies offer products that compete with those manufactured and sold by leggett 
the number of competing companies varies by product line  but the markets for our products are highly competitive in all aspects 
the primary competitive factors in our business include price  product quality  innovation  and customer service 

table of contents we believe we gain a competitive advantage over many competitors by having lower cost operations  significant internal production of key raw materials  superior manufacturing expertise and product innovation  higher quality products  extensive customer service capabilities  long lived relationships with customers  and greater financial strength 
in certain of our markets  a portion of us manufacturing is moving overseas 
we face increasing price competition from foreign competitors  especially those in asia  who are able to supply component parts to our customers chinese and asian manufacturing facilities 
we have  and continue to develop  significant asian supply sources 
we also have  and continue to develop  a manufacturing presence in asia 
when prices for key raw materials such as steel  aluminum and chemicals are relatively level throughout the world  we can generally produce our components at a lower cost in the us because many of our products have low labor content 
however  in instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas  our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
at the end of  we operated facilities in china 
we believe asian manufacturers currently benefit from lower commodity costs certain commodities may sometimes be subsidized by asian governments  lenient attitudes toward safety and environmental matters  and currency rates that are pegged to the us dollar rather than free floating 
however  when exporting to the us  asian manufacturers must overcome higher transportation costs and increased working capital needs  and may have difficulty matching us manufacturers level of service  flexibility and logistics 
we believe we are the largest independent manufacturer in north america  in terms of revenue  of the following components for residential furniture and bedding retail store fixtures and point of purchase displays components for office furniture non automotive aluminum die castings drawn steel wire automotive seat support and lumbar systems carpet underlay adjustable beds bedding industry machinery for wire forming  sewing and quilting seasonality we do not experience significant seasonality  however  quarter to quarter sales have generally varied in proportion to the total year by about 
the timing of acquisitions and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses 
nevertheless  for the company as a whole  the second and third quarters typically have proportionately greater sales  while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower 
residential furnishings typically has the strongest sales in the second and third quarters due to increased consumer demand for bedding and furniture during the late summer and fall months 
commercial fixturing and components generally has heavy third quarter sales of its store fixture products  with the first and fourth quarters normally lower 
this aligns with the industry s normal construction cycle  and the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season 
aluminum products sales are proportionately greater in the first two calendar quarters due to typically stronger spring and early summer demand for lawn and garden equipment and barbeque grills 
industrial materials and specialized products have 
table of contents relatively little quarter to quarter variation in sales  although the automotive business is somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and somewhat lower in the third quarter  due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer 
backlog our relationships with our customers and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not provide for a significant backlog of orders 
production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projections of future demand based on customer relationships 
working capital items for information regarding working capital items  see the discussion of cash from operations in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  on page environmental regulation the company s various operations are subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment 
environmental regulations include those relating to air and water emissions  underground storage tanks  waste handling  and the like 
we have established policies in an effort to ensure that our operations are conducted in keeping with good corporate citizenship and with a positive commitment to the protection of the natural and workplace environments

risk factors investing in our securities involves risk 
set forth below and elsewhere in this report are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking and other statements contained in this report 
we may amend or supplement these risk factors from time to time by other reports we file with the sec in the future 
costs of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results 
raw material cost increases and our ability to respond to cost increases through selling price increases can significantly impact our earnings 
steel is our largest raw material 
during the price of certain types of steel nearly doubled 
in  market prices for most types of steel were slightly lower at the end of the year than at the beginning of the year 
although we anticipate the costs for steel to stabilize  the future pricing of steel is uncertain and could increase in even beyond current levels 

table of contents the price increases in the steel market during led to an above average spread between scrap costs and rod prices 
this spread continued throughout  enhancing the earnings of our rod mill 
we expect that the spread between the price of steel rod and steel scrap will narrow in if this occurs  it will negatively impact our results of operations 
our operations can also be impacted by other raw materials  including those affected by changes in oil prices  such as chemicals  fibers and resins  as well as aluminum and lumber 
throughout  but particularly in the last half of the year  we experienced higher costs associated with the oil based raw materials 
we may not be able to pass along future cost increases through selling price increases 
in  higher raw material costs led some of our customers to modify their product designs  changing the quantity and mix of our components in their finished goods 
in some cases  our higher cost components were replaced with lower cost components 
this has impacted our residential furnishings product mix and decreased profit margins 
we expect this to continue to be an issue in and could negatively impact our results of operations 
we may not be able to improve operating performance in our fixture display group 
our fixture display group has experienced deterioration in profitability in recent years 
we were hampered in our efforts to improve operating margins in by new program start up costs and integration inefficiencies associated with the rhc spacemaster acquisition 
in september  we announced a restructuring plan where eight facilities in the fixture display group have been or will be consolidated  sold  or closed 
we have estimated that our fixture display group productive capacity will be reduced by approximately million pursuant to the restructuring plan 
if margins do not improve in the fixture display group  we may incur further charges as we pursue additional restructuring activities in this group 
for further information on our restructuring plan  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation beginning on page asian competition could adversely affect our operating results 
we operate in markets that are highly competitive 
depending on the particular product  we experience competition based on a number of factors  including quality  performance  price and availability 
we face increasing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished product from asia 
if we are unable to purchase key raw materials  such as steel  aluminum and chemicals  at prices competitive with those of foreign suppliers  our ability to maintain market share and profit margins could likewise be harmed 
also  if our customers move production of their finished products overseas  we believe that our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently  which is particularly true in china 
at the end of  we operated facilities in china 
if demand in china and other foreign countries increases at a more rapid rate than we are able to establish operations in these countries  our market share and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
we may fail to meet our acquisition growth goals 
one of our growth strategies is to increase our sales and earnings and expand our markets through acquisitions 
in the company acquired businesses  including the third largest acquisition in our history in terms of revenue 
we expect these acquisitions to add approximately million in annual revenue 

table of contents furthermore  we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future when appropriate opportunities arise 
however  we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions that are sufficient to meet our goals 
further  our acquired companies may encounter unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources  which would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
our operating results may be adversely affected if we do not achieve our acquisition growth goals 
higher energy costs could adversely affect our operating results 
higher prices for natural gas  electricity and fuel increase our production and delivery costs 
many of our large manufacturing operations are heavy users of natural gas and electricity 
in addition  certain of our sales are made with terms such that we incur the fuel cost associated with delivering the product to our customer s facility 
energy costs increased throughout but especially in the last half of the year  in part due to supply disruptions caused by hurricanes 
our inability to respond to these cost increases by raising selling prices could negatively affect our operating results 
we have exposure to economic factors that may affect market demand for our products 
as a supplier of products to a variety of industries  we are adversely affected by general economic downturns 
our operating performance is heavily influenced by market demand for our components and products 
this market demand is impacted by many broad economic factors  including consumer confidence  employment levels  housing turnover  energy costs and interest rates 
these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and therefore drive demand for our components and products 
some of these factors also influence the level of business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
significant changes in these economic factors may negatively impact the demand for our products and our results of operations 
our assets are subject to potential goodwill impairment 
a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
as of december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately billion  or of our total assets 
we test goodwill and other assets for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist 
we could be required to recognize reductions in our net income caused by the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  which  if significant  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
as disclosed above  our fixture display group has experienced deterioration in profitability compared to historical levels 
we expect that the restructuring plan will lead to improved earnings in the fixture display group 
about million of goodwill is associated with the fixture display group 
if our earnings in this group do not improve  a goodwill impairment charge against earnings may be required 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total sales  which exposes us to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in  of our sales were generated by international operations 
the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies  however  certain of our operations experience currency related gains and losses where sales or purchases are denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
we currently engage in limited currency hedging transactions 
further  our competitive position may be affected by the relative strength of the currencies in countries where our products are sold 
we cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our future operations and financial results

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
highlights for the full year  we posted record sales but earnings declined mainly due to charges associated with our restructuring activities 
sales increased primarily from acquisitions and inflation 
in september  we launched a significant broad based initiative the restructuring plan to reduce excess capacity and improve performance in a number of our businesses 
we made significant progress on the restructuring in the fourth quarter and expect to have most of this activity completed by mid future years earnings should benefit from the cost savings and improved asset utilization this restructuring activity is expected to bring 
acquisition activity increased in as we completed transactions  including the third largest in our history 
these acquisitions should benefit leggett by enhancing our position in current markets  increasing our product offerings and expanding our geographic presence 
our use of cash in was consistent with our stated priorities we funded capital expenditures at levels slightly higher than spending on acquisitions increased due to the size and number of opportunities we brought to completion 
we raised our dividend for the th consecutive year 
cash used for share repurchases increased significantly  we bought back more shares than in any previous year 
cash from operations  our primary source of funds  was significantly higher in than in we also issued debt during the year and increased our percentage of net debt to net capital toward our long term  targeted range 
these topics are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow 
executive overview what we do leggett platt is a fortune diversified manufacturer that conceives  designs  and produces a broad range of engineered components and products that can be found in many homes  retail stores  offices  and automobiles 
we make components that are often hidden within  but integral to  our customers products 
we are north america s leading independent manufacturer of components for residential furniture and bedding  adjustable beds  carpet underlay  retail store fixtures and point of purchase displays  components for office furniture  non automotive aluminum die castings  drawn steel wire  automotive seat support and lumbar systems  and machinery used by the bedding industry for wire forming  sewing  and quilting 

table of contents our segments our year old company is composed of business units under five reportable segments  with approximately  employee partners  and more than facilities located in over countries around the world 
our five segments are residential furnishings  commercial fixturing components  aluminum products  industrial materials  and specialized products 
logo residential furnishings this segment supplies a variety of components mainly used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products 
we also sell adjustable beds  bed frames  ornamental beds  carpet cushion  geo components  and other finished products 
commercial fixturing components operations in this segment produce a store fixtures  point of purchase displays  and storage products used by retailers  b chair controls  bases  and other components for office furniture manufacturers  and c injection molded plastic components used in a variety of end products 
aluminum products this segment provides die cast aluminum components for customers that manufacture many products including motorcycles  diesel and small engines  outdoor lighting fixtures  gas barbeque grills  appliances  power tools  and consumer electronics  among others 
industrial materials these operations primarily supply steel rod  drawn steel wire  and welded steel tubing to other leggett operations and to external customers 
our wire and tubing is used to make bedding  furniture  automotive seats  retail store fixtures and displays  mechanical springs  and many other end products 
specialized products from this segment we supply lumbar systems and wire components used by automotive seating manufacturers 
we design  produce  and sell van interiors the racks  shelving  cabinets  etc 
installed in service vans and truck bodies for cargo vans  flatbed trucks  service trucks  and dump trucks used in light to medium duty commercial trucks 
we also design and produce machinery  both for our own use and for others  including bedding manufacturers 
customers we serve a broad suite of customers  with no single one representing of our sales 
many are companies whose names are widely recognized  they include most manufacturers of furniture  bedding  and automobiles  many major retailers  and a variety of other manufacturers 

table of contents we primarily sell our products through our own sales employees  although we also use independent sales representatives and distributors in some of our businesses 
competition most of our markets are highly competitive with the number of competitors varying by product line they tend to be smaller  private companies 
we believe we gain competitive advantage in our global markets through low cost operations  significant internal production of key raw materials  superior manufacturing expertise and product innovation  higher quality products  extensive customer service capabilities  long lived relationships with customers  and greater financial strength 
many of our competitors  both domestic and foreign  compete primarily on the basis of price 
our success has stemmed from the ability to remain price competitive  while delivering product quality  innovation  and customer service 
we face increasing pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components or finished products from asia 
when prices for key materials such as steel  aluminum  and chemicals are relatively level throughout the world  we can generally produce our components at a lower cost in the us because many of our products have low labor content 
however  in instances where our customers move production of their finished products overseas  our operations must be located nearby to supply them efficiently 
at the end of  leggett operated facilities in china 
asian manufacturers are currently thought to benefit from lower commodity costs we believe certain commodities are sometimes subsidized by asian governments  lenient attitudes toward safety and environmental matters  and currency rates that are pegged to the us dollar rather than free floating 
when exporting to the us  asian manufacturers must overcome higher transportation costs  increased working capital needs  and difficulty matching us manufacturers level of service  flexibility  and logistics 
major factors that impact our business many factors impact our business every year  but those that generally have the greatest impact are market demand for our products  raw material cost trends  energy costs  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in recent years  weak performance by our fixture display operations has also impacted our results 
market demand market demand is impacted by many broad economic factors  including consumer confidence  employment levels  housing turnover  energy costs  and interest rates 
these factors influence consumer spending on durable goods  and therefore affect demand for our components and products 
some of these factors also influence the level of business spending on facilities and equipment  which impacts approximately one quarter of our sales 
market demand can also be affected by inflation in raw materials discussed below when cost increases cause customers to change the design of their products and the type of components they use to offset higher costs 
raw materials in many of our businesses we have a cost advantage from buying large quantities of raw materials 
this purchasing leverage is a benefit that many of our competitors do not enjoy 
still  our costs can vary significantly as market prices for raw materials many of which are commodities increase and decrease 
purchasing arrangements vary considerably across the company 
because we typically have short term commitments from vendors  our raw material costs generally fluctuate with the market 
in certain of our businesses  we have longer term contracts with pricing terms that provide stability under reasonable market conditions 
however  when commodities experience extreme inflation  vendors may not honor those contracts 

table of contents this situation occurred in when steel costs nearly doubled  and again in when the cost of chemicals  fibers  and resins increased significantly 
vendors were unable to honor the pricing terms in purchase contracts due to extreme market conditions 
our ability to recover higher costs through selling price increases is a critical factor when we experience inflation 
we have few long term  fixed pricing contracts with customers 
when we experience significant increases in raw material costs  we implement price increases to recover the higher costs 
although we are generally able to pass through most cost increases  we encounter greater difficulty in businesses where we have a smaller market share and in products that are of a commodity nature 
inability to recover cost increases or a delay in the recovery time can impact our earnings 
steel is our largest raw material 
during  the price of certain types of steel nearly doubled  but we were able to recover most of these higher costs through selling price increases 
in  market prices for most types of steel were slightly lower at the end of the year than at the beginning of the year 
unprecedented price increases in the steel market during led to an above average spread between scrap costs and rod prices 
this spread continued throughout  enhancing the earnings of our steel rod mill 
while we expect the average spread to be lower in  scrap costs have been volatile and the spread is difficult to predict 
in  we experienced significant inflation in chemicals  fibers  and resins generally driven by changes in oil prices 
by year end  the majority of these cost increases had been passed through to our customers 
in addition to steel and oil based materials  we also use significant amounts of aluminum 
however  we are generally less exposed to cost changes in this commodity because of the pricing arrangements we have with our customers 
energy costs higher prices for natural gas  electricity  and fuel increase our production and delivery costs 
many of our large manufacturing operations are heavy users of natural gas and electricity 
in addition  certain of our sales are made with terms such that we incur the fuel cost associated with delivering the product to our customer s facility 
our ability to respond to these cost increases by raising selling prices affects our operating results 
higher energy costs can also reduce consumer demand for our products 
as consumers pay more for fuel and utilities  they have less disposable income available to purchase products that contain our components 
energy costs increased throughout but especially in the last half of the year  in part due to supply disruptions caused by the hurricanes 
we continuously monitor natural gas trends and have locked in prices on a portion of our natural gas requirements for the next three years 
the details of those arrangements are discussed in note p to the financial statements on page 
foreign currency as we expand internationally  our exposure to foreign currencies grows 
our greatest exposures are currently to the canadian dollar and the euro 
we occasionally use various types of contracts  options  and other arrangements to mitigate some of this exposure 
the details of these arrangements are also discussed in note p to the financial statements on page 
however  since these arrangements are used on a limited basis  our earnings are generally impacted by variability in the currency exchanges rates of countries where we operate 
in recent years  we ve been particularly impacted by the weakening of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar 
in certain operations  we incur costs in canadian dollars and sell products in us dollars 
the decline of the us dollar in recent years has reduced earnings of these operations 

table of contents fixture display performance two years ago  we initiated an effort to improve the performance of the commercial segment and specifically the fixture display operations 
we made progress in  as commercial segment margins improved to from in 
we expected further improvement in but it did not occur 
excluding restructuring  asset impairment  and inventory obsolescence charges  commercial segment margins in were essentially unchanged from those of in  benefits from our prior cost savings initiatives were offset by higher start up costs associated with new fixture programs and operating inefficiencies related to the ongoing integration of rhc spacemaster a company we acquired in july 
we re committed to improving the segment margins and expect to accomplish gains through our current restructuring efforts 
however  earnings must improve appreciably from current levels or further restructuring may be initiated 
restructuring and asset impairments in  we incurred restructuring related and asset impairment charges totaling million  compared to million in  and million in through june   the level of restructuring activity was not unusual 
however in the third quarter  we launched a significant broad based restructuring project restructuring plan to reduce excess capacity and improve performance in a number of our businesses 
we had maintained spare capacity for several years expecting market demand to increase but that incremental demand has not materialized 
we made significant progress on the restructuring plan activities by year end 
as part of the restructuring plan  we identified underutilized or underperforming facilities to be closed  consolidated  or sold the closure and consolidation initiative 
we also took a more critical look at other underperforming operations  as a result  we modified or accelerated restructuring activities that were previously underway  and identified other operations with impaired assets 
total expenses associated with the restructuring plan should approximate million  of which about half will be non cash charges 
this estimate includes the cost of plant closures building cleanup and repair  equipment relocation  employee severance pay  asset impairment  inventory obsolescence  and similar expenses 
we incurred million of these costs in and expect to incur the remaining million in  primarily in the first half of the year 
these estimates do not include future benefits from the sales of buildings  real estate  or equipment  so our final net costs will be lower 
more detail regarding the breakdown of these charges is shown below 
amount cash non cash dollar amounts in millions restructuring charges asset impairment charges inventory obsolescence and other costs closure consolidation initiative costs related to other activity costs for restructuring plan expected costs for restructuring plan total anticipated restructuring plan costs of the facilities under the closure and consolidation initiative  about half are in residential furnishings  one quarter are in commercial fixturing components  and the remainder are in industrial materials and specialized products 
these operations had total revenue of roughly million 
most of this volume should shift to surviving facilities  but a million sales reduction is expected as we divest small  non core operations and walk away from unprofitable business 
the majority of this volume reduction should occur in the residential and commercial segments 
we have determined which of our remaining locations will absorb displaced volume  and are addressing issues related to relocating equipment  inventory  and customer service 

table of contents we estimate an ongoing annual pre tax earnings benefit from the restructuring plan of approximately million 
at least half of this improvement should be realized in with the full benefit expected in subsequent years 
this benefit results from the elimination of fixed costs associated with closed facilities  a reduction in the number of employees  and improved overhead absorption from increased volume at our remaining facilities 
the restructuring plan should yield improved margins and returns in all segments 
about one half of the expected benefit should occur in residential furnishings  of the benefit should impact commercial fixturing components  and approximately of the benefit should occur in each of our other three segments 
acquisitions we completed acquisitions in that should add about million to annual sales 
the two largest  america s body company and ikex jarex  establish sizeable new business platforms with opportunities for future growth 
america s body company abc  was acquired in late october and generates annual revenue of approximately million this is the third largest acquisition in our history 
abc is a designer  manufacturer  and supplier of equipment for light to medium duty commercial trucks 
major product categories include van interiors racks  shelving  and cabinets installed in service vans and truck bodies for cargo vans  flatbed trucks  service trucks  and dump trucks 
this business joined our existing van interiors operations to form the commercial vehicle products group in our specialized products segment 
with combined group sales of approximately million  we are now the second largest supplier in a billion us market 
while the industry is highly fragmented and contains many small  regional manufacturers  only a few competitors provide as wide a range of products and service locations 
through the acquisition of ikex jarex  we significantly expanded our presence in the conversion and distribution of geo components 
this transaction was completed in early october and should add roughly million in revenue  bringing our total annual sales in this business unit to approximately million this business unit is in our residential furnishings segment 
geo components include geotextiles  or synthetic fabrics typically polypropylene  polyethylene  or polyester used in a variety of applications such as ground stabilization  drainage protection  erosion control and weed control 
these products are sold primarily into the construction  landscaping  and agricultural industries 
the highly fragmented us market for geotextiles is believed to approximate million annually  consisting mostly of small  regional suppliers 
this acquisition should enhance our competitive position in the geo component market through national presence  high volume purchasing and manufacturing  and established distribution and marketing infrastructure 
we provide additional details about acquisitions in note b to the financial statements on page results of operations vs 
we achieved record sales in  exceeding the prior year by 
earnings for the year decreased primarily due to restructuring  asset impairment  and inventory obsolescence charges related to the restructuring plan 
inflation was a challenge during the year  primarily in oil based raw materials  but by year end we had recovered most of these higher costs through selling price increases 
further details about these items and our consolidated and segment results are discussed below 

table of contents consolidated results the following table shows the changes in sales and earnings from to and identifies the major factors contributing to the changes amount dollar amounts in millions  except per share data net sales year ended december  acquisition sales growth net of divestitures internal sales growth year ended december  net earnings year ended december  restructuring related charges higher workers compensation expense lower tax rate increased sales and other year ended december  earnings per share december  earnings per share december  internal growth and acquisitions each contributed about half the net sales increase 
internal sales growth ie excluding acquisitions and divestitures was mainly due to inflation we implemented price increases to recover higher raw material costs 
these increases related primarily to higher costs for steel early in the year versus lower levels in early and for chemicals  fibers  and resins throughout by late  steel costs had declined versus peak levels in the last half of and we experienced modest deflation in a few businesses 
unit volumes were mixed across our various markets 
for the full year  we posted solid growth in our businesses supplying upholstered furniture components  but these gains were offset by declines in our bedding and automotive businesses 
volume was essentially flat in many of our other markets 
these trends are discussed in the segment results below 
inflation was a significant challenge again in the largest impact resulted from higher oil prices which affect the cost of raw materials such as chemicals  fibers  and resins 
many of these costs rose throughout the year  but the increases accelerated following last year s hurricanes 
in response  we raised prices to our customers  and by year end had recovered most of the higher costs 
net earnings and earnings per share decreased versus primarily due to restructuring related charges as shown in the table above  restructuring related charges represent the majority of the decrease in earnings 
these charges include the cost of plant closures  equipment relocation  employee severance pay  asset impairment  inventory obsolescence  and other similar costs associated with the restructuring plan discussed on page higher workers compensation expense in  we significantly increased our reserves for workers compensation to reflect higher cost of medical care and longer duration of claims more treatment options are available and can continue over longer periods of time 
earnings were also affected by higher energy and transportation costs  and a weaker us dollar which caused margin declines in our canadian operations that sell in us dollars but incur costs in canadian dollars 

table of contents these declines were partially offset by benefits from sales growth and a tax benefit from a planned foreign entity restructuring and cash repatriation transaction 
this transaction generated a net tax benefit of approximately million 
segment results in the following section we discuss sales and earnings before interest and taxes ebit for each of our segments 
a reconciliation of segment ebit to consolidated ebit is provided in note l to the financial statements on page all of our segments use the first in  first out fifo method for valuing inventory 
in  segment margins generally benefited under the fifo method from the effect of rising commodity costs 
in  declining steel costs caused margins mainly in residential and industrial to decrease under this same method 
in our consolidated financials  we use the last in  first out lifo method for determining cost of about half of our inventories 
an adjustment is made at the corporate level ie outside the segments to convert the appropriate operations to the lifo inventory method 
residential furnishings sales ebit ebit margins dollar amounts in millions year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease internal sales growth acquisition sales growth sales in residential furnishings increased in from a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
inflation contributed the bulk of the internal sales growth 
during the first half of  sales increased over last year due to price increases for the pass through of higher steel costs implemented in the latter part of in the last half of  declining steel costs which were also passed through to our customers resulted in slight deflation in certain businesses 
when combined  these price related factors led to higher full year sales 
unit volume declines and changes in product mix partially offset sales growth from inflation in unit volumes were down slightly  with decreases in bedding more than offsetting gains in upholstered furniture components 
in addition  inflation in the raw materials used to produce finished bedding and upholstered furniture has  in certain cases  led our customers to change their product design  which has reduced the quantity and changed the mix of components they buy from us 
market demand for bedding was weak for much of the year  but began to improve in early september and continued on a positive track through year end 
for the past few years  bedding industry unit volume  including all types of mattresses  has been flat to slightly down 
overall consumer spending has been solid  but consumers have not been purchasing or replacing mattresses at historic rates 
bedding purchases are deferrable and are influenced by consumer confidence and the amount of cash consumers have available to spend on discretionary items 
higher gasoline and energy costs as seen throughout reduce this discretionary spending 
in addition  advertising expenditures by bedding manufacturers have also been lower in recent years 
as the cost of materials such as steel components and foam increased significantly  these manufacturers cut expenditures in other areas including advertising 
lower advertising levels negatively impact consumer demand for bedding 

table of contents for the full year  we posted solid growth in our businesses supplying upholstered furniture components 
we sell to most manufacturers of motion upholstered furniture 
these customers include major public furniture producers as well as privately owned manufacturers 
we also benefit from increased world wide demand 
our international presence and depth of product line allow us to efficiently supply upholstered furniture manufacturers in many parts of the world 
in addition  we ve benefited from an industry trend to incorporate high quality motion features into more lines of furniture 
our consistent growth in this business since reflects all these factors

foreign currency rate changes also added to internal sales growth  but to a much lesser extent than inflation and unit volume gains 
rising steel costs were our largest challenge in we purchase roughly million tons of steel each year  accounting for about of our cost of goods sold 
during  prices increased significantly  and for the year we paid over million more for steel than in due to the magnitude of these increases  we were compelled to pass along our higher costs 
we experienced inflation in other raw materials during chemical  fiber  and resin costs increased as oil prices rose 
aluminum costs also increased  but our earnings exposure to this commodity is currently limited by the pricing arrangements we have with our customers 
net earnings and earnings per share also increased versus with several factors contributing to the improvement sales increase internal sales growth was the primary factor behind s earnings improvement 
higher unit volumes led to improved overhead absorption in many of our businesses 
in addition  prior years plant consolidations and cost cutting helped lower our fixed costs and allowed us to utilize capacity more efficiently as volume increased 
selling and administrative expenses increased at a slower rate than sales  also benefiting earnings 

table of contents gains from our steel rod mill earnings benefited in from full production at our steel rod mill 
operating efficiency improved significantly year over year since we were ramping up production in in addition  we benefited from an above average market spread between scrap costs and rod selling prices 
improvements in our fixture display operations steps taken under the fixture display tactical plan contributed to the earnings growth we saw in earnings also benefited from gains related to the sale of buildings  lower inventory obsolescence  and a lower income tax rate 
the income tax rate fell from in to in  due to our mix of domestic and foreign income and certain one time factors 
these benefits were partially offset by impacts from a weaker us dollar and slightly higher costs associated with plant closings and consolidations 
the us dollar weakened in  causing margin declines in our canadian operations that sell in us dollars but incur their costs in canadian dollars 
residential furnishings sales ebit ebit margins dollar amounts in millions year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease internal sales growth acquisition sales growth sales in residential furnishings increased in  with more than half the internal growth coming from inflation 
unit volumes gains were strongest in upholstered furniture components and carpet underlay  but these improvements were mitigated slightly by approximately flat world wide bedding demand 
in  we posted double digit  world wide unit sales growth in mechanisms for upholstered furniture 
we benefited from market share gains as our customers gain share  an industry trend to incorporate motion components into more lines of upholstered furniture  and a well established international presence 
world wide demand for bedding components was strong in early  but moderated in the second and third quarters  and declined in the fourth quarter primarily from weakness in the us market 
we believe that reduced advertising expenditures by bedding manufacturers during the fourth quarter led to less promotion by retailers and  in turn  lower demand for bedding 
in early  most bedding manufacturers implemented price increases to recover the higher costs they were absorbing late in earnings before interest and taxes ebit also increased versus and ebit margins improved 
gains came from sales growth  which resulted in higher utilization rates and improved overhead absorption in certain businesses prior cost reduction and plant consolidation efforts selling price increases  primarily to recover escalating steel costs gains related to the sale of buildings no longer used in operations million these improvements were partially offset by higher raw material costs  the impact of a weaker us dollar primarily versus the canadian dollar approximately million  and modest charges associated with plant closings and consolidations million 

table of contents commercial fixturing components sales ebit ebit margins dollar amounts in millions year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease internal sales growth acquisition sales growth for the full year  acquisitions accounted for the bulk of the sales increase 
internal sales growth came from inflation  but was partially offset by a decline in unit volumes 
slight unit declines in our fixture display operations were partially offset by mid single digit unit growth in our office furniture components businesses 
weak demand for store fixtures reflected the continued reluctance on the part of many retailers to increase spending for construction of new stores and renovation of existing stores 
the gains in office furniture components volume continued a trend of stable to improving market conditions 
ebit increased and ebit margins improved versus primarily due to benefits from the fixture display tactical plan  including cost savings and improved operational efficiency non recurrence of s inventory write downs higher sales in our office furniture components businesses gains related to the sale of buildings no longer used in operations million these items were partially offset by higher raw material costs  currency rate impacts approximately million  and modest restructuring charges million 
aluminum products sales ebit ebit margins dollar amounts in millions year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease internal sales growth acquisition sales growth higher unit volumes contributed about three quarters of the internal sales improvement 
this growth reflected new programs for producers of motorcycles  small engines  large appliances  and others 
ebit and ebit margins also increased versus earnings gains from higher sales were partially offset by inflation in aluminum costs 

table of contents industrial materials sales ebit ebit margins dollar amounts in millions year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease internal sales growth acquisition sales growth the sales increase was almost entirely due to inflation  which resulted from the pass through of higher steel costs 
unit volumes were up modestly in the first three quarters but declined in the fourth quarter due to weaker bedding demand 
for the full year  unit volume was essentially flat 
ebit and ebit margins increased significantly versus levels 
earnings benefited from higher sales  full utilization of our steel rod mill  and an above average market spread between scrap costs and selling prices for rod this spread benefited our rod mill 
specialized products sales ebit ebit margins dollar amounts in millions year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease internal sales growth acquisition sales growth higher unit volumes and changes in currency rates each contributed about half of s internal sales growth 
our machinery operations posted double digit gains for the full year  as bedding manufacturers increased spending on new equipment 
in addition  we saw modest growth in our automotive businesses  reflecting benefits of new programs and increased product placement 
ebit and ebit margins decreased versus the earnings decline resulted from currency impacts approximately million in certain automotive operations  we incur costs in canadian dollars and sell products in us dollars 
the weaker us dollar caused margin declines in these operations 
higher raw material costs due to the longer term supply contracts we have with many automotive customers  we experienced lags in recovering higher steel costs 
other factors  including higher depreciation million  costs associated with plant closings and consolidations million  and new product development costs 
these declines were partially offset by gains from higher sales 

table of contents liquidity and capitalization in this section  we provide details about our uses of cash cash from operations debt position and total capitalization our priorities for use of cash  in order of importance  are finance internal growth and acquisitions pay dividends and extend our record of annual increases repurchase our stock our operations provide much of the cash required to fund these priorities 
in  we also increased net debt and used excess cash to fund a portion of these items  including higher levels of acquisitions and share repurchases 
our long term goal is to have net debt as a percent of net capital in the range while maintaining our longstanding single a debt rating 
at the end of  we were approaching the lower end of that range 
uses of cash finance growth we use cash to fund growth  both internally through capital expenditures and externally through acquisitions 
logo capital expenditures are investments we make to modernize  maintain  and expand manufacturing capacity 
we expect capital spending to be at about the same level as 
table of contents logo acquisitions add to our business by expanding our markets  product lines  or manufacturing capabilities 
our level of spending increased in as we were able to complete several acquisitions including the third largest in our history 
in addition to the initial cash outlays for acquisitions shown in the accompanying chart  we also assumed debt of million  million  and million in our  and transactions 
our acquisitions companies in three of our business segments should contribute about million in annual revenues 
residential furnishings we added sales of about million from acquisitions 
the largest acquisition in the segment in was ikex jarex  the geo components business discussed on page the other acquisitions in the segment established  early in the year  a small foothold in geo components broadened our product offerings to include all major types of carpet underlay expanded our base of operations producing furniture mechanisms in china added to our businesses that produce and sell bedding components  upholstered furniture components  and top of the bed products commercial fixturing components we acquired one company which had been a key supplier to our fixture display operations for many years 
this company produces retail store fixtures and gondola shelving 
importantly  it gives us an operating presence in china from which to serve the growing domestic chinese market 
the acquisition expands our manufacturing capacity by million but does not increase our reported sales since nearly all the product is sold to other leggett operations for distribution in the us specialized products we added sales of about million through the acquisition of america s body company  a manufacturer of van interiors and truck bodies discussed on page we provide additional details about acquisitions in note b to the financial statements on page 
table of contents pay dividends logo logo logo actual dividend payout annual dividend rate average eps for prior three years in  we increased our annual dividend for the th consecutive year 
over the last three years  dividends have grown at an compound annual rate 
our long term target for dividend payout is approximately one third of the prior three years average earnings 
we ve been well above those levels in recent years  but as earnings grow  we expect to move back toward that target 
repurchase stock logo in  we purchased million of our shares  considerably more than in any previous year 
this was an opportunistic move that was driven by two main factors additional cash was available as we increased net debt  and a lower stock price in the last few months of the year presented an attractive buying opportunity 
almost six million shares were purchased during a nine week period in the third and fourth quarters  at an average price of about per share 
share repurchases should be lower in versus  in part because we do not expect as large an increase in our net debt levels 
as we first mentioned in september  we planned to increase our net debt levels toward the lower end of our targeted range and use the cash to fund growth  pay dividends  and repurchase shares 
going forward  the cash available to repurchase shares will fluctuate each year with earnings  capital spending  and the pace of acquisitions 
at a minimum we typically repurchase shares to replace those issued for employee stock plans approximately two million shares each year 
although no specific repurchase schedule has been established  we have been authorized by the board of directors to repurchase up to million shares in 
table of contents cash from operations logo cash from operations is our primary source of funds 
changes in earnings and working capital levels are the two broad factors that generally have the greatest impact on our cash from operations 
cash from operations in was higher than in despite lower earnings 
working capital decreased in due to two main factors accrued expenses and other current liabilities increased primarily from higher workers compensation accruals and restructuring liabilities 
this impact was partially offset by higher inventories 
inventories increased primarily due to inflation in certain raw material costs  increased purchases in anticipation of rising costs  and new programs in certain businesses 
working capital management remains a priority and we expect to further improve these levels in in  cash from operations benefited from stronger earnings  but was reduced overall by an increase in working capital 
the higher working capital levels were primarily the result of inflation 
in  cash from operations was relatively strong despite weak earnings  in part due to our ability to reduce working capital 
working capital levels vary by segment  with the requirements of aluminum products and commercial fixturing components generally higher than company averages 
accounts receivable balances in these segments are typically higher due to the longer credit terms required to service certain customers of the aluminum die casting and fixture display businesses 
these same businesses also require higher inventory investments due to the custom nature of their products  longer manufacturing lead times in certain cases  and the needs of many customers to receive large volumes of product within short periods of time 

table of contents capitalization this table presents key debt and capitalization statistics at the end of the three most recent years 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt outstanding scheduled maturities average interest rates average maturities in years revolving credit commercial paper total long term debt deferred income taxes and other liabilities shareholders equity total capitalization unused committed credit long term short term total unused committed credit current maturities of long term debt cash and cash equivalents ratio of earnings to fixed charges x x x our calculation of total capitalization  may be different from similarly titled measures of other companies 
fixed charges include interest expense  capitalized interest  and implied interest included in operating leases 
the next table shows the percent of long term debt to total capitalization at december  and we show this calculation in two ways long term debt to total capitalization as reported in the previous table 
long term debt to total capitalization each reduced by total cash and increased by current maturities of long term debt 
we believe that adjusting this measure for cash and current maturities allows more meaningful comparison to recent historical periods  during which cash has ranged from million to million 
we use these adjusted measures to monitor our financial leverage 
dollar amounts in millions long term debt current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net debt total capitalization current debt maturities cash and cash equivalents net capitalization long term debt to total capitalization net debt to net capitalization 
table of contents total debt which includes long term debt and current debt maturities decreased million in during the year we repaid million of debt that came due  and added million  including million of year notes at a coupon rate 
since  we ve issued million of fixed rate debt with an average remaining life at the end of of years  and a weighted average coupon rate of 
to further facilitate the issuance of debt and other securities  million remains available under a shelf registration 
in addition to issuing long term notes  we can also raise cash by issuing up to million in commercial paper through a program that is backed by a million  five year revolving credit commitment 
we expect any commercial paper issued under this agreement to be classified as long term debt since we intend to maintain or increase the balance until it is replaced with long term notes 
at year end  no commercial paper was outstanding 
with both the shelf registration and the commercial paper program in place  we believe we have sufficient funds available to support our ongoing operations and take advantage of growth opportunities 
most of our debt has fixed repayment dates 
at the end of  this debt consisted primarily of term notes 
our term notes and public debt currently carries a moody s rating of a and a standard poor s rating of a 
our commercial paper program carries a moody s rating of p and a standard poor s rating of a we have maintained a single a rating on our debt for over a decade 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future contractual obligations and commitments total payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years after years dollar amounts in millions long term debt capitalized leases operating leases purchase obligations interest payments deferred income taxes other obligations including pension total contractual cash obligations the long term debt payment schedule presented above could be accelerated if we were not able to make the principal and interest payments when due 
purchase obligations primarily include open short term days purchase orders that arise in the normal course of operating our facilities 
interest payments are calculated on debt outstanding at december  at rates in effect at the end of the year 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to do so requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments using historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different amounts could have been reported if we had used different 
table of contents assumptions 
actual amounts may differ from the estimates and judgments reflected in our financial statements and future changes to these estimates could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we consider accounting estimates to be critical if the estimates require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain  and if different estimates that management could have reasonably used in the current period or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
the judgments and estimates we make which we believe could have a significant effect on our financial statements are discussed below 
critical judgments and estimates impacting our ongoing results relate to asset and goodwill impairment inventory reserves workers compensation  general liability and employee benefit programs credit losses pension accounting income taxes contingencies  including litigation more information regarding our significant accounting policies can be found in note a to the financial statements on page asset and goodwill impairment long lived assets primarily fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are tested annually and whenever there are indications that the book value of an asset may exceed the expected future cash flows from the use of the asset 
in performing these tests  we must make judgments and estimates about the future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets and their fair market values 
if actual future cash flows are less than our estimates  or our estimates change  we could incur future unanticipated impairment charges 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
we assess goodwill of each of our reporting units for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events and circumstances warrant 
our reporting units for goodwill purposes are one level below our operating segments and are the same as the groups disclosed in item business of this report 
we estimate the fair market values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model 
key assumptions and estimates used in the cash flow model include discount rate  internal sales growth  margins  capital expenditure requirements  and working capital requirements 
recent performance of the reporting unit is an important factor but not the only factor in our assessment 
fair market values calculated for each reporting unit may go up or down each year based on a re evaluation of the key assumptions 
to date  none of our assessments has determined a goodwill impairment for any of our reporting units 
the excess  as a percent  of fair value over net carrying value for each of our reporting units as of june  our annual testing date ranged from approximately to  with an overall average of 
the total carrying value of goodwill as of december   was billion 
one of our reporting units  the fixture display group  has experienced deterioration in profitability in recent years compared to historical levels 
if profitability does not continue to improve  there may be a future goodwill impairment in this reporting unit 
about million of goodwill is associated with these operations 

table of contents inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value by maintaining reserves for slow moving and obsolete items 
these reserves are based on turnover ratios calculated by item that reflect historical customer demand 
inventory with no activity ie that has not been used or sold in the previous months are generally reserved at  while active items with quantities exceeding months usage are reserved at net realizable value 
obsolete and slow moving inventory reserves totaled million as of december   or approximately of total inventory valued on a fifo basis 
workers compensation  general liability and employee benefit programs we are self insured for certain losses related to workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability  property  and medical insurance 
our self insurance deductibles range from million to million per occurrence 
workers compensation losses in excess of self insured levels are fully insured by third parties 
losses in excess of self insured levels for automobile  product  and general liability are insured up to an aggregate annual maximum of million  subject to certain limitations and exclusions 
when estimating our self insurance liabilities we consider a number of factors  including historical claim experience  demographic factors  and valuations provided by independent  third party actuaries 
our self insurance liabilities include estimates for both reported claims and for claims incurred but not yet reported 
these estimates are subject to change from period to period if claim patterns differ from historical trends 
changes can have a material affect on our results of operations 
the average variation in the estimated yearly ultimate losses for worker s compensation and general liability claims over the past five years has been approximately million or 
a change in our estimated self insurance liabilities at december   would have affected pre tax earnings for the year by approximately million 
credit losses our customers are diverse 
many are small to medium sized companies  and some are highly leveraged 
bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning  particularly in a changing economic environment 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
significant customer accounts are evaluated individually 
when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position we record a bad debt reserve to reflect the amount we reasonably believe is uncollectible 
for smaller customers  we record bad debt reserves based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  industry and macroeconomic considerations  and historical experience 
the total amount of credit losses over the last three years is million 
at december   our reserves totaled million against total consolidated accounts and other receivables of million 
in our year end evaluation  we identified million in receivables considered to be less than fully collectible 
of the total reserved amount  million relates to these accounts 
pension accounting accounting for our pension and postretirement benefit plans requires us to estimate the cost of benefits to be provided well into the future and the current value of our benefit obligations 
the two most critical assumptions affecting these estimates are the discount rate and the expected return on assets 
other assumptions include rates of future compensation increases  participant withdrawal and mortality rates  and participant retirement ages 
these estimates and assumptions impact the amount of net pension expense or income we recognize each year and the measurement of our reported benefit obligations under the plans 
we use a september measurement date for the majority of our plans 

table of contents to reflect market interest rates  in we reduced the discount rate for our major pension plans to from the which had been used in and we continued to assume long term returns of on the assets of these plans  the same as our assumptions for and and consistent with our experience over the past years 
plan assets are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity  debt  and government securities 
while we have historically targeted a weighted average portfolio of equities and bonds  the portfolio mix at year end as well as the target going forward was equities and bonds 
sensitivity to changes in the critical assumptions for our major plans is as follows discount rate a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase pension expense in by approximately 
million and decrease the plans funded status by approximately million 
expected return on assets a basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense in by 
million but have no effect on the plans funded status 
the total of the unrecognized net actuarial losses of our major plans was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  these losses are primarily the result of decreases in the discount rate since the implementation in of the pension accounting rules established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
in net pension expense will reflect the amortization of approximately million of these losses over an average of approximately years 
approximately million of the current year increase in the unrecognized net actuarial losses is due to a change in the life expectancies used in the calculation of the plans projected benefit obligations 
the remainder of the increase is primarily due to the current year change in the discount rate from to 
we do not expect any near term significant funding requirements for our major plans 
for  we are projecting a million contribution requirement  primarily for our foreign plans 
income taxes in the ordinary course of business  many transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
in addition  respective tax authorities periodically audit our income tax returns 
these audits examine our significant tax filing positions  including the timing and amounts of deductions and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that the actual outcomes will likely be different from our estimates 
as of december   six open years were either undergoing or subject to audit by the united states internal revenue service and canada revenue agency 
audits in both countries for and have been settled in all material respects with no significant adjustments 
at december  and we had million and million of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet related to operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the ultimate realization of these net deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount and source of future taxable income 
valuation reserves are established against future potential tax benefits in order to reflect the amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be realized 
in addition  certain assumptions have been made regarding the non repatriation of earnings from certain subsidiaries 
those assumptions may change in the future  thereby affecting future period results for the tax impact of such earnings 
finally  income taxes are recorded at the rates in effect in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
contingencies our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies is based on an assessment of whether the likelihood of loss is remote  reasonably possible  or probable and whether the amount of potential loss can be estimated 
loss contingency assessments involve judgments that are subjective and can involve matters in litigation  the results of which are generally very unpredictable 
although we believe our assessment of the likelihood of loss contingencies is accurate  the resolution of any contingency is inherently uncertain and our assessment may ultimately prove to be materially incorrect
