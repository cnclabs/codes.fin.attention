results of operations the past year was one of the more difficult years in the company s history 
although revenues within the fastener segment improved over  this increase reflects a partial recovery of higher raw material costs  rather than an increase in volume 
in addition  changes in our product mix had a negative impact on our bottom line 
demand within the assembly equipment segment  where we have traditionally enjoyed higher margins  continued to be weak  and this segment accounted for a smaller portion of revenues than in past years 
within the fastener segment  margins were adversely impacted by an increase in the percentage of product produced through the screw machine process which has traditionally generated lower margins than cold headed parts 
results were also adversely impacted by higher than normal administrative expenses related to legal matters and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of compared to revenues within the fastener segment increased by nearly million  or  compared with the prior year 
however  a change in product mix  combined with ongoing competitive pressures within our markets  which adversely impacted selling prices  contributed to the decline in gross margins within this segment 
change in product mix was the primary factor causing material costs to increase million compared to and was also the main factor contributing to a  increase in outside processing services 
labor and fringe benefit costs increased approximately  tooling costs increased by approximately  compared to  primarily due to costs related to the manufacture of new parts used in a number of new automotive platform launches 
the company also incurred an increase of  related to costs associated with expedited delivery due to shortened customer lead time requirements 
weak demand continued to characterize the assembly equipment segment of our business  contributing to a decline in revenues of  or  compared to the prior year 
we were able to reduce most manufacturing costs in direct proportion to the decline in revenues 
labor and fringe benefit costs declined by  raw material costs were  lower than the prior year 
most other elements of cost declined as a result of lower volumes 
however  the net effect of lower volume was a decline of  in gross margins 
selling and administrative expenses increased by  compared to the single largest factor affecting comparisons between this year and last is that during  the company received a refund of the michigan single business tax that amounted to  this refund was the result of a successful appeal of the tax calculation for the prior four years 
professional fees and expenses incurred  primarily related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  increased by  during legal fees increased approximately  primarily due to protracted litigation that was resolved in bad debt expense increased  primarily in connection with the bankruptcy of certain customers 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in a variety of other expenses  the most significant being a reduction in profit sharing expense of  due to the decrease in profitability and lower depreciation of office equipment of  during the fourth quarter of  the company realized a gain of  from proceeds received due to the demutualization of an insurance provider 
compared to within the fastener segment  revenues increased by  or nearly million 
approximately million of this increase represents the recovery of higher material costs related to the increase in the price of steel wire and rod which are our primary raw materials 
the balance of the increase is primarily due to an increase in units shipped 
increases in the price of raw materials consumed in production amounted to  this was partially offset by an increase of  in scrap recovery and purchase discounts 
in addition  perishable tooling expense increased  due to expenses related to the initial production of a number of new parts  while wage and fringe benefit costs increased  these higher costs were partially offset by a  reduction in outside material processing costs  due to a change in product mix  and by savings of  realized by handling the majority of our routine maintenance internally  rather than outsourcing as had been the practice previously 
the net effect of these changes contributed to a  improvement in gross margin for this segment compared with revenues within the assembly equipment segment declined  or  compared to the prior year 
this change was due to lower unit volumes  which reflected lower demand for the product in this segment 
despite the reduction in volume  gross margins improved by  compared with factors contributing to this improvement included savings of  in wage and related benefit costs arising from reductions in the workforce undertaken in the fourth quarter of  a reduction of  in material costs  primarily due to reduced volumes  and a reduction in depreciation expense of  as more equipment became fully depreciated 
selling and administrative expenses declined  or  in compared with the largest single factor contributing to this change was a successful appeal of the michigan single business tax paid in four prior years 
the amount of this refund was  reductions in headcount contributed to a net reduction of  in salary and fringe benefit expense 
these savings were partially offset by an increase of  in profit sharing expense related to the increase in pre tax income

outlook for many of the challenges that contributed to poor results in remain in evidence as we begin increasing revenues remains critical to a return to profitability and continues to be a key objective 
our primary market is dominated by the activities of the big three domestic automobile manufacturers 
unfortunately  according to published data  their domestic production declined by nearly  the second  successive year to year decline 
it is too early in the year to project what their level of operations will be for in addition  their financial condition is such that they have announced objectives to reduce the cost of the material that they purchase 
this will likely result in continued pressure to reduce prices we charge for our product  while simultaneously reducing demand for domestic product as they rely more heavily on parts produced in lower cost economies 
this does not auger well for our ability to obtain much needed recovery of higher raw material costs 
we have made efforts to increase our sales revenues in all markets 
ongoing initiatives to have our product approved and used in foreign nameplates produced within the united states have met with some success and we plan to continue to pursue opportunities in this market 
our sales efforts will continue to emphasize value over price and will focus on more complex products used by customers for which our experience  expertise  quality and service are important factors in purchasing decisions 
we anticipate that selling and administrative expenses  which have been unusually high due to costs related to litigation and compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  will be lower in on the other hand  it is likely that our customers will continue to demand reductions in prices without sacrificing quality or service 
as our customers increasingly look to foreign sources to obtain product  we will be challenged to offer a level of quality and service that cannot be matched by offshore producers 
in order to meet these challenges  we will continue to seek out creative solutions that help improve our operations at all levels while continuing our efforts to control operating costs 
we wish to thank our customers  our employees and our shareholders for their loyalty during what has been a very difficult period for the company 
we believe that this continued support  combined with the company s sound financial condition  will help us as we face the challenges and pursue the opportunities that the new year will bring
