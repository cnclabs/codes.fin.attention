item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the ownership  management and development of hotels  resorts and timeshare properties and the franchising of lodging properties 
at december   our system contained  properties totaling approximately  rooms  primarily in the united states 
our brands include hilton  hilton garden inn  doubletree  embassy suites  hampton  homewood suites by hilton and conrad 
in addition  we develop and operate timeshare resorts through hilton grand vacations company and its related entities 
in february  we completed the acquisition of the lodging assets of hilton group plc for approximately billion  equivalent to approximately billion on the transaction date see note subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements under item 
we are also engaged in various other activities related or incidental to the operation of hotels 
the number of properties and rooms at december  by brand and by type are as follows brand properties rooms type properties rooms hilton owned hilton garden inn leased doubletree joint venture embassy suites homewood suites by hilton managed hampton franchised other timeshare timeshare total total includes majority owned and controlled hotels 
our operations consist of three reportable segments which are based on similar products or services hotel ownership  managing and franchising  and timeshare 
the hotel ownership segment derives earnings from owned  majority owned and leased hotel properties and equity earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily hotel and other real estate joint ventures 
the managing and franchising segment provides services including hotel management and licensing of our family of brands to franchisees 
this segment generates its revenue from fees charged to hotel owners 
as a manager of hotels  we are typically responsible for supervising or operating the hotel in exchange for fees based on a percentage of the hotel s gross revenue  operating profits  cash flow  or a combination thereof 
we charge franchise fees  depending on the brand  of up to five percent of rooms revenue in exchange for the use of one of our brand names 
the timeshare segment consists of multi unit timeshare resorts 
this segment sells and finances timeshare intervals and operates timeshare resorts 
the hospitality industry is seasonal in nature 
however  the periods during which our properties experience higher or lower levels of demand may vary from property to property and depend principally upon location 
our results are significantly affected by occupancy and room rates achieved by hotels  our ability to manage costs  the relative mix of owned  leased  managed and franchised hotels  the quantity and pricing of timeshare interval sales and the change in the number of available hotel rooms and timeshare intervals through acquisition  development and disposition 
results are also impacted by economic conditions and capacity 
unfavorable changes in these factors could negatively impact hotel room demand and pricing which  in turn  could limit our ability to pass through operating cost increases in the form of higher room rates 
additionally  our ability to manage costs could be adversely impacted by significant increases in operating expenses  resulting in lower operating margins 
see risk factors under item a for a description of these and other conditions that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we anticipate that a favorable economic environment will continue to benefit the lodging industry and our company in a continuation of strong hotel demand among business  group and leisure travelers  combined with limited full service hotel supply growth  should enable us to charge higher room rates 
we also anticipate growth in our management and franchise fee business as the number of hotels in our system continues to increase  as well as strong results from our timeshare business 
increases in energy and healthcare costs combined with higher property taxes are expected to continue to put pressure on margins 
increases in construction costs could result in downward pressure on the margins achieved by our timeshare business 
our results could also be impacted by potential labor disputes involving the hotel industry and certain of our properties 
we will continue to focus on managing our costs  achieving revenue per available room revpar premiums in the markets where we operate  increasing occupancy  adding new units to our family of brands  leveraging technology and delivering outstanding customer service 
we believe that our focus on these core strategies  combined with our financial strength  diverse market presence  strong brands  and strategically located properties will enable us to remain competitive 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions 
notes receivable are reflected net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts 
for timeshare notes receivable  this estimate is based primarily on historical experience and assumptions with respect to future payment trends 
allowances for uncollectible amounts of other notes receivable  which includes notes from managed  franchised and unconsolidated joint venture properties  are estimated based primarily on historical trends and analysis of underlying real estate collateral 
assessment of collateral may include estimates of future cash flow from the underlying real estate 
total notes receivable  including timeshare  totaled million and million  net of allowances for uncollectible amounts of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
we also maintain cost and equity method investments in entities that own and operate hotel properties and entities that perform other activities related or incidental to the operation of hotels 
the assessment of long lived assets for possible impairment requires us to make certain judgments  including estimates of real estate values and future cash flow from the respective properties and investments 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
results in  and include pre tax impairment charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to reduce the value of property and equipment and equity method investments to estimated fair value 
we account for the sale of real estate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards fas  accounting for sales of real estate 
to the extent we realize gains from the sale of real estate and maintain significant continuing involvement in the form of a long term management contract  the gain is deferred and recognized in earnings over the term of the contract 
the deferral of pre tax gains on such sales totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
results in  and include the recognition of pre tax deferred gains totaling million  million and million  respectively 
the deferral of gain recognition is dependent on the structure of individual sale transactions 
our intangible assets include management and franchise contracts  leases  brands and goodwill 
we account for management and franchise contracts in accordance with fas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires that we review our management and franchise contracts for impairment when circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the values of our management and franchise contracts and leases are amortized using the straight line method over the life of the agreements 
the assessment of management and franchise contracts and leases requires us to make certain judgments  including estimates of future cash flow from the respective properties 
management and franchise contracts  net  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we account for brands and goodwill in accordance with fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but are reviewed annually for impairment 
the annual impairment review requires estimates of future cash flow with respect to the brands and estimates of the fair value of our company and its components with respect to goodwill 
we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation and employee medical and dental insurance coverage at our owned locations 
we purchase insurance coverage for claim amounts which exceed our self insured retentions 
depending on the type of insurance  these self insured retentions range from  to  per claim 
the undiscounted amount of our self insurance reserves totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
our insurance reserves are accrued based on estimates of the present value of claims expected to occur during the covered period 
these estimates are prepared with the assistance of outside actuaries and consultants 
our actuaries periodically review the volume and amount of claims activity  and based upon their findings  we adjust our insurance reserves accordingly 
the ultimate cost of claims for a covered period may differ from our original estimates 
general liability and workers compensation claim estimates are discounted to determine the present value of projected settlements  the discount rates used in the through program years were approximately to  which we considered reasonable based on claims settlement patterns 
since medical and dental claims are generally paid within several months  we do not discount the related insurance reserves 
we have issued letters of credit and guaranteed certain debt and obligations of unconsolidated affiliates and third parties totaling million at december  under certain circumstances  we may be obligated to provide additional letters of credit or guarantees totaling million 
assessment of the probability that we will be required to fund under these commitments requires us to make estimates of the ability of others to meet their obligations 
the estimates and assumptions related to notes receivable  long lived assets  intangible assets  commitments and self insurance reserves are subject to change based on the factors identified above 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and have resulted in accurate measurement of the related accounts in our historical financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
because estimates are used  it is reasonably likely that there will be some variability between projected results and actual results over time 
in addition  given the significance of these accounts to our consolidated financial position  the variability between projected and actual results could be material to our financial position or results of operations 
development and capital spending overview in february  we completed the acquisition of the lodging assets of hilton group plc for approximately billion  equivalent to approximately billion on the transaction date 
the all cash transaction was financed with existing cash on hand at the time of the closing and with borrowings under our new senior credit facilities see liquidity and capital resources financing and note subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements under item 
we also intend to grow our hotel system through franchising and the addition of management contracts  which require little or no capital investment 
we will also continue to invest in capital improvements and select projects at our owned hotels and the development of timeshare properties 
in addition  we may seek to acquire ownership interests in hotel properties on a strategic and selective basis  either directly or through investments in joint ventures 
during  we added a total of properties  primarily franchises  with approximately  rooms to our system 
a total of properties  primarily franchises  with approximately  rooms were removed from our system in we expect to add approximately hotels and  rooms to our hotel system in  with hampton and hilton garden inn accounting for most of the new development 
we expect virtually all of this growth to be through franchise and management agreements 
this growth excludes potential new international development opportunities as a result of the hi acquisition 
we believe our brand growth strategy continues to benefit from the significant market share premiums most of our brands command over their respective competitive sets 
with representing a brand s fair share of the market  our brands according to smith travel research posted revenue per available room revpar index numbers as follows for embassy suites   hampton   hilton garden inn   homewood suites by hilton   hilton   and doubletree  in july  it was announced that hampton  hilton garden inn for the fourth straight year and homewood suites by hilton for the third straight year each earned first place rankings for customer satisfaction in their respective categories from jd power and associates 
hilton was the only hotel company with three brands earning top rankings 
in addition  the hilton  doubletree and embassy suites brands all improved their respective customer satisfaction scores in the jd power study 
we believe the continued strong performance of our brands has enabled us to significantly enhance our development pipeline versus our industry competitors 
we had approximately hotels  primarily franchises  with  rooms in our development pipeline at december   excluding potential development associated with the hi acquisition 
the consummation of transactions in our development pipeline is subject to various conditions and uncertainties 
our ability to grow the number of hotels in our system is affected by the factors referenced under item a risk factors  such as international  national and regional economic conditions  the effects of actual and threatened terrorist attacks and international conflicts  acts of god  such as natural disasters  credit availability  relationships with franchisees and property owners  and competition from other hotel brands 
we will continue to review our owned hotel portfolio for potential repositioning or re branding opportunities see liquidity and capital resources acquisitions and dispositions and we may seek to sell certain assets  including assets acquired in the hi acquisition see note subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements under item 
it is our intention to be opportunistic when evaluating potential asset sales and we will look to sell particular hotel properties to the extent we can obtain premium prices 
we are currently marketing for sale certain of our owned hotels 
as discussed in note acquisitions and dispositions to the consolidated financial statements under item  until the necessary approvals have been received and substantive conditions to the buyer s obligation to perform have been satisfied  we do not consider a sale to be probable 
when we sell a hotel property  it is generally our preference to retain a management or franchise agreement  however  we may sell hotels without retaining our brand 
hotel ownership capital expenditures during  excluding timeshare projects  totaled million 
excluding the million to purchase land on hawaii s big island  as discussed in note acquisitions and dispositions to the consolidated financial statements under item  our capital expenditures were million  consisting primarily of routine improvements at our owned and leased hotels 
we continue to place a priority on making appropriate capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our owned assets 
during  we spent approximately million to upgrade the bedding and televisions at our owned and leased hotels 
managing and franchising total property additions to our system in included franchise properties and nine managed properties owned by third parties 
these additions included properties which  due in part to the market share leadership of our brands  were converted to our family of brands in the conversions included doubletrees  seven hiltons  four hilton garden inns  two hamptons  two homewood suites  one embassy suites and one conrad 
in the first quarter of  we announced an initiative with hi  formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of hilton group plc  and now a wholly owned subsidiary of ours see note subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements under item  to develop the luxury conrad brand on a global basis 
the growth in the conrad brand will continue to be primarily through management agreements  including a new luxury property in chicago opened fourth quarter  a new hotel in downtown indianapolis scheduled opening and a new conrad hotel on the las vegas strip scheduled opening 
in the third quarter of  conrad announced the signing of a management contract for a room luxury property in jakarta  indonesia  scheduled to open in we also hold a percent investment in the partnership that is developing the conrad jakarta 
in early  we introduced a new brand  the waldorf astoria collection 
this new  elite brand designation debuts with new york s legendary waldorf astoria  along with three world class luxury resorts newly managed by hilton the grand wailea resort hotel spa on the island of maui in hawaii  the arizona biltmore resort spa in phoenix  and la quinta resort club in la quinta  california 
we anticipate that the waldorf astoria collection will grow primarily through branding of existing landmark or boutique hotels  co branding of existing hilton and conrad hotels and opening newly built properties in select cities 
timeshare we are currently developing new timeshare projects in las vegas  nevada  orlando  florida and waikoloa  hawaii 
the waikoloa project is expected to have units  of which units opened in  with the remaining units scheduled for completion in spring at our international drive property in orlando tuscany village  the project has units open  representing four phases 
construction is continuing on the next units  which are scheduled to open in spring also in orlando  we are adding units to our existing property adjacent to sea world 
the second phase of our property on the las vegas strip  which consists of units  is on schedule for completion in summer upon the opening of phase two  approximately of the planned four tower   unit project will have been completed 
capital expenditures associated with our timeshare operations during totaled million 
the capital expenditures associated with our non lease timeshare products are reflected as inventory until the timeshare intervals are sold 
we also provide financing to the buyers of our timeshare intervals 
during  we issued approximately million of loans related to timeshare financings 
principal collections on timeshare notes during the same period were approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources overview net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net decrease in relates primarily to net cash used by timeshare construction in excess of timeshare sales and a reduction in deferred income taxes resulting from the sale of assets in these decreases were partially offset by improved operating results 
the net increase in compared to was due primarily to improved operating results and net cash provided by timeshare sales in excess of new timeshare construction during the year 
the increase in cash from operating activities also reflected timing differences resulting in an increased minimum pension liability and the deferral of revenue on timeshare sales 
these increases were partially offset by increases in restricted cash and an increase in the net balance of timeshare notes receivable 
net cash provided by operating activities in  and each benefited from a reduction in the valuation allowance for capital loss tax carryforwards and other items which reduced the provision for income taxes see liquidity and capital resources acquisitions and dispositions and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements under item 
our ability to utilize capital loss tax carryforwards to reduce our provision for income taxes is dependent on the availability of capital loss tax carryforwards and the existence of transactions that enable these capital loss carryforwards to be utilized 
therefore  it should not be assumed that such benefits will be available to us in the future 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in and net cash provided by investing activities totaled million in the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from asset dispositions in compared to the prior year  partially offset by higher capital expenditures 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled million in compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in the increase in net cash used in investing activities in was primarily due to reduced proceeds from asset dispositions in compared to  as well as an increase in additional investments in over the prior year 
this increase in net cash used was partially offset by higher payments received on non timeshare notes receivable in net cash used in financing activities totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in reflects increased share repurchases and lower proceeds from the issuance of common stock  reflecting a lower volume of stock option exercises  partially offset by a lower level of debt repayments in the period 
all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility were repaid in the second quarter of net cash used in financing activities in and primarily represents the repayment of long term debt in excess of additional long term borrowings 
the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in compared to reflects a lower level of debt repayment in the period once the revolving credit facility was repaid  and higher proceeds from the issuance of common stock in  reflecting a higher volume of stock option exercises 
this combined decrease in the net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by share repurchases in our ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended december   and was x  x and x  respectively 
cash and equivalents totaled billion at december   an increase of million from december  the increase in cash and equivalents is due primarily to the assets dispositions and increased operating results during over the previous year 
in february  we used approximately million of cash to partially fund the purchase of the lodging assets of hilton group plc see note subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements under item and liquidity and capital resources financing 
restricted cash totaled million at december   an increase of million from the prior year 
restricted cash includes cash related to certain consolidated hotels  the use of which is restricted for hotel purposes under the terms of collateralized borrowings  refundable deposits on the sale of timeshare intervals  and cash balances held by a consolidated non controlled entity 
we believe that our operating cash flow  available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and our ability to obtain additional financing through various financial markets are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs see liquidity and capital resources financing 
however  any projections of future financial needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty 
see results of operations below  additional information forward looking statements under item and risk factors under item a for further discussion of conditions that could adversely affect our estimates of future financial needs and sources of working capital 
financing at december   we had a billion revolving credit facility  with an option to increase the size of the facility by an additional million 
this facility was amended in the first quarter of the amendment lowered our all in cost of borrowing under this facility by basis points from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points and extended the facility until march there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  the capacity under our revolver was also used to support certain outstanding letters of credit 
total revolving debt capacity of approximately million was available to us at december  in connection with the hi acquisition in february see note subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements under item  we entered into new senior credit facilities in an aggregate principal us dollar equivalent amount of approximately billion with a syndicate of financial institutions 
these facilities replaced our billion revolving credit facility and are secured by a pledge of the capital stock of certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the credit facilities consist of the following three tranches us dollar denominated revolver year  billion available in us dollars  british pounds sterling  euros and swedish kronor or other currencies acceptable to the administrative agent 
interest at a variable rate depending upon our leverage ratio and senior debt ratings  with initial borrowings at libor plus basis points which includes a basis point annual facility fee 
foreign currency denominated term loan a year  approximate equivalent of billion to be denominated in million  million and australian million 
interest at a variable rate depending upon our leverage ratio and senior debt ratings  with initial borrowings at libor plus basis points 
us dollar denominated term loan b year  million term loan available only in us dollars 
interest at a rate of libor plus basis points 
we also have the option to increase the credit facilities by million 
in february  we borrowed an aggregate principal us dollar equivalent amount of approximately billion under these facilities to partially fund the hi acquisition 
subsequent to our announcement in december of our agreement to acquire the lodging assets of hilton group plc  standard poor s ratings group lowered our senior debt rating from bbb to bb 
in addition  moody s investor services lowered our senior debt rating from baa to ba these downgrades are reflected in the interest rates and facility fee of our new billion credit facilities 
under the terms of the credit facilities  the proceeds from the sale of certain owned properties acquired as part of the hi acquisition are required to be used for the repayment of our senior credit facilities 
in addition  we expect that excess cash flow will be used to repay outstanding debt balances to improve our credit position 
provisions under various loan agreements require us to comply with certain covenants which include limiting the amount of our outstanding indebtedness 
our revolving credit facility at december   contained two significant financial covenants a leverage ratio and a debt service coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with our financial covenants as of december  in october  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission registering up to billion in debt or equity securities 
at december   available financing under the shelf totaled million 
the terms of any additional securities offered under the shelf will be determined by market conditions at the time of issuance 
provisions of the financing agreement related to our collateralized borrowings due require that certain cash reserves be maintained and also restrict the transfer of excess cash generated by the related properties from the subsidiary hotels to the parent company if net cash flow falls below a specified level the cash trap 
the cash trap became effective in due to reduced cash flow from the collateralized properties  primarily the hilton san francisco 
as of december   cash restricted under the terms of the collateralized borrowings  including required reserves and the cash trap  totaled million 
the impact of the cash trap  which is expected to remain in effect throughout  is not expected to have a material impact on our liquidity 
as of december   approximately of our long term debt  including the impact of interest rate swaps  was floating rate debt 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december   including long term debt and operating lease commitments payments due by period contractual obligations in millions total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases total contractual obligations total debt decreased by million from december  to billion at december  this decrease was primarily due to the repayment of two mortgages on one hotel sold during the second quarter 
operating lease commitments decreased by million from december  to million at december  primarily due to the purchase of land on which the hilton waikoloa village is located see note acquisitions and dispositions to the consolidated financial statements under item 
we had previously leased this land pursuant to an agreement expiring in in addition  during the fourth quarter  we sold the hilton san diego which was subject to a long term ground lease

results of operations the following discussion presents an analysis of our results of operations for the three years ended december  our operations consist of three reportable segments which are based on similar products or services hotel ownership  managing and franchising  and timeshare 
fiscal compared with fiscal overview a summary of our consolidated results for the years ended december  and is as follows change in millions  except per share amounts revenue operating income net income basic eps diluted eps results in benefited from strong increases in room nights and average daily rate adr across all business segments  with particularly strong increases in adr  resulting in double digit revpar growth and margin improvement at many of our comparable owned hotels 
management and franchise fee revenue was our highest to date  increasing percent over the prior year as a result of revpar growth and the addition of new units 
results in also benefited from strong results at our timeshare business 
net income in also benefited from gains associated with the sale of owned hotels and a reduction in the provision for income taxes 
revenue growth was adversely impacted by the aforementioned asset sales and the impact of hurricane katrina on our two owned hotels in new orleans 
revenue from owned hotels totaled billion in  a one percent decrease from billion in  and total expenses in were down three percent to billion 
strong results at our comparable owned hotels were partially offset by the impact of asset sales and hurricane katrina 
our two owned hotels in new orleans are excluded from the comparable numbers due to interruptions in operations caused by the hurricane 
see note hurricane katrina to the consolidated financial statements under item excluding the impact of assets sales and our two owned hotels in new orleans  owned hotel revenue in was up percent to billion from billion in  while owned hotel expenses increased seven percent to billion from billion in results at our comparable owned properties benefited from continued strong demand and average rate increases from groups  business and leisure travelers  including double digit rate and revpar increases from the leisure and business segments 
results in new york and hawaii were particularly strong in strong results were also reported at our owned hotels in boston  washington dc and atlanta  while san francisco remained comparably weak 
revpar for comparable owned properties increased percent for the year  with occupancy rising points to percent and average daily rate up percent to 
approximately percent of the revpar increase at the comparable owned hotels was attributable to rate gains 
while strong revpar increases led to solid growth in rooms revenue  other comparable owned hotel revenue also performed well  with food and beverage revenue increasing seven percent over group room nights  which typically generate higher margin food and beverage business  were up two percent at our comparable owned hotels 
margins at our comparable owned hotels revenue less expenses as a percentage of revenue for comparable owned hotels improved basis points in to percent 
cost per occupied room increased percent in  reflecting a percent increase in energy costs 
leased hotel revenue totaled million in  consistent with  while leased hotel expenses decreased two percent to million 
due to the relatively large size of the lease payments required in a hotel operating lease  the leased properties operate at margins significantly lower than our owned hotels 
leased hotel revenue and expenses are included with our owned hotels in our hotel ownership segment results 
operating income from unconsolidated affiliates decreased million in to million 
the decrease relates primarily to a million pre tax gain in the period  resulting from a joint venture that developed a condominium project in myrtle beach  south carolina 
this decrease was partially offset by improved results at joint venture properties and the termination or sale of certain joint venture interests that generated losses in operating income from unconsolidated affiliates is included in our hotel ownership segment results 
management and franchise fee revenue increased million or percent to a record million in fee revenue is based primarily on rooms revenue at franchise properties and total operating revenue and to a lesser extent gross operating profits or cash flow at managed properties 
the strong demand among business  groups and leisure travelers that benefited our owned hotels also resulted in strong revpar gains for each of our brands on a system wide basis including managed and franchised properties 
the increase in management and franchise fees in also reflects the addition of new units to our system of hotels 
revenue from our timeshare operations included in timeshare and other income totaled million  an increase of million or percent from million in timeshare expenses in included in other operating expenses were million compared to million in the prior year 
timeshare revenue and earnings are generated through developing timeshare resorts and selling the related intervals  financing the sale of timeshare intervals and through management of timeshare resorts 
overall timeshare unit sales were up eight percent in  reflecting continued strong sales at our projects in hawaii  las vegas and orlando 
the average unit sales price increased two percent across the system 
timeshare revenue and profitability also benefited from higher resort fees and higher financing income due to increased sales 
timeshare results in also reflect the recognition of previously deferred revenue and expenses at our waikoloa project  due to the required percentage of completion accounting 
construction at the waikoloa project was approximately percent complete at the end of in contrast  construction was not beyond a preliminary stage at the end of depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in to million  primarily due to asset sales and lower amortization expense related to certain long term management and franchise agreements that were either terminated or expired 
results in include impairment loss and related costs totaling million  which includes a pre tax charge of million related to an owned hotel and a million pre tax charge related to our minority interests in eight joint venture hotels to reduce their respective carrying values to their estimated fair values 
the charge also includes a million pre tax charge representing the write down of a non hotel cost basis investment to its estimated fair value 
the million impairment charge is included in our hotel ownership segment results  while the million charge on the non hotel investment is not allocated among our reportable segments 
results in include impairment loss and related costs totaling million 
this pre tax charge was to reduce the value of an owned hotel to its estimated fair value and is included in hotel ownership segment results 
corporate activity corporate expense totaled million in  an increase of million from the increase is primarily the result of increased expense associated with stock based compensation  increased hotel team member performance awards and contributions to hurricane katrina relief efforts 
corporate expense is not allocated among our reportable business segments 
interest and dividend income increased million compared to the prior year 
this increase reflects an increase in cash management activities  reflecting higher cash balances in due primarily to proceeds from asset sales 
this increase was partially offset by lower interest income due to the repayment by caesars entertainment  inc of the million senior notes in july interest on the notes is reflected as both interest income and interest expense in our consolidated statements of income through repayment in july interest expense  net of amounts capitalized  decreased million compared to  due primarily to the aforementioned repayment by caesars 
the million gain on asset dispositions and other in includes gains from asset sales of million see note acquisitions and dispositions to the consolidated financial statements under item  a million loss on our foreign currency options see note summary of significant accounting policies derivative instruments to the consolidated financial statements under item based on the market value of the options at december   and a million gain on our oil futures derivative see note summary of significant accounting policies derivative instruments to the consolidated financial statements under item based on the market value of the contract at december  also included in is a net loss of million related to the write off of several long term management and franchise agreements which were terminated during the year and a million loss on the disposition of other fixed assets 
the million pre tax loss on asset dispositions and other in represents the sale of two doubletree properties  the write off of the value assigned to several long term management and franchise agreements which were terminated during the year and a loss due to the fair market value adjustment of our derivative instruments  partially offset by the gain from the sale of certain investments 
the loss from non operating affiliates of million and million in and  respectively  represents equity losses associated with our percent minority interest in a coal based synthetic fuel facility 
the synthetic fuel produced at this facility qualifies for tax credits based on section of the internal revenue code  these credits reduce our provision for income taxes see note acquisitions and dispositions to the consolidated financial statements under item 
we acquired our minority interest in august  which results in the comparably low amount in the prior year 
the effective income tax rate for decreased to from in the effective rate in includes a benefit of million resulting from closures of irs audits  a reduction in the valuation allowance for capital loss tax carryforwards totaling million associated with asset sales and the utilization of section synthetic fuel production credits of approximately million 
the effective tax rate also includes net state tax credits of approximately million 
the effective tax rate in benefited from a reduction in the valuation allowance for capital loss tax carryforwards of approximately million resulting from the sale of three doubletree properties la posada in arizona  as well as bakersfield and modesto in california and the sale of our interest in travelweb 
in addition  the effective tax rate also reflects the utilization of section synthetic fuel production credits of approximately million

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the form of changes in interest rates and the potential impact such changes may have on the cash flow from our floating rate debt and the fair values of our fixed rate debt 
we attempt to limit the impact of changes in interest rates to our debt portfolio by attaining an appropriate mix of floating rate borrowings relative to our long term fixed rate debt 
we are also exposed to interest rate risk on our floating rate notes receivable and the fair values of our fixed rate notes receivable 
we utilize  on a selective basis  interest rate swaps to manage our relative levels of fixed and floating rate debt 
as of december   we had a derivative contract which swaps the fixed interest payments on our million senior notes due to a floating interest rate equal to the six month libor rate plus basis points 
we are also exposed to market risk in the form of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the potential impact such changes may have on the cash flow related to our foreign currency denominated debt 
in august  we issued million of bonds due denominated in chilean pesos 
payments of principal and interest on the bonds are adjusted for movements of the unidad de fomento the chilean inflation index published monthly by the central bank of chile 
we have swapped out the chilean currency exchange rate and inflation risk by entering into a derivative contract which swaps the principal payment to a fixed us dollar amount of million with fixed interest payments at of that amount

if the average price of oil in was less than  the derivative would yield no payment 
if the average price of oil exceeded  the derivative would yield a payment equal to the excess of the average price over per barrel  multiplied by the number of barrels covered  up to a maximum price per barrel of the purpose of the transaction was to provide economic protection against an increase in oil prices that could limit the amount of tax credits available under section of the internal revenue code 
the strike prices of the two call options are intended to approximate the price ranges under which the tax credit could be reduced or eliminated by an increase in oil prices
