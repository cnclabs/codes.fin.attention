item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion includes forward looking statements  including but not limited to statements with respect to the future financial performance  operating results  plans and objectives of mission west properties  inc 
actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated depending upon a variety of factors  including those described in part i item a  risk factors 
overview and background our original predecessor was formed in as palomar mortgage investors  a california business trust  which operated as a mortgage reit until when  under the name of mission investment trust  it terminated its status as a reit and began to develop and market its own properties 
in  mission west properties was incorporated as a successor to mission investment trust 
in  our predecessor  mission west properties  sold all its real estate assets and paid a special dividend of per share to stockholders  after which it retained only nominal assets 
subsequently  the berg group acquired control of the corporation as a vehicle to acquire r d properties  or interests in entities owning such properties in a transaction completed on september  at that time the berg group and other investors acquired an aggregate controlling ownership position 
in may  we  the berg group members  an independent limited partner  and certain other persons entered into an acquisition agreement providing  among other things  for our acquisition of interests as the sole general partner in the operating partnerships 
at the time  the operating partnerships held approximately million rentable square feet of r d property located in silicon valley 
the agreement also provided for the parties to enter into the pending projects acquisition agreement  the berg land holdings option agreement and the exchange rights agreement  following stockholder approval 
effective july   we consummated our acquisition of the general partnership interests in the operating partnerships through the purchase of the general partnership interests  and all limited partnership interests in the operating partnerships were converted into  op units  which represented ownership of approximately of the operating partnerships 
our general partnership interests represented the balance of the ownership of the operating partnerships 
at december   we owned a general partnership interest in the operating partnerships  taken as a whole  on a weighted average basis 
since the beginning of calendar year  we have been taxed as a qualified reit 
our reincorporation under the laws of the state of maryland through the merger of mission west properties into mission west properties  inc occurred on december   at which time all outstanding shares issued by our predecessor california corporation were converted into shares of our common stock on a one for one basis 
in july  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
the net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs  were used primarily to repay indebtedness 
we have grown through property acquisitions 
since september  we have acquired a total of approximately million rentable square feet of r d buildings under the pending project acquisition agreement  the berg land holdings option agreement  and from unrelated third parties 
the total cost of these properties was approximately million 
we issued a total of  op units and assumed debt totaling approximately million to acquire them 
major property acquisitions made by us from unrelated sellers include the following on april   we acquired the acre san tomas technology park consisting of seven r d properties with a total of approximately  rentable square feet for million 
we financed that acquisition through new debt and an existing line of credit 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and related footnotes 
accounting and disclosure decisions with respect to material transactions that are subject to significant management judgments or estimates include impairment of long lived assets  deferred rent receivables  and allocation of purchase price relating to property acquisitions and the related depreciable lives assigned 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions  giving due consideration to materiality  in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements  and potentially result in materially different results under different conditions and assumptions 
we believe that the following best describe our critical accounting policies real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost 
cost includes expenditures for improvements or replacements 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
gains and losses from sales are included in income in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas  accounting for sales of real estate 
the gain on the sale is only recognized proportionately as the seller receives payments from the purchaser 
interest income is recognized on an accrual basis  when appropriate 
business combinations statement of financial accounting standards  business combinations sfas  was effective july  the acquisition costs of each property acquired prior to july  were allocated only to building  land and leasing commission with building depreciation being computed based on an estimated weighted average composite useful life of years and leasing commission amortization being computed over the term of the lease 
acquisitions of properties made subsequent to the effective date of sfas are based on an allocation of the acquisition cost to land  building  tenant improvements  and intangibles for at market and above market in place leases  and the determination of their useful lives are guided by a combination sfas and management s estimates 
if we do not appropriately allocate these components or we incorrectly estimate the useful lives of these components  our computation of depreciation and amortization expense may not appropriately reflect the actual impact of these costs over future periods  which will affect net income 
impairment of long lived assets we review real estate assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted net cash flow  before interest  we will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between its carrying amount and its estimated fair value 
if impairment is recognized  the reduced carrying amount of the asset will be accounted for as its new cost 
for a depreciable asset  the new cost will be depreciated over the asset s remaining useful life 
generally  fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow  replacement cost or market comparison analyses 
the process of evaluating for impairment requires estimates as to future events and conditions  which are subject to varying market factors  such as the vacancy rates  future rental rates and operating costs for r d facilities in the silicon valley area and related submarkets 
the analysis that we prepare in connection with determining if there may be any asset impairment loss under sfas considers several assumptions holding period of ten years  months lease up period and cap rate ranging from to 
therefore  it is reasonably possible that a change in estimate resulting from judgments as to future events could occur which would affect the recorded amounts of the property 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recognized an impairment loss in on one asset held for sale under the application of this standard 
allowance for deferred rent and doubtful accounts the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
as such  we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable based on the evaluation of our tenants financial position  analyses of accounts receivable and current economic trends 
we also make estimates for a straight line adjustment reserve for existing tenants with the potential of early termination  bankruptcy or ceasing operations 
our estimates are based on our review of tenants payment histories  the remaining lease term  whether or not the tenant is currently occupying our building  publicly available financial information and such additional information about their financial condition as tenants provide to us 
the information available to us might lead us to overstate or understate these reserve amounts 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
moreover  actual future collections of accounts receivable or reductions in future reported rental income due to tenant bankruptcies or other business failures could differ materially from our estimates 
consolidated joint ventures we  through an operating partnership  own three properties that are in joint ventures of which we have controlling interests 
we manage and operate all three properties 
the recognition of these properties and their operating results are reflected on our consolidated financial statements  with appropriate allocation to minority interest  because we have operational and financial control of the investments 
we make judgments and assumptions about the estimated monthly payments made to our minority interest joint venture partners  which are reported with our periodic results of operations 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
investment in unconsolidated joint venture we  through an operating partnership  have a non controlling limited partnership interest in one unconsolidated joint venture 
this investment is not consolidated because the we do not exercise significant control over major operating and financial decisions 
we account for the joint venture using the equity method of accounting 
revenue recognition rental revenue is recognized on the straight line method of accounting required by gaap under which contractual rent payment increases are recognized evenly over the lease term  regardless of when the rent payments are received by us 
the difference between recognized rental income and rental cash receipts is recorded as deferred rent receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 
rental revenue is affected if existing tenants terminate or amend their leases 
we try to identify tenants who may be likely to declare bankruptcy  cease operations or are likely to seek a negotiated settlement of their obligation 
by anticipating these events in advance  we expect to take steps to minimize their impact on our reported results of operations through lease renegotiations  reserves against deferred rent receivable  and other appropriate measures 
our judgments and estimations about tenants capacity to continue to meet their lease obligations will affect the rental revenue recognized 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our rental revenue for any period if we made different judgments or estimations 
lease termination fees are recognized as other income when there is a signed termination letter agreement  all of the conditions of the agreement have been met  and when the tenant no longer has the right to occupy the property 
these fees are paid by tenants who want to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual term of the lease 
we cannot predict or forecast the timing or amounts of future lease termination fees 
we recognize income from rent  tenant reimbursements and lease termination fees and other income once all of the following criteria are met in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin the agreement has been fully executed and delivered  services have been rendered  the amount is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
with regards to critical accounting policies  where applicable  we have explained and discussed the criteria for identification and selection  methodology in application and impact on the financial statements with the audit committee of our board of directors  which has reviewed these policies

the lower rental rate from the new microsoft blend and extend lease  which accounted for more than half the decline  and the loss of several tenants due to cessation of operations  tenant relocation or tenant requiring lesser space since december  represented the balance of the decline 
our overall occupancy rate at december  and was approximately and  respectively 
according to nai bt commercial real estate  the occupancy rate for r d property in the silicon valley at december  was approximately 
due to an over supply of r d properties and competition from other landlords in the silicon valley bidding for tenants  our occupancy rate may drop further in if the  rentable square feet scheduled to expire is notrenewed or re leased 
factors that contributed to our low occupancy rate were primarily the general downturn in the silicon valley s economy in recent years  the softening of our market specifically and the expected weaker performance of our properties 
we are also currently negotiating with three tenants  jds uniphase  fujitsu and nortel networks  for early termination of leases on approximately  rentable square feet 
if these leases are terminated  our occupancy rate will decline further 
equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint venture as of december   we had investments in four r d buildings  totaling  rentable square feet in morgan hill  california  through an unconsolidated joint venture with tbi  in which we acquired a interest from the berg group in january we have a non controlling limited partnership interest in this joint venture  which we account for using the equity method of accounting 
for the years ended december  and  equity in earnings from the unconsolidated joint venture was approximately million and million including million relating to lease termination income  respectively 
our equity in earnings from this unconsolidated joint venture declined primarily due to the early termination of a tenant lease agreement in september as well as lower rents received from the properties of this joint venture

total operating expenses and real estate taxes exceeded tenant reimbursements because of vacancies  which reached approximately million rentable square feet by year end certain expenses such as property insurance  real estate taxes  and other fixed expenses are not recoverable from vacant properties

the income to common stockholders and minority interests attributable to discontinued operation from this property in was approximately million and million  respectively 
changes in financial condition year ended december  the most significant changes in our financial condition in resulted from the disposition of three r d properties  the acquisition of one r d property  debt refinancing and the exercise of stock options and exchange of op units for shares of the company s common stock 
during  we sold three vacant r d properties to unrelated third parties for a total gross sales price of approximately million 
those property dispositions deducted approximately  rentable square feet of space from our property portfolio 
the proceeds of approximately million from one of the three vacant r d property dispositions were classified as restricted cash for use in tax deferred property exchanges and were reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as restricted cash at december  in addition to those three property dispositions  we also acquired one vacant r d property from an unrelated third party for the purchase price of approximately million in a tax deferred exchange transaction 
this acquisition added approximately  rentable square feet to our property portfolio 
debt outstanding  including amounts due related parties  increased by million  or  from million as of december  to million as of december  due primarily to obtaining two new fixed rate collateralized mortgage loans from allianz life insurance company of north america  which were used primarily to pay down the citicorp loan  the berg group line of credit and the cupertino national bank line of credit 
during the year ended december   stock options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock were exercised at per share and stock options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock were exercised at per share 
total proceeds to the company were approximately million 
this increased paid in capital by approximately million 
in  three limited partners exchanged  op units for  shares of the company s common stock under the terms of the exchange rights agreement among the company and the limited partners of the operating partnerships resulting in a reclassification of approximately million from minority interest to paid in capital 
in  carl e 
berg gave  op units to charitable institutions that exchanged them for  shares of the company s common stock pursuant to the exchange rights agreement resulting in a reclassification of approximately million from minority interest to paid in capital

debt outstanding  including amounts due related parties  decreased by million  or  from million as of december  to million as of december  due to recurring debt service obligations 
interest rates continued to remain low in during the year ended december   stock options to purchase a total of  shares of the company s common stock were exercised at per share

the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the conversion of op units to shares of the company s common stock were applied to increase our percentage interest as general partner in the operating partnerships 
liquidity and capital resources in we anticipate a decline in operating cash flows from our operating property portfolio compared to because of reduced demand for r d properties in the silicon valley  lower rental rates for new and renewed leases signed in and an increase in vacant properties in in addition  if we are unable to lease a significant portion of the approximately  rentable square feet scheduled to expire in and current available space  our operating cash flows will be further affected adversely 
in addition  if we conclude agreements for early lease terminations with jds uniphase  fujitsu and nortel networks  there could be an additional  rentable square feet of vacant space 
with the expectation of lower revenues for the full year of  we expect our net operating income to continue to decline from we are also subject to risks of decreased occupancy through tenant defaults and bankruptcies  and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal of properties  which would result in reduction in cash flows from operations beyond the level we are anticipating currently 
it is reasonably likely that vacancy rates may continue to increase and effective rental rates on new and renewed leases may continue to decrease in we expect our principal source of liquidity for distributions to stockholders and op unit holders  debt service  leasing commissions and recurring capital expenditures to come from cash provided by operations and or the borrowings under the line of credit with cupertino national bank 
we expect these sources of liquidity to be adequate to meet projected distributions to stockholders and other presently anticipated liquidity requirements in we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of property development  property acquisitions and other material non recurring capital improvements through cash and investments  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities by us 
as of december  and  the company s total debt as a percentage of total market capitalization was and  respectively 
we have the ability to meet short term obligations or other liquidity needs based on a line of credit with cupertino national bank and our existing cash reserves 
in  we will be obligated to make payments totaling approximately million of debt principal under mortgage notes without regard to any debt refinancing or new debt obligations that we might incur  or optional payments of debt principal

as of december   we were in compliance with these loan covenants 
effective october   the company and the berg group mutually agreed to terminate the million line of credit with the berg group 
the berg group line of credit was originally scheduled to mature in march based on existing cash reserves and credit facilities  we determined that we no longer foresee a need for the berg group line of credit 
there are no borrowings currently outstanding under the berg group line of credit 
we did not incur any fees or charges for terminating the berg group line of credit 
cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately million from million as of december  to million as of december  primarily from excess proceeds of our debt refinancing loans with allianz life insurance company of north america see above 
restricted cash totaled million as of december  of this amount  million represents proceeds recieved from a property sale and interest income held in a separate cash account at a trust company for future use in tax defered exchanges

generally  our objective is to meet our short term liquidity requirement of funding the payment of our current level of quarterly common dividends to stockholders and op unit holders through our net cash flows provided by operating activities  less our recurring and nonrecurring property capital expenditures 
these operating capital expenditures are the capital expenditures necessary to maintain the earnings capacity of our operating assets over time 
for  we expect to maintain our current quarterly dividend payment rate to common stockholders and op unit holders of per share 
however  distributions are declared at the discretion of our board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution  our financial condition  capital requirements and such other factors  as our board of directors deems relevant 
see item a  risk factors stockholders are not assured of receiving cash distributions from us 
on january   we paid dividends of per share of common stock to all common stockholders of record as of december  on the same date  the operating partnerships paid a distribution of per op unit to all holders of op units

on december   the last trading day for the year  total market capitalization was approximately billion 
at december   the outstanding balance remaining under certain demand notes that we owed to the operating partnerships was million 
the due date of the demand notes has been extended to september  the principal of the demand notes  along with the interest expense  which is interest income to the operating partnerships  is eliminated in consolidation and is not included in the corresponding line items within the consolidated financial statements 
however  the interest income earned by the operating partnerships  which is interest expense to us  in connection with this debt  is included in the calculation of minority interest as reported on the consolidated statement of operations  thereby reducing our net income by this same amount 
at present  our only means for repayment of this debt is through distributions that we receive from the operating partnerships that are in excess of the amount of dividends to be paid to our stockholders 
historical cash flows comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december cash and cash equivalents were approximately million at december   an increase of million from million at december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to approximately million for the prior year 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from lower rental revenue with respect to the modification and extension of our lease with microsoft  payments of leasing commissions included in other assets that amounted to approximately million  increased in interest expense  lower market rental rates for renewed leases and the loss of several tenants due to their lease default  cessation of operations  or relocations resulting in increased vacancy rates from to that offset cash savings

cash used in investing activities during related to new equipment and improvements to real estate of million 
the proceeds of approximately million from one of the three vacant r d property dispositions were classified as restricted cash for use in tax deferred property exchanges and were reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as restricted cash at december net cash provided by used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during and  we paid debt principal and made distributions to holders of our common stock and op units utilizing cash generated from operating activities and other borrowed funds 
during  financing activities included borrowing million under two new collateralized mortgage loans  which were used to repay short term debt and the berg group line of credit 
for the year ended december   we paid dividends to our stockholders totaling approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  distributions made to op unit holders in excess of their share of earnings were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the overall increase in cash was primarily due to the excess proceeds from debt refinancing with allianz life insurance company of north america 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december cash and cash equivalents were approximately million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to approximately million for the prior year 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from the collection of accounts receivable from a tenant bankruptcy settlement that was accrued in  decreases in prepaid expenses and the decrease of deferred rent receivable where cash rent income exceeded gaap income 
these increased cash receipts were partially offset by lower market rental rates  reductions in tenant expense reimbursements and the loss of several tenants due to their lease default  cessation of operations  or relocations resulting in increased vacancy rates that offset cash savings 
net cash used in investing activities for improvements to real estate was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the prior year 
cash used in investing activities during related to financing the acquisition of the san tomas technology park of million as well as new equipment and improvements to real estate of million 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during and  we paid debt principal and made distributions to holders of our common stock and op units utilizing cash generated from operating activities and other borrowed funds 
in we drew down million from our line of credit with the berg group 
in  financing activities included borrowing million under two new collateralized mortgage loans  of which million was used to repay short term debt and the berg group line of credit and million was used for the acquisition of the san tomas technology park 
for the year ended december   we paid dividends to our stockholders totaling approximately million compared to approximately million for the year ended december  distributions made to op unit holders in excess of their share of earnings were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures the properties require periodic investments of capital for tenant related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements 
for the years ended december  through december   the recurring tenant building improvement costs and leasing commissions incurred with respect to new leases and lease renewals of the properties averaged approximately million annually 
we will have approximately  rentable square feet under expiring leases in we expect that the average annual cost of recurring tenant building improvements and leasing commissions  related to these properties  will be approximately million during we believe we will recover substantially all of these costs from the tenants under the new or renewed leases through contractual increases in rental rates 
until we actually sign the leases  however  we cannot assure you that this will occur 
capital expenditures may fluctuate in any given period subject to the nature  extent  and timing of improvements required to be made to the properties 
tenant building improvements and leasing costs also may fluctuate in any given period year depending upon factors such as the property  the term of the lease  the type of lease and the overall market conditions 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of property acquisitions and other material non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities by the company  but cannot be assured that we will be able to meet our requirements on favorable terms 
see policy with respect to certain activities financing policies 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a non gaap financial measurement used by real estate investment trusts to measure and compare operating performance 
as defined by nareit  ffo represents net income loss before minority interest of op unit holders  computed in accordance with gaap  including non recurring events other than extraordinary items under gaap and excluding gains and losses from sales of discontinued operations or depreciable operating properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo does include impairment losses for properties held for sale and held for use 
management considers ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the company s operating and financial performance because when compared year over year  it reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  general and administrative expenses and interest costs  providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
in addition  management believes that ffo provides useful information about the company s financial performance when compared to other reits since ffo is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operations of reits 
we will still continue to use ffo as a measure of the company s performance 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative for net income as a measure of profitability nor is it comparable to cash flows provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  nor is ffo necessarily indicative of funds available to meet our cash needs  including our need to make cash distributions to satisfy reit requirements 
for example  ffo is not adjusted for payments of debt principal required under our debt service obligations 
our definition of ffo also assumes conversion at the beginning of the period of all convertible securities  including minority interests that might be exchanged for common stock 
our ffo does not represent the amount available for management s discretionary use  as such funds may be needed for capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
furthermore  ffo is not comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other reits that do not define ffo exactly as we do 
the ffo for the years ended december     and are as follows for the years ended december  dollars in thousands net income to common stockholders      add minority interests      depreciation and amortization of real estate      less gain on sales of joint venture assets or assets     ffo      the minority interest for third parties totaling    and in    and  respectively  was deducted from total minority interest in calculating ffo 
dollars in thousands also includes our portion of depreciation and amortization of real estate from our unconsolidated joint venture totaling  and in  and  respectively  and amortization of leasing commissions totaling     and in    and  respectively 
amortization of leasing commissions is included in the property operating  maintenance and real estate taxes line item in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
dollars in thousands overview of distribution policy we intend to make regular quarterly distributions to stockholders and op unit holders based on our funds available for distributions 
our ability to make such distributions will be affected by numerous factors including  most importantly  the receipt of distributions from the operating partnerships 
funds available for distributions does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the actual return that we will realize and the amount available for distributions to stockholders will be affected by a number of factors  including the revenues received from our properties  our operating expenses  debt service on borrowings  and planned and unanticipated capital expenditures 
we anticipate that cash available for distribution will exceed earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes  as the latter figure takes into account non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  that we will incur 
distributions  other than capital gain distributions  by us to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes most likely will be taxable to us stockholders as ordinary dividend income unless a stockholder is a tax exempt entity 
distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non taxable reduction of the us stockholder s basis in the common stock to the extent of such basis  and thereafter as taxable gain 
the percentage of such distributions in excess of earnings and profits  if any  may vary from period to period 
distributions are determined by our board of directors and depend on actual cash available for distributions  our financial condition  capital requirements  the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
for a discussion of the risk that we will not meet our distribution objectives  see part i  item a  risk factors stockholders are not assured of receiving cash distributions from us 
policies with respect to certain activities we have adopted policies with respect to investment  financing  conflicts of interest and other activities 
these policies have been formulated by our board of directors  are set forth in our charter  bylaws  operating partnership agreements or agreements with the berg group  and generally may be amended or revised from time to time  subject to applicable agreement terms  at the discretion of the board of directors without a vote of the stockholders 
among other things  these policies provide that so long as the berg group members and their affiliates  other than us and the operating partnerships  beneficially own  in the aggregate  at least of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis  the approval of a majority of our directors  including carl e 
berg or his designee as a director  and of the holders of a majority of the op units is required for us to take title to assets  other than temporarily in connection with an acquisition prior to contributing such assets to the operating partnerships  or to conduct business other than through the operating partnerships  or for us or the operating partnerships to engage in any business other than the ownership  construction  development and operation of real estate properties  or for certain fundamental corporate actions  including amendments to our charter  bylaws or any operating partnership agreement and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of the operating partnerships  changes in certain policies with respect to conflicts of interest must be consistent with legal requirements  certain policies with respect to competition by and acquisitions from the berg group are imposed pursuant to provisions of the acquisition agreement that cannot be amended or waived without the approval of the independent directors committee of our board of directors  we cannot take any action intended to terminate our qualification as a reit without the approval of more than of the entire board of directors  and we cannot undertake certain other specified transactions  including the issuance of debt securities  and borrowings in excess of specified limits  or the amendment of our charter and bylaws  without the approval of more than of the entire board of directors 
investment policies we expect to pursue our business and investment objectives principally through the direct ownership by the operating partnerships of our properties and future acquired properties 
development or investment activities are not limited to any specified percentage of our assets 
we may also participate with other entities in property ownership  through joint ventures or other types of co ownership 
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness that have priority over our equity interests 
while we will emphasize equity real estate investments  we may  in our discretion and subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification  invest in mortgage and other real estate interests  including securities of other real estate investment trusts 
we have not previously invested in mortgages or securities of other real estate investment trusts  and we do not have any present intention to make such investments 
financing policies to the extent that our board of directors determines to seek additional capital  we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings  debt financing or retention of cash flow  or through a combination of these sources  after consideration of provisions of the code requiring the distribution by a reit of a certain percentage of its taxable income and taking into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income 
it is our present intention that any additional borrowings will be made through the operating partnerships  although we may incur borrowings that would be re loaned to the operating partnerships 
borrowings may be unsecured or may be secured by any or all of our assets  the operating partnerships or any existing or new property  and may have full or limited recourse to all or any portion of our assets  the operating partnerships or any existing or new property 
we have adopted a policy of maintaining a consolidated ratio of debt to total market capitalization  which includes for this purpose the market value of all shares of common stock for which outstanding op units are exchangeable  of less than 
this ratio may not be exceeded without the approval of more than of our entire board of directors 
we also may determine to finance acquisitions through the exchange of properties or the issuance of additional op units in the operating partnerships  shares of common stock or other securities 
in the event that the board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital  it has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue additional shares of common stock  preferred stock or other capital stock  including securities senior to the common stock  in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
in the event that we issue any shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for  shares of common stock  subject to limited exceptions  such as the issuance of common stock pursuant to any stock incentive plan adopted by us or pursuant to limited partners exercise of the exchange rights or the put rights  the limited partners will have the right to purchase common stock or such securities in order to maintain their respective percentage interests in us on a fully diluted basis 
if the board of directors determines that we will raise additional equity capital to fund investments by the operating partnerships  we will contribute such funds to the operating partnerships as a contribution to capital and purchase of additional general partnership interest  however  holders of op units will have the right to participate in such funding on a pro rata basis 
in the event that holders of op units sell their op units to us upon exercise of their put rights  we are authorized to raise the funds for such purchase by issuing additional shares of common stock 
alternatively  we may issue additional shares of common stock in exchange for the tendered op units 
our board of directors also has the authority to cause the operating partnerships to issue additional op units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration  as it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
in the event that the operating partnerships issue new op units for cash  but not property  the limited partners holding op units in an operating partnership will have the right to purchase op units in order  and to the extent necessary  to maintain their respective percentage interests in that operating partnership 
the new op units will be exchangeable for common stock pursuant to the exchange rights or may be tendered to us pursuant to the put rights 
disposition policies from time to time we may dispose of properties in our portfolio  subject to the required approvals as set forth below 
the tax basis of the limited partners in the properties in the operating partnerships is substantially less than current fair market value 
accordingly  prior to the disposition of their op units  upon a disposition of any of the properties  a disproportionately large share of the gain for federal income tax purposes would be allocated to the limited partners 
consequently  it may be in the interests of the limited partners that we continue to hold the properties in order to defer such taxable gain 
in light of this tax effect  the operating partnership agreements provide that  until december   or until the berg group members and their affiliates  other than us and the operating partnerships  beneficially own  in the aggregate  less than of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis  if earlier  carl e 
berg and clyde j 
berg may prohibit the operating partnerships from disposing of properties which they designate in a taxable transaction 
mr 
kontrabecki has a similar right with respect to seven of the properties  which right will lapse before the end of the ten year period if his beneficial ownership interest falls below  op units 
the limited partners may seek to cause us to retain the properties even when such action may not be in the interests of some  or a majority  of our stockholders 
the operating partnerships will be able to effect tax deferred  like kind exchanges under section of the code  or in connection with other non taxable transactions  such as a contribution of property to a new partnership  without obtaining the prior written consent of these individuals 
the approval of a majority of our directors  including carl e 
berg or his designee  will be required to sell all or substantially all of our assets 
the consent of the holders of a majority of the op units will be required to effect a sale or sales of all  or substantially all  of the assets of any of the operating partnerships 
impact of recently issued accounting standards we do not believe that recently issued accounting standards will materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment sfas r  which addresses the accounting for employee and director stock options 
statement r requires that the cost of all employee and director stock options  as well as other equity based compensation arrangements  be reflected in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards 
sfas r is an amendment to sfas and supersedes apb opinion apb 
sfas r is applicable to any award that is settled or measured in stock  including stock options  restricted stock  stock appreciation rights  stock units  and employee stock purchase plans 
we will adopt the requirements of sfas r beginning we expect that the adoption of this standard will reduce our net income and earnings per share  however  it will have no impact on cash flow 
although we have not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  we are evaluating the requirements under sfas r including the valuation methods and support for the assumptions that underlie the valuation of the awards and the transition methods modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
compensation expense under sfas r may differ from pro forma amounts due to changes in fair value  different assumptions and treatment of forfeitures 
under sfas r  we estimate that compensation expense for will be approximately million against earnings 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  exchanges of non monetary assets sfas 
sfas amends the guidance in apb opinion  accounting for non monetary transactions  to eliminate certain exceptions to the principle that exchanges of non monetary assets be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
sfas eliminates the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
this statement is effective for non monetary asset exchanges in fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections sfas  to replace apb opinion  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements apb 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not generally hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we use fixed and variable rate debt to finance our operations 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our current variable rate debt and our future debt obligations 
we are vulnerable to significant fluctuations of interest rates on our floating rate debt 
we manage our market risk by monitoring interest rates where we try to recognize the unpredictability of the financial markets and seek to reduce potentially adverse effect on the results of our operations 
this takes frequent evaluation of available lending rates and examination of opportunities to reduce interest expense through new sources of debt financing 
several factors affecting the interest rate risk include governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economics and other factors that are beyond our control 
the following table provides information about the principal cash flows  weighted average interest rates  and expected maturity dates for debt outstanding as of december  the current terms of this debt are described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
average interest rates are based on implied libor for the respective time period 
for fixed rate debt  we estimate fair value by using discounted cash flow analyses based on borrowing rates for similar kinds of borrowing arrangements 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt at december  was approximately million 
for fixed rate debt  the table presents the assumption that the outstanding principal balance at december  will be paid according to scheduled principal payments and that we will not prepay any of the outstanding principal balance 
thereafter total fair value dollars in thousands fixed rate debt secured notes payable         weighted average interest rate all of the debt is denominated in united states dollars 
the weighted average interest rate for fixed rate debt was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the difference in interest expense attributable to the average interest rate difference between and was million  which was a result of new debt obtained during the primary market risk we face is the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the cupertino national bank line of credit  which had a balance of zero at december   is tied to a libor based interest rate 
as a result  we pay lower rates of interest in periods of decreasing interest rates and higher rates of interest in periods of increasing interest rates 
at december   we had no interest rate caps or interest rate swap contracts 
in we entered into cash flow interest rate derivative as a means to hedge exposure to an increase in interest rates prior to securing a loan commitment in connection with a refinancing of certain variable rate debt to fixed rate long term mortgage debt 
we secured a year fixed rate mortgage loan commitment for million at annual interest rate and closed the derivative contracts 
since the interest rate derivative contracts did not qualify as a designated cash flow interest rate hedge in accordance with sfas  we recorded an approximately million charge to interest expense in as of december   we had no interest rate risk since there was no variable rate debt outstanding
