item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are committed to being the innovator and leader in providing products for the treatment of patients with functional somatic syndromes and other central nervous system disorders 
specifically  our strategy involves acquiring or in licensing central nervous system  or cns  active compounds and developing them for novel and typically underserved indications 
the term functional somatic syndromes refers to several related syndromes characterized more by symptoms  suffering and disability than by disease specific abnormalities that are found upon physical examination and include many overlapping pain and psychiatric conditions 
we pursue opportunities to acquire or in license cns active compounds in the areas in which the brain and body overlap  where cns mechanisms have a strong influence on somatic or bodily symptoms  and our two ongoing development programs are representative of this strategy 
our goal is to be the first to commercialize a product approved in the united states for the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome  or fms  the focus of our initial efforts in the area of functional somatic syndromes 
in january  we entered into a collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  inc  a leading marketer of cns drugs with a strong franchise in the primary care and psychiatric markets  for the development and marketing of milnacipran 
in july  we completed the first phase iii trial for milnacipran  which was commenced in october we announced the top line results from this first phase iii trial in september although the results did not achieve statistical significance at the p level  we believe the preliminary results support continuation of the development program and the planned development program for milnacipran is continuing 
this development program includes an ongoing second phase iii study and an additional third phase iii study that was initiated in the first quarter of we obtained an exclusive license for milnacipran from pierre fabre medicament in milnacipran has been marketed outside of the united states since as an antidepressant and has been used by over  patients worldwide 
we have paid pierre fabre a total of million  including upfront payments of million in connection with the execution of the original license agreement in and a million milestone payment in september  and issued pierre fabre  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock in connection with an amendment to the agreement with pierre fabre 
we are obligated to pay pierre fabre of any upfront and milestone payments received from forest laboratories as a sublicense fee 
a million such payment has been made to date 
after a total of million has been paid  any additional sublicense fees are credited against any subsequent milestone and royalty payments owed by us to pierre fabre 
if not used  these credits are carried forward to subsequent years 
additional payments to pierre fabre of up to a total of million will be due to pierre fabre based on meeting certain clinical and regulatory milestones 
under our agreement with forest laboratories  we sublicensed our rights to milnacipran to forest laboratories for the united states  with an option to extend the territory to include canada 
additionally  forest laboratories assumed responsibility for funding all continuing development of milnacipran  including the funding of clinical trials and regulatory approval  as well as a specified number of our employees 
however  in light of the increased expense and risk associated with running two parallel trials  we have agreed upon an alternative cost sharing arrangement with forest laboratories for the second phase iii trial only 
in connection with this arrangement  the amount of funding that we receive from forest laboratories for certain of our employees has been eliminated as of the fourth quarter in for the second phase iii trial only  and we will pay for a majority of the external costs of the second phase iii trial only  with forest reimbursing us under specific scenarios where the second phase iii trial is used as one of the two required pivotal trials in the nda submission to the fda 
forest laboratories is funding the third phase iii clinical trial  including a specified number of our employees that are assisting with the conduct of that clinical trial 
forest laboratories will also be responsible for sales and marketing activities related to any product developed under the agreement  while we have the option to co promote using our own sales force up to of the total physician details and would be reimbursed by forest in an amount equal to forest s cost of providing the equivalent detailing calls 
in june  we announced the initiation of our second development program  wherein we are evaluating potential pharmaceutical treatments for obstructive sleep apnea  or osa 
we entered into three licensing agreements to support and facilitate the program 
specifically  we licensed mirtazapine related patents from organon ireland ltd  and patents from two other parties that provide the opportunity to combine mirtazapine with a second approved agent with the goal of potentially augmenting efficacy and improving tolerability 
the series of licenses will allow cypress to evaluate a number of potential osa treatment modalities in proof of concept trials 
upon execution of the license agreement with organon  we issued to organon as a license fee a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 
under the agreement with organon  cypress and organon will jointly fund development activities in the event a candidate from the proof of concept trials has been selected for continued development 
if we are able to select a development candidate  the following is the structure of our agreement with organon 
we will have operational control of the development activities and  depending on the candidate selected  will fund or of the development related expenses 
if the fda approves this product  organon will have operational control of sales and marketing activities  with cypress having the opportunity to co promote up to of the physician promotion and details using its own sales force in the united states  mexico and canada 
expenses and revenue in the united states  mexico and canada are to be s hared between cypress and organon based on the level of promotional effort each party contributes  with cypress having the ability to share up to or depending on the candidate selected 
organon will be solely responsible for commercialization in the rest of the world and will pay cypress a royalty on net sales 
assuming the decision is made by cypress and organon to proceed with the commencement of the first phase iii clinical trial  at any time thereafter  either cypress or organon may elect to change the structure of the financial agreement to provide that the party that makes such election will no longer share in expenses and revenue  and instead will have the potential right to receive potential milestone and royalty payments in the even t a product is commercialized 
in connection with our related licensing transactions with two other parties  cypress paid the parties aggregate license payments totaling million  with the potential for additional milestone payments of up to million related to our osa program  as development progresses 
the parties will also participate in royalties from any marketed products that may be developed under the respective agreements 
cypress and organon have each independently initiated phase iia trials that will serve as the basis for selecting the product candidate  if any  for further clinical development 
the companies expect the phase iia trials and subsequent joint development and planning meetings to run through at least the first half of  which is also the earliest a development candidate to be evaluated in further trials could be selected 
we are continuing to evaluate other various potential strategic transactions  including the potential acquisitions of products  technologies and companies  and other alternatives 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million and an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and market new products for the treatment of functional somatic syndromes  such as fms  and other central nervous system disorders 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues we recognized revenues under our collaborative agreement of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues under our collaborative agreement is due to a decrease in sponsored development reimbursements during for costs incurred in connection with the first phase iii trial  which was completed during the second half of  and the elimination of funding from forest laboratories for certain of our employees devoted to the development of milnacipran as of the fourth quarter in this decrease in revenues under our collaborative agreement was partially offset by an increase in sponsored development reimbursements during for costs incurred in connection with the extension trial to our first phase iii trial  which commenced during the third quarter of and had a full year of activity during the revenues recorded during and consist solely of amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories for the development and marketing of milnacipran  entered into in january such revenues include the recognition of the upfront payment of million from forest laboratories on a straight line basis over a period of years  sponsored development reimbursements and funding received from forest laboratories during for certain of our employees devoted to the development of milnacipran 
we currently are not generating any revenues from product sales and we do not expect to generate revenues from product sales for at least the next several years  if at all 
unless and until we generate revenues from product sales  we expect our revenues to consist of the continued recognition on a straight line basis of the upfront payment of million and sponsored development reimbursements 
we may also recognize future milestone payments under our agreement with forest laboratories  which are contingent upon the achievement of agreed upon objectives and which are not guaranteed payments 
in connection with our arrangement with forest laboratories regarding cost sharing arrangements for the second phase iii trial only  the amount of funding that we receive from forest laboratories for certain of our employees was eliminated as of the fourth quarter in additionally  the amount of sponsored development reimbursements from forest laboratories may change periodically based on the level of development activity 
our collaboration agreement is subject to early termination by forest laboratories upon specified events  including breach of the agreement 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to costs incurred during in connection with the extension trial to our first phase iii trial  which commenced during the third quarter of and had a full year of activity during  and our second phase iii trial for milnacipran  which commenced during the fourth quarter of and had a full year of activity during  payment of license fees of million and a non cash charge of million incurred due to the issuance of a warrant to organon in connection with the licensing agreement related to our osa program and costs incurred in connection with various proof of concept studies for our sleep apnea program 
this increase in research and development expenses during was partially offset by several non recurring expenses incurred in  including a million sublicense fee paid to pierre fabre recorded during the first quarter of in connection with our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories and a payment for the exercise of our option in january to acquire an exclusive license to technology developed under our reformulation and new product agreement with collegium  and a decrease during in costs incurred in connection with the first phase iii trial  which was completed during the second half of during  we incurred total costs of million in connection with our phase iii programs compared to a total of million including the million sublicense fee to pierre fabre during the costs for the first phase iii clinical trial and extension trial are being reimbursed by forest laboratories as noted below 
effective january   pursuant to our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  forest laboratories assumed responsibility for funding all continuing development of milnacipran  including the funding of clinical trials and regulatory approvals 
this funding received from forest laboratories for sponsored development reimbursements is included as a component of our revenue under collaborative agreement on the statement of operations 
we agreed upon an alternative cost sharing arrangement with forest laboratories for the second phase iii trial only 
in connection with this arrangement  we will pay for a majority of the external costs of the second phase iii trial only  with forest reimbursing us under specific scenarios where the second phase iii trial is used as one of the two required pivotal trials in the nda submission to the fda 
in addition  as discussed below in non cash compensation charges  we recognized non cash compensation expense of  and  related to research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as discussed below in compensation benefit variable stock options  we recognized a compensation benefit for variable stock options of and  related to research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to non recurring costs incurred during  consisting of a success based fee paid to our investment bankers in connection with the closing of our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories in january and a one time fee associated with our being listed during the first quarter of on the nasdaq national market  and lower consulting fees and travel expenses during in connection with business development activities 
this decrease in general and administrative expenses during was partially offset by a success based fee paid to advisors during the second quarter of in connection with the closing of our licensing agreement with organon 
in addition  as discussed below in non cash compensation charges  we recognized non cash compensation expense of  and million related to general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as discussed below in compensation benefit variable stock options  we recognized a compensation benefit for variable stock options of million and  related to general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
non cash compensation charges non cash compensation charges for the year ended december  were  consisting of approximately  related to research and development expenses and  related to general and administrative expenses  compared to million  consisting of approximately  related to research and development expenses and million related to general and administrative expenses  for the year ended december  the decrease in non cash compensation charges is primarily due to non recurring  non cash compensation charges recorded during the first quarter of  consisting of million related to stock options previously granted to consultants and two former board members for services that vested upon the completion of the collaboration agreement with forest laboratories and million in connection with the accounting treatment for stock options related to the resignation of certain board members to roles as consultants during the first quarter of  as well as a decrease in the black scholes valuation for stock options granted to consultants due to the overall decrease in our stock price experienced during compensation benefit variable stock options in june  we implemented an option cancel and re grant program  which resulted in variable accounting for the newly issued options under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transaction involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb during the year ended december   as the intrinsic value of the common stock underlying the options declined due to a decrease in our stock price during the period  we recognized a compensation benefit of million  consisting of related to research and development expenses and million related to general and administrative expenses 
similarly  due to a decrease in our stock price during the year ended december   we recognized a compensation benefit of  consisting of  related to research and development expenses and  related to general and administrative expenses 
in the event our stock price is above closing price on december  on march   we will record additional compensation charges however  we cannot predict what our stock price will be in the future and it may be substantially lower than 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest income for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in is due to higher cash and investment balances during and a general increase in interest rates and related yields experienced during comparison of years ended december  and revenues we recognized revenues under our collaborative agreement of million for the year ended december  compared to no revenue for the year ended december  the revenues recorded during consist solely of amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories for the development and marketing of milnacipran  entered into in january such revenues include the recognition of the upfront payment of million from forest laboratories on a straight line basis over a period of years  funding received from forest laboratories for certain of our employees devoted to the development of milnacipran and sponsored development reimbursements 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses is primarily attributable to increased costs in connection with our first phase iii clinical trial for milnacipran due to a full year of activity during and costs incurred during in connection with the extension trial and our second phase iii trial for milnacipran 
during  we incurred total costs of million in connection with our phase iii programs compared to a total of million during research and development expenses during included a non cash charge in the amount of million recognized during the second quarter of in connection with the issuance of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to pierre fabre under the restated pierre fabre agreement and costs incurred during the first quarter of related to the phase ii clinical trial for milnacipran  which was in its final completion stage during the first quarter of the costs for the first phase iii clinical trial and extension trial incurred during are being reimbursed by forest laboratories 
in addition  as discussed below in non cash compensation charges  we recognized non cash compensation expense of  and  related to research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as discussed below in compensation expense benefit variable stock options  we recognized a compensation benefit for variable stock options of  and compensation expense for variable stock options of  related to research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to a success based fee paid to our investment bankers in connection with the closing of our collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  a one time fee associated with our being listed during the first quarter of on the nasdaq national market  increased wages and benefits expense associated with an increase in headcount  increased consulting fees and travel expenses in connection with business development activities surrounding potential strategic transactions and increased business insurance costs 
in addition  as discussed below in non cash compensation charges  we recognized non cash compensation expense of million and  related to general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively  and as discussed below in compensation expense benefit variable stock options  we recognized a compensation benefit for variable stock options of  and compensation expense for variable stock options of million related to general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  respectively 
non cash compensation charges non cash compensation charges for the year ended december  were million  consisting of approximately  related to research and development expenses and million related to general and administrative expenses  compared to  consisting of approximately  related to research and development expenses and  related to general and administrative expenses  for the year ended december  the increase in non cash compensation charges is primarily due to i non recurring  non cash compensation charges recognized during the first quarter of  consisting of million related to stock options previously granted to consultants and two former board members for services that vested upon the execution of the collaboration agreement with forest laboratories and million related to the accounting treatment for stock options in connection with the resignation of certain board members to roles as consultants during the first quarter of  ii a non recurring  non cash compensation charge in the amount of  recognized during the second quarter of related to the issuance of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to an outside consultant as compensation for services provided  and iii an increase in the black scholes valuation for stock options previously granted to consultants due to the overall average increase in our stock price 
these options are being expensed over their related vesting period 
compensation expense benefit variable stock options in connection with the option cancel and re grant program implemented in  which resulted in variable accounting for the newly issued options under fin  we recognized a compensation benefit of  consisting of  related to research and development expenses and  related to general and administrative expenses  during the year ended december  as the intrinsic value of the common stock underlying the options declined due to a decrease in our stock price during the period 
in contrast  due to an increase in our stock price during the year ended december   we recognized compensation expense of million  consisting of  related to research and development expenses and million related to general and administrative expenses 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in interest income for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in is due to higher cash and investment balances during achieved primarily through the upfront payment received from forest laboratories in january and the proceeds from our secondary offering completed in april  and a general increase in interest rates and related yields experienced during liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  working capital at december  totaled million compared to million at december  we have invested a substantial portion of our available cash in high quality marketable debt instruments of governmental agencies and certificates of deposit  which are within federally insured limits 
we have established guidelines relating to our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the primary use of cash during were actual expenditures to fund our operating activities during the period  offset by net collections of amounts due from forest laboratories 
the primary source of cash from operations during was the upfront payment of million received from forest laboratories  offset by cash used in operations of approximately million 
net cash provided by investing activities was  for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  the much smaller amount in net cash from investing activities during compared to was primarily a result of the purchase of short term securities during with the proceeds from the secondary offering of our common stock completed during april net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during compared was primarily the result of proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of stock options and warrants during compared to proceeds of approximately million from the completion of our public offering of common stock during april and proceeds of approximately million from the exercise of stock options and warrants during the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations at december  total less than year years after years operating leases purchase obligations total purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services  including consulting services  that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms 
this includes contracts that are cancelable with notice and the payment of an early termination penalty 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty and also exclude liabilities to the extent presented on the balance sheet as of december  other commercial commitments include certain potential milestone  sublicense and royalty payments to pierre fabre and other parties from whom we licensed patents in connection with our osa program as discussed in the overview section and milestone payments of up to million to collegium pharmaceutical  inc in connection with the reformulation and new product agreement entered into with collegium 
contractual obligations for which we will be reimbursed by forest laboratories are not included in the table above 
the above also does not include the external costs of the second phase iii trial for fms that we have agreed to fund 
unless and until we can consistently generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources that were primarily generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities and from revenue under our collaboration agreement with forest and if available to us  cash from financings 
we currently have a shelf registration statement on file that would allow us to issue up to million in shares but we do not have any current intentions to engage in a financing and no current intended purchasers 
additionally  in connection with the sale of most of our assets related to the prosorba column to fresenius hemocare in january  a contingent payment is due to us on january  in the amount of million if sales during the first seven years exceed  units  million if they exceed  units and none if the sales are less than  units 
our current expected primary cash needs on both a short term and long term basis are for the development of current products  working capital and other general corporate purposes and the identification  acquisition or license  and development of potential future products 
in addition to the amounts required to pay any amounts payable under our agreements with pierre fabre and collegium  the costs of in licensing or acquiring additional compounds or companies and funding clinical development for any product other than our fms or osa product that we may in license or acquire  we estimate that based on our current business plan  which now includes the development of a candidate for osa  we will require approximately million to fund our operations for the year one of our ongoing goals is to identify and in license new products 
in the event we acquire  license or develop any new products  the amount to fund our operations for would increase  possibly materially 
our net losses will continue for at least the next several years as we seek to acquire  license or develop additional products for the treatment of functional somatic syndromes and other central nervous system disorders 
such losses may fluctuate  and the fluctuations may be substantial 
based on our current business plan  we believe our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances at december  are sufficient to fund operations for at least the next year 
however  we are actively continuing to evaluate various potential strategic transactions  including the potential acquisitions of products and companies  and other alternatives 
in order to acquire or develop additional products  we will require additional capital 
the amount of capital we require is dependent upon many forward looking factors that could significantly increase our capital requirements  including the following the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products and businesses  the costs of in licensing drug candidates  the ability of forest laboratories and us to reach milestones  and other events or developments under our collaboration agreement  the ability of organon and our other osa related collaborators to reach milestones  and other events or developments under our collaboration agreements  the costs and timing of development and regulatory approvals for milnacipran and our osa product candidate  and the costs of commercialization of any future products 
because we are unable to predict the outcome of the foregoing factors  some of which are beyond our control  we are unable to estimate with certainty our mid to long term capital needs 
unless and until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue  if ever  we expect to finance future capital needs through public or private debt or equity offerings or collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as interest income earned on cash balances 
we do not currently have any commitments or specific plans for future external funding 
we may not be able to raise additional capital and the funds we raise  if any  may not allow us to maintain our current and planned operations 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development of existing or future product candidates 
to date  we have not had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  research and development expenses and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies that affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements see also the notes to our financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab  revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
amounts received for upfront license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
accordingly  the upfront payment of million from forest laboratories is being recognized over a period of years  which represents the estimated period of significant on going services and performance  including the development period  under our agreement with forest laboratories 
amounts received for sponsored development activities  including funding received for certain of our employees  are recognized as research costs are incurred over the period specified in the related agreement or as the services are performed 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone  which requires substantive effort and was not readily assured at the inception of the agreement 
any amounts received prior to satisfying revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for our research and development personnel  fees paid to external service providers to conduct clinical trials  patient enrollment costs  fees and milestone payments under our license and development agreements and costs for facilities  supplies  materials and equipment 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
we accrue clinical trial expenses based on work performed  which relies on estimates of total costs incurred based on completion of patient studies and other events 
actual clinical trial costs may differ from estimated clinical trial costs and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
historically  adjustments have not resulted in material changes to research and development expenses  however  a modification in the protocol of a clinical trial or cancellation of a trial could result in a charge to our results of operations 
stock based compensation we grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  we ordinarily recognize no compensation expense for stock option grants to employees provided that the option exercise price is not less than the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
the value of options or stock awards issued to non employees has been determined in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods and services  and is periodically re measured as the options vest 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded compensation expense of  and million including million related to stock options that vested upon the execution of the collaboration agreement with forest laboratories  respectively  related to options issued to consultants 
additionally  during the year ended december   we recorded compensation expense of million in connection with the accounting treatment for stock options related to the resignation of certain board members during the first quarter of and compensation expense of  in connection with the issuance of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to an outside consultant as compensation for services provided 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows sfas 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r must be adopted no later than january  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
the company will adopt sfas r on january  as permitted by sfas  we currently account for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
determining the exact impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future and the assumptions for the variables which affect the computation 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net loss and net loss per share in note to our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have invested our excess cash in united states government securities  certificates of deposit and money market funds with strong credit ratings 
as a result  our interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level of united states interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the investment grade securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
