actual results may differ materially from those included in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include those set forth under factors that could affect our operating results  as well as those otherwise discussed in this section and elsewhere in this annual report

business overview the following discussion and analysis is intended to provide an investor with a narrative of our financial results and an evaluation of our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated condensed financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december  our revenue mix contains ip licensing fees  per unit royalties and support fees 
we have built a strong customer base who rely on our technology to deploy their silicon solutions 
we license our technology as ip to semiconductor companies who manufacture  market and sell dsp application specific integrated circuits asics and application specific standard products assps based on ceva technology to systems companies for incorporation into a wide variety of end products 
our ip is primarily deployed in high volume markets  including wireless handsets eg cellular baseband and multimedia solutions  portable multimedia eg portable video players and portable audio players  home entertainment eg dvd  storage eg hard disk drives  automotive eg global positioning systems gps  bluetooth handsfree communication car kits and telematics and communication markets eg high speed serial storage 
our current primary focus is dsp cores and application specific software video  audio  imaging and voice for the cellular handset market with sales of our dsps and related technologies representing a majority of our total revenues for today our technologies are widely licensed and power some of the world s leading wireless and consumer electronics brands including atmel  broadcom  eonex  freescale  fujitsu  hitachi  infineon  macronix  marvell  maxim  national semiconductor  nvidia  oki  philips  renesas  rohm  samsung  sharp  silicon laboratories  sony  spreadtrum  stmicroelectronics  thomson  via  zoran and more 
in our licensees shipped over million ceva powered chips  an increase of over shipments of million units 
ceva is the leading licensor of dsp cores 
in  gartner dataquest reported ceva s share of the licensable dsp market at 
with many of our customers committed to our dsp architecture  we have seen many customers choosing to re license and upgrade their licenses for ceva dsp cores 
our legacy ceva oak dsp  the ceva teak  ceva teaklite and most recently  ceva teaklite ii are all code compatible  meaning customers can leverage their knowledge in developing products incorporating these dsp cores across a wide range of applications 
in recent years  we have introduced a new dsp architecture  the ceva x dsp core 
we recognized a need in the dsp market for a more powerful  programmable and scalable dsp in order to meet the industry shift towards more fully featured and smaller form factor products 
in addition  there has been an industry shift towards licensing this type of technology as opposed to developing it in house  due to the design cycle time constantly shortening and the cost of ownership and maintenance of such architectures 
in recent times  the industry has indicated a clear shift in customer preference away from the traditional approach of licensing standalone dsps  and towards licensing highly integrated application platforms incorporating all the necessary hardware and software for their target applications 
we believe that the growth in the demand for these platforms will drive demand for our technology 
as ceva offers expertise developing these complete solutions in a number of key growth markets  including mobile multimedia  audio and gps  we believe we are well positioned to take full advantage of these major industry shifts 
however  we need to penetrate new markets and introduce new products to further expand our business 
in that regard  the most important step we have taken is the initiation to penetrate the mobile multimedia market 
we introduced our first multimedia platform for wireless handsets in  mobile media  and in we have announced and released a second generation mobile multimedia platform  the mobile media  which targets a broad range of applications and devices 
our future growth is substantially dependent on our success in penetrating the asian handset market and the general market deployment and acceptance of our software programmable multimedia products 
nonetheless  our business operates in a highly competitive environment 
competition has historically increased pricing pressures for our products and decreased our average selling prices 
in order to penetrate new markets and maintain our market share with our existing products  we may need to offer our products in the future at lower prices which may result in lower profits 
our future growth is dependent not only on the continued success of our existing products but also the successful introduction of new products 
moreover  we must continue to monitor and control our operating costs and to maintain our current level of gross margin in order to offset future declines in average selling prices 
in addition  since our products are incorporated into end products of our oem customers  our business is very dependent on their ability to achieve market acceptance of their end products in consumer electronic markets  which are similarly very competi tive 
we operate in a changing market that challenges our continued business growth potential 
for example  the success of our video products are highly dependent on the adoption of new services  such as mobile tv and high resolution streaming video  and the rate of adoption of gps technology for handset applications is dependent on network operators introducing more gps applications 
in addition  our business may be affected by market conditions in the apac region  specifically china  where we anticipate the most significant growth potential for our business 
our revenues are currently primarily generated from sales of chipsets used in cellular handsets 
as a result  a decline in the market for the sale of cellular handsets would adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
in view of the current market trends  our planned future products are anticipated to enable true mobile multimedia integration into cellular handsets and the possible inclusion of technologies  such as gps  into these products 
we believe that these pioneer solutions will allow us to provide the desired flexibility for wireless semiconductors 
we cannot provide any assurances  however that these features will achieve market acceptance  and allow us to maintain our market share or provide for our future growth 
we believe that our introduction of additional features  such as advances in our video technology  high end audio technologies and home entertainment applications will also contribute to our growth in future periods 
in addition  we are taking several steps to penetrate additional markets  including china  korea and taiwan with our existing products 
however  our ability to introduce new products and expand into new markets may not occur and may require us to substantially increase our operating expenses 
as a result  our past operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our report ed financial results include the following revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts accounting for income taxes impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets reorganization  restructuring and severance charge foreign currency in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period 
material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management s estimates change on the basis of development of the business or market conditions 
management judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically 
we generate our revenues from licensing intellectual property  which in certain circumstances is modified to customer specific requirements  royalty income and other revenues  which include revenues from support  training and consulting services 
we licenses our ip to semiconductor companies throughout the world 
these semiconductor companies then manufacture  market and sell custom designed chips to original equipment manufacturers of a variety of electronic products 
we also license our technology directly to oems  which are considered end users 
we account for our ip license revenues in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
under the terms of sop  revenues are recognized when collection is probable  delivery has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and no further obligation exists 
sop generally requires revenue earned on licensing arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
however  we have adopted sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  for multiple element transactions 
sop requires that revenue be recognized under the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements and vsoe does not exist for one of the delivered elements 
the vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements technical support and training is determined based on the renewal rate or on the price charged for the undelivered element when sold separately 
sop specifies that extended payment terms in a licensing arrangement may indicate that the license fees are not deemed to be fixed or determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer unless collection is not considered probable  then revenue is recognized as payments are collected from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our revenue recognition policy determines all arrangements that become due after months as extended payments and revenue is recognized as each payment becomes due  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
sop specifies that if a company has a standard business practice of using extended payment terms in licensing arrangements and has a history of successfully collecting the license fees under the original terms of the licensing arrangement without mak ing concessions  the company should recognize the license fees when all other sop revenue recognition criteria are met 
we have concluded that certain arrangements in prior years with extended payment terms over twelve months meet these criteria 
under certain circumstances revenue consists of license fees received under the terms of license agreements pursuant to which we modify our ip to that customer s specific requirements 
our ip consists of software and related documentation that enable a customer to produce integrated circuits and related technology and software 
in general the time between the signing of such a license and final customer acceptance is between three and twelve months 
fees are payable upon completion of agreed upon milestones  such as delivery of specifications and technical documentation 
each license is designed to meet the specific requirements of the particular customer and can vary from rights to incorporate company technology into a customer s own application specific product to the complete design of a system on a chip 
no upgrades or modifications to the licensed ip are provided 
following customer acceptance  we have no further obl igations under the license agreement other than pursuant to a separate service and support agreement 
revenues from license fees that involve customization of the company s ip to customer specific specifications are recognized in accordance with the principles set out in statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  sop using contract accounting on a percentage of completion method  in accordance with the input method 
the amount of revenue recognized is based on the total project fees including the license fee and the customization hours charged under the agreement and the percentage of completion achieved 
the percentage of completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared to the total estimated project requirements  which corresponds to the costs related to earned revenues 
estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of cus tomization  delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are first determined  in the amount of the estimated loss on the entire contract 
as december   no such losses were identified 
estimated gross profit or loss from long term contracts may change due to changes in estimates resulting from differences between actual performance and original forecasts 
such changes in estimated gross profit are recorded in results of operations when they are reasonably determinable by us  on a cumulative catch up basis 
we believe that the use of the percentage of completion method is appropriate as we have both prior experience and the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs 
in addition  contracts executed include provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding services to be provided and received by the parties to the contracts  the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement 
in all cases we expect to perform our contractual obligations and our licensees are expected to satisfy their obligations under the contract 
when a sale of our ip is made to a third party who also supplies us with goods or services under separate agreements  we evaluate each of the agreements to determine whether they are clearly separable  and independent of one another and that reliable fair value exists for either the sales or purchase element in order to determine the appropriate revenue recognition 
royalties from licensing the right to use the company s ip are recognized when the related sales are made 
the company determines such sales by receiving confirmation of sales subject to royalties from licensees 
non refundable payments on account of future royalties are recognized upon payment  provided that no future obligation exists 
prepaid royalties are recognized under the licensing revenue line 
allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a detailed review of all significant outstanding receivables 
in determining the provision  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
we reassess these allowances each accounting period 
historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
if actual payment experience with our customers is different than our estimates  adjustments to these allowances may be necessary resulting in additional charges to our statement of operations 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters may be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income loss in the period in which such determination is made 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using enacted tax rates for the effects of net operating losses and temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we have provided a valuation allowance on the majority of our net deferred tax assets  which includes federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses in certain jurisdictions and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
we provide valuation allowances in respect of deferred tax assets r esulting principally from the carryforward of tax losses 
we currently believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax regarding the carryforward of losses and certain accrued expenses will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 
we do not provide for us federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries because such earnings are re invested and  in our opinion  will continue to be re invested indefinitely 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions involving complex issues and we provide for tax liabilities on investment activity as appropriate 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and may be subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time for resolution 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with an identifiable useful life are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests based on estimated fair value in accordance with sfas no 
we conduct our annual test of impairment for goodwill in october of each year 
in addition we test for impairment periodically whenever events or circumstances occur subsequent to our annual impairment tests that indicate that the asset might be impaired 
indicators we considered important which could trigger an impairment include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
in october  we engaged external consultants to assist us in the preparation of the annual goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compared the carrying value of the company the reporting unit with its fair value on that date 
since the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount  no impairment was identified in in october  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test and assessed the carrying value of goodwill as required by sfas no 
because the market capitalization exceeded the carrying value significantly  no impairment arose 
other intangible assets other intangible assets represents costs of technology acquired from acquisitions which have reached technological feasibility 
the costs of technology have been capitalized and are amortized to the consolidated statements of operations over the period during which economic benefits are expected to accrue  currently estimated at five years 
we are required to test our other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of the assets may be impaired 
factors we consider important  which could trigger impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
where events and circumstances are present which indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  we will recognize an impairment loss 
such impairment loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires us to make assumptions regarding future business conditions and operating results in order to estimate future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record additional impairment charges 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in the second quarter of in respect of bluetooth technology acquired in the combination with parthus technologies plc parthus as the company has decided to cease the development of this product line due to the minimal differentiation between competing solutions 
we also recorded a million impairment charge in in respect of certain technology acquired in the combination with parthus  the parthus name  which we abandoned as part of our corporate re branding  and steps connected with the realignment of our business  including the decision to cease hard ip manufacturing and certain non strategic technology areas 
the impairment charges reflected the unamortized carrying value of the technology determined by an independent analysis on the combination with parthus 
reorganization  restructuring and severance charge we had reorganization and restructuring plans in and which resulted in a total charge of million and million  respectively 
we were required to make and are required to review certain estimates and assumptions in assessing the under utilized building operating lease charges arising from the reduction in facility requirements 
management takes into account current market conditions and the ability of the company to either exit the lease property or sub let the property in determining the estimates and assumptions used 
in the third quarter of  we conducted exit negotiations with the landlord of one of our properties in ireland 
we consequently updated the accrual for this property to reflect an exit strategy  resulting in a net additional charge of million in the third quarter 
at december   exit negotiations had not concluded and we were required to update our accrual for this property on a sub let basis 
management revised their assumptions at december  in respect of future vacancy rates and sublet rents in light of current market conditions and their discount rate based on projected interest rates applicable 
there was no additional charge to the income statement during the fourth quarter of however  if we are successful in surrendering our long term lease relating to this property  we would expect an associated cash outflow of approximately million in revisions to our estimates of this liability could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and assumptions either change or do not materialize 
if an exit strategy in respect of a leased property is appropriate  the under utilized building operating lease charge is calculated taking into consideration the surrender value based on a multiple of annual outgoings given the underlying market conditions 
otherwise  the under utilized building operating lease charge is calculated on a sub let basis by taking into consideration the committed annual rental charge associated with the vacant square footage  an assessment of the sublet rents that could be achieved based on current market conditions  vacancy rates and future outlook  the estimated periods that facilities would be empty before being sublet  an assessment of the percentage increases in the primary lease rent and the sublease rent at each five year rent review  and the application of a discount rate of over the remaining period of the lease 
the company expects to revise its assumptions quarterly  as approp riate in respect of future vacancy rates and sublet rents in light of current market conditions and the applicable discount rate based on projected interest rates 
foreign currency the us dollar is the functional and reporting currency for the company 
the majority of our revenues and a portion of our expenses are transacted in us dollars and our assets and liabilities together with our cash holdings are predominately denominated in us dollars 
however  a significant portion of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro and the israeli nis 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured into us dollars at year end exchange rates while revenues and expenses are remeasured at rates approximating those ruling at the dates of the related transactions 
increases in the volatility of the exchange rates of the euro and the nis versus the us dollar could have an adverse effect on the expenses and liabilities that we incur when translated into us dollars 
we review our monthly expected non us dollar denominated expenditure and l ook to hold equivalent non us dollar cash balances to mitigate currency fluctuations and this has resulted in a foreign exchange gain of  and  in and  respectively 
we incurred foreign exchange losses of approximately  in arising principally on euro liabilities as a result of the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar 
as a result of such currency fluctuations and the conversion to us dollars for financial reporting purposes  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results on an annual and a quarterly basis going forward 
we have not in the past  but may in the future  hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates 
future hedging transactions may not successfully mitigate losses caused by currency fluctuations 
we expect to continue to experience the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on an annual and quarterly basis  and currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share base payment fas r which revises the previously effective sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
fas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based upon their fair values  beginning with the first interim or annual period after december   with early adoption encouraged 
we have the option to choose either the modified prospective or modified retrospective method 
we expect to adopt fas r in the first quarter of  using the modified prospective method of adoption which requires that compensation expense be recorded over the expected requisite service period of all unvested stock options and for any new grants thereof upon adoption of fas r 
we are currently evaluating the impact fas r will have on the company  and based on our preliminary analysis  expect to incur additional compensation expense as a result of the adoption of this new accounting standard that may be material to the financial statements 
had we adopted fas r in prior periods  the impact of that statement would have approximated the impact of fas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share of common stock in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in march  the sec released sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
sab provides the sec staff s position regarding the application of sfas r and contains interpretive guidance related to the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  and also provides the sec staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
sab highlights the importance of disclosures made relating to the accounting for share based payment transactions 
we are currently reviewing the effect of sab  however we believe that sab will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no

 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
apb no 
previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principles be recognized by including in net income for the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas requires retroactive application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principles unless it is impracticable 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas wi ll not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition

because of the nature of our license agreements and the associated large initial payments due  the identity of major customers generally varies from quarter to quarter 
we generate royalties from our licensing activities in two manners royalties paid by our customers over the period in which they ship units which we refer to as per unit royalties and royalties which are paid in a lump sum which cover a fixed number of future unit shipments which we refer to as prepaid royalties 
in either case  these prepaid royalties are non refundable payments and are recognized upon invoicing for payment  provided that no future obligation exists 
prepaid royalties are recognized under our licensing revenue line and accounted for of total revenue in and and of total revenue in only royalty revenue from customers who are paying as they ship units is recognized in our royalty revenue line

research and development expenses are net of related government research grants 
we view research and development as a principal strategic investment and have continued our commitment to invest heavily in this area  which represents the largest of our ongoing operating expenses 
we will need to continue to invest in research and development and our research and development expenses may increase in the future to keep pace with new trends in our industry

the reduction in headcount and facility requirements was a result of the realignment of the business to focus on dsp cores and integrated application technologies and the decision to cease manufacturing our hard ip products and certain non strategic technology areas 
we were required to make and are required to review certain estimates and assumptions in assessing the under utilized building operating lease charges arising from the reduction in facility requirements 
management takes into account current market conditions and the ability of the company to either exit the lease property or sub let the property in determining the estimates and assumptions used 
the company expects to revise its assumptions quarterly  as appropriate in respect of future vacancy rates and sublet rents in light of current market conditions and the applicable discount rate based on projected interest rates 
in the third quarter of  we conducted exit negotiations with the landlord of one of our properties in ireland 
we consequently updated the accrual for this property to reflect an exit strategy  resulting in a net additional charge of million in the third quarter 
at december   exit negotiations had not concluded and we were required to update our accrual for this property on a sub let basis 
there was no additional charge to the income statement during the fourth quarter of however  if we are successful in surrendering our long term lease relating to this property  we would expect an associated cash outflow of approximately million in revisions to our estimates of this liability could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and assumptions either change or do not materialize 
impairment of assets impairment of assets in millions we recorded an impairment charge of in the second quarter of in respect of bluetooth technology acquired in the combination with parthus technologies plc parthus as we have decided to cease the development of this product line due to the minimal differentiation between competing solutions 
we also recorded an impairment charge of in the same period relating to non performing assets following the implementation of our reorganization plan 
we recorded an impairment charge of  in in respect of non performing assets  as well as an impairment charge of  in respect of certain technology acquired in the combination with parthus and the parthus name  which we abandoned as part of our corporate rebranding 
these charges related to the realignment of our business  including the decision to cease manufacturing hard ip products and certain non strategic technology areas 
in december  we also recognized an impairment charge of million in relation to a minority investment in a private company acquired on the combination with parthus 
management assessed the carrying value of the investment after taking into consideration the potential discounted projected future cash flows  the valuation derived from the most recent proposed private placement  the liquidity of the investment and the general market conditions in which this private company operates 
financial income  net and other income financial income  net in millions of which interest income and gains from marketable securities in millions foreign exchange gain loss in millions other income gain on realization of investment in millions financial income  net and other income  consists of interest earned on investments  gains from marketable securities  foreign exchange movements and gain on disposal of investment 
the increase in interest and gains from marketable securities earned in from reflects a combination of a higher interest rate environment and higher combined cash and marketable securities balances held 
interest earned in and reflected similar combined cash and marketable securities balances held throughout and we recorded a gain of million in the third quarter of from the realization of a minority investment in a private company acquired in the combination with parthus 
in december  we had fully written down the carrying value of the investment having assessed the carrying value of the investment taking into consideration the potential discounted projected future cash flows  the valuation derived from the most recent proposed private placement  the liquidity of the investment and the general market conditions in which this private company operated at that time 
provision for income taxes we had no provision for income taxes in primarily due to losses incurred domestically and in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the provision for income taxes in and reflects income earned domestically and in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we have significant operations in israel and the republic of ireland and a substantial portion of our taxable income is generated there 
currently  our israeli and irish subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than us tax rates 
the irish operating subsidiary currently qualifies for a tax rate  which under current legislation will remain in force until december  the israeli operating subsidiary s production facilities have been granted approved enterprise status under israeli law in connection with six separate investment plans 
accordingly  income from an approved enterprise is tax exempt for a period of two or four years and is subject to a reduced corporate tax rate of ten percent to twenty five percent based on percentage of foreign ownership for an additional period of six or eight years 
certain expenditure in connection with the investment plans is allowable as a tax deduction over a three year period which has resulted in higher deferred tax asset in liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million in deposits and marketable securities  totaling million compared to million at december  during  the company invested million of its cash in certificates of deposits and us government and agency securities with maturities up to months 
in addition  certificates of deposits and us government and agency securities were sold for cash amounting to million 
during  the company made a net investment of million of its cash in certificates of deposits and us government and agency securities with maturities up to months 
these instruments are classified as marketable securities and the purchases and sales are considered part of operating cash flow 
deposits are short term bank deposits with maturities of more than three months but less than one year 
the deposits are in u 
s 
dollars and are presented at their cost  including accrued interest and purchases and sales are considered part of cash flows from investing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million  compared with million of net cash used in operating activities in and million of net cash used in operating activities in included in the operating cash inflow in was a net disposal of million in marketable securities and million outflow in connection with restructuring and reorganization costs 
excluding these items net cash provided by operations during was million 
included in the operating cash outflow in was a net investment of million in marketable securities and million outflow in connection with restructuring and reorganization costs 
excluding these items net cash provided by operations during was million 
the net cash outflow from operating activities in of million included the settlement of merger related costs of approximately million following the combination with parthus a nd cash outflow in connection with restructuring and reorganization costs incurred in and the last quarter of amounting to approximately million 
cash flows from operating activities may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our receipts and payments 
of the million of restructuring and reorganization costs accrued at december   we expect a cash outflow of approximately million in  primarily relating to under utilized building rental payments 
however  if we are successful in surrendering our long term lease relating to an under utilized premises in ireland  we would expect an associated cash outflow of approximately million in our ongoing cash outflows from operating activities principally relate to payroll related costs and obligations under our property leases and design tool licenses 
our primary sources of cash inflows are receipts from our accounts receivable and interest earned from our cash and marketable securities holdings 
the timing of receipts from debtors is based upon the completion of agreed milestones or agreed dates as set out in the contracts 
ceva became a stand alone business in november  when the separation and spin off of the dsp cores licensing business from dspg and the combination with parthus were effected 
immediately prior to the separation and spin off  all of the year end available cash from the operations of the dsp cores licensing business was transferred to dspg 
as part of the assets contributed to us in the separation  dspg made a total net contribution to our company of million  including million in transaction expenses relating to the combination 
cash acquired in connection with the separation from dspg and on the acquisition of parthus has been used to fund working capital requirements  as well as property and equipment expenditures  which to date have been relatively low due to the fact that our licensing business model requires no manufacturing facilities 
net cash used in investing activities in was million 
capital equipment purchases of computer hardware and software used in engineering development  company vehicles  furniture and fixtures amounted to approximately million in  million in  and million in the high level of capital expenditures in and was principally due to investments in new design tools and tenant improvements associated with the move of our facility in israel to new premises in the fourth quarter of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment amounted to  in compared with  in and  in we had a cash outflow of  for acquired technology in and  and  for and  respectively 
we had a cash inflow of million from the disposal of a minority investment in a private company in and a cash outflow of million in respect of inves tment in short term bank deposits 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in  million in and  in reflects proceeds from the issuance of shares upon exercise of employee stock options and issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe that our current cash on hand and marketable securities  along with cash from operations  will provide sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we cannot assure you  however  that the underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses will prove to be accurate 
contractual obligations the table below presents the principal categories of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations leasehold properties operating lease obligations other purchase obligations total operating leasehold obligations principally relate to our offices in ireland  israel and the united states 
the most material of these obligations relates to the lease on our harcourt street offices in dublin  which involves a total commitment of million over the remaining sixteen years of the agreement 
a portion of rental space is currently under utilized as a result of the re alignment of our business and related headcount reductions in  which is further discussed in note to our audited financial statements  which appears elsewhere in this annual report 
other operating lease obligations relate to license agreements entered into for maintenance of design tools of million and obligations under motor vehicle leases of  purchase obligations consist of capital commitments of  and operating purchase order commitments of  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as such term is defined in recently enacted rules by the securities and exchange commission  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a majority of our revenues and a portion of our expenses are transacted in us dollars and our assets and liabilities together with our cash holdings are predominately denominated in us dollars 
however  the bulk of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro and the israeli nis 
increases in the volatility of the exchange rates of the euro and the nis versus the us dollar could have an adverse effect on the expenses and liabilities that we incur when remeasured into us dollars 
we review our monthly expected us dollar denominated expenditure and look to hold equivalent non us dollar cash balances to mitigate currency fluctuations and this has resulted in a foreign exchange gain of  and  in and  respectively 
we incurred foreign exchange losses of approximately  in  arising principally on euro liabilities as a result of the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar 
as a result of such currency fluctuations and the conversion to us dollars for financial reporting purposes  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results on an annual and a quarterly basis going forward 
we have not in the past  but may in the future  hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates 
future hedging transactions may not successfully mitigate losses caused by currency fluctuations 
we expect to continue to experience the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on an annual and quarterly basis  and currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we invest our cash in high grade certificates of deposits  us government and agency securities and corporate bonds 
cash held by foreign subsidiaries is generally held in short term time deposits denominated in the local currency 
interest income and gains from marketable securities were million in   in and  in the increase in interest and gains from marketable securities earned in from reflects a combination of a higher interest rate environment and higher combined cash and marketable securities balances held 
we are exposed primarily to fluctuations in the level of us and emu european monetary union interest rates 
to the extent that interest rates rise  fixed interest investments may be adversely impacted  whereas a decline in interest rates may decrease the anticipated interest income for variable rate investments 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposures on our investment securities because the majority of our investments are short term 
we do not have any derivative instruments 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of our investment portfolio 
all the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our balances as of december
