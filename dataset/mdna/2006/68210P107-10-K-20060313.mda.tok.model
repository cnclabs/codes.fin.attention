item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company appearing under item herein 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed 
such reclassifications do not affect earnings or stockholders equity 
general business 
omega is the largest us producer of protein rich meal and oil derived from marine sources 
the company s products are produced from menhaden a herring like fish found in commercial quantities  and include regular grade and value added specialty fish meals  crude and refined fish oils and fish solubles 
the company s fish meal products are used as nutritional feed additives by animal feed manufacturers and by commercial livestock producers 
the company s crude fish oil is sold to food producers and feed manufacturers  and its refined fish oil products are used in food production and certain industrial applications 
fish solubles are sold as protein additives for animal feed and as fertilizers 
fishing 
the company s harvesting season generally extends from may through december on the mid atlantic coast and from april through october on the gulf coast 
during the off season and the first few months of each fishing season  the company fills purchase orders from the inventory it has accumulated during the previous fishing season or in some cases  by re selling meal purchased from other suppliers 
on august   the company s moss point  mississippi fish processing facility and adjacent shipyard were severely damaged by hurricane katrina 
on september   the company s cameron  louisiana and abbeville  louisiana fish processing facilities were also severely damaged by hurricane rita 
each of these facilities was non operational immediately after these weather events 
operations at the moss point fish processing facility  the abbeville fish processing facility and the shipyard were re established in mid october   but at reduced processing capabilities 
the company is currently rebuilding its cameron  louisiana facility and expects it to be fully operational by mid the company currently estimates that its full contingent of gulf of mexico fishing vessels will begin the fishing season and will be capable of unloading its fish catch at the company s moss point and abbeville fish processing facilities 
although these facilities have adequate processing capacity  the company believes that fishing efforts may be diminished because increased unloading time due to additional vessels could keep some vessels off the fishing grounds during the most optimal fishing times 
the fish catch is processed into three general types of products  fish meal  fish oil and fish solubles at the company s four meal and oil processing plants  two in louisiana  one in mississippi and one in virginia 

index to financial statements harvesting and production 
the following table summarizes the company s harvesting and production for the indicated periods years ended december  fish catch tons production tons fish meal regular grade special select sea lac oil crude refined solubles total production fish catch has been converted to tons using the national marine fisheries service nmfs fish catch conversion ratio of pounds per  fish 
in  the company s total production was  tons of meal  oil and solubles 
during  and  the company experienced a poor fish catch approximately  and  respectively  below expectations and a similar reduction from actual results  combined with poor oil yields 
in  the reduced fish catch was primarily attributable to hurricanes katrina and rita and the subsequent loss of substantially all gulf operating capacity resulting from those hurricanes 
in and  the reduced fish catch was primarily attributable to adverse weather conditions and the poor oil yields were due to the reduced fat content of the fish 
as a result of the poor fish catch and reduced yields  the company experienced significantly higher per unit product costs approximately increase during compared to the impact of higher cost inventories and fewer volumes available for sale was carried forward and has adversely affected the company s earnings through the first and second quarters of during the third quarter of  the company suffered plant closures due to hurricanes katrina and rita 
the direct impact of the hurricanes upon the company was loss of physical inventories and physical damage to three plants 
the interruption of processing capabilities caused the company to address the impact of abnormal downtime of its processing facilities  which resulted in the immediate recognition of costs which would ordinarily have been captured as inventory costs 
the amounts of these losses were substantial and are more fully described in notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
markets 
pricing for the company s products has been volatile in the past several years and is attributable mainly to the international availability  or the perceived international availability  of fish meal and fish oil inventories 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  in fiscal the company embarked on a quality control program designed to increase its capability of producing higher quality fish meal products and  in conjunction therewith  enhanced it sales efforts to penetrate premium product markets 
since  the company s sales volumes of specialty meal products have increased approximately 
future volumetric growth in specialty meal sales will be dependant upon increased harvesting efforts and market demand 
additionally  the company is attempting to introduce its refined fish oil into the food market 
the company has made sales  which to date have not been material  of its refined fish oil  trademarked omegapure  to food manufacturers in the united states and canada at prices that provide substantially improved margins over the margins that can be obtained from selling non refined crude fish oil 
the company cannot estimate  however  the size of the actual domestic or international markets for omega pure or how long it may take to develop these markets 
during  the company developed a business plan to expand its purchase and resale of other manufacturers fish meal and fish oil products and engaged a full time consultant to implement the company s 
index to financial statements business plan which focused initially on the purchase and resale of mexican fish meal and fish oil 
in  revenues generated from these types of transactions represented less than of total company revenues 
during and again in  the company s fish catch and resultant product inventories were reduced  primarily due to adverse weather conditions 
the company supplemented its inventories and subsequent sales by purchasing other fish meal and oil products 
although operating margins from these activities are less than the margins typically generated from the company s base domestic production  these operations provide the company with a source of fish meal and oil to sell into other markets where the company has not historically had a presence 
the company purchased products totaling approximately  and  tons  or approximately and of total volume sales for the fiscal year ended december  and  respectively 
historically  approximately to of omega s faq fish meal was sold on a two to twelve month forward contract basis 
the balance of regular grade and other products was substantially sold on a spot basis through purchase orders 
the company began a similar forward sales program for its specialty grade meals and crude fish oil for due to increasing demand for these products 
during  and approximately  and respectively  of its specialty meals and crude fish oil had been sold on a forward contract basis 
the company s annual revenues are highly dependent on both annual fish catch and inventories and  in addition  inventory is generally carried over from one year to another year 
the company determines the level of inventory to be carried over based on prevailing market prices of the products and anticipated customer usage and demand during the off season 
thus  production volume does not necessarily correlate with sales volume in the same year and sales volumes will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the company s fish meal products have a useable life of approximately one year from date of production 
practically  however  the company typically attempts to empty its warehouses of the previous season s products by the second or third month of the new fishing season 
the company s crude fish oil products do not lose efficacy unless exposed to oxygen and therefore  their storage life typically is longer than that of fish meal 
the following table sets forth the company s revenues by product in millions and the approximate percentage of total revenues represented thereby  for the indicated periods years ended december  revenues percent revenues percent revenues percent regular grade special select sealac crude oil refined oil fish solubles total liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been cash flows from operations  bank credit facilities and term loans from various lenders provided pursuant to the national marine fisheries finance program under title xi of the marine act of title xi 
these sources of cash flows have been used for capital expenditures and payment of long term debt 
the company expects to finance future expenditures through internally generated cash flows and  if necessary  through funds available from the credit facility and or title xi facilities described below 
under a program offered through national marine fisheries services nmfs pursuant to title xi  the company has secured loans through lenders with terms generally ranging between and years at interest rates between and per annum which are enhanced with a government guaranty to the lender for up to 
index to financial statements of the financing 
the company s current title xi borrowings are secured by liens on fishing vessels and mortgages on the company s reedville  virginia and abbeville  louisiana plants 
in  title xi borrowing was modified to permit use of proceeds from borrowings obtained through this program for shoreside construction 
the company used the entire million amount originally authorized under the program 
loans are now available under similar terms pursuant to the title xi program without intervening lenders 
the company borrowed million under this new program during and borrowed an additional million title xi loan on december  on september   pursuant to the title xi program  the united states department of commerce approved a financing application made by the company in the amount of million the approval letter 
in december  the company submitted a million financing request to be drawn against the million approved financing application 
in  the company amended the request to include the entire million  and closed on this loan in october on december   pursuant to the title xi program  the united states department of commerce approved another financing application made by the company in the amount of million 
the company expects that this loan  or some portion of it  will close in the latter part of borrowings under this title xi program may be used for refurbishment of the company s fishing vessels and capital expenditures relating to the company s shore side fishing assets 
the title xi loans are secured by liens on certain of the company s fishing vessels and mortgages on the company s reedville  virginia and abbeville and cameron  louisiana plants 
omega had an unrestricted cash balance of million at december   down million from december  this decrease was due primarily to capital expenditures  purchase of additional property adjacent to the moss point  mississippi facility  and costs associated with the fishing season production and hurricane rebuilding efforts 
the company s liquidity is greatly influenced by the selling prices received for its products 
should the company experience decreased pricing in the future  as it experienced in and  liquidity would decline and the company would likely have to utilize its working capital credit facility 
additionally  as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita  the company suffered significant damages to property and equipment that will need to be repaired or replaced in the near future 
insurance proceeds are not expected to fully cover all of those costs and the remainder will be funded from the company s existing cash balances and credit facility 
the company s long term debt at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
current maturities attributable to the company s long term debt were and million at december  and december   respectively 
the company did not utilize its working capital credit facility during or other than for and million  respectively  in standby letters of credit used to support company workers compensation programs in and and to purchase fish meal from a third party in as of december   the company had million available under its working capital credit facility 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements other than normal operating leases and standby letters of credit

index to financial statements this amount represents the fish meal purchase not related to standby letters of credit 
an additional  of fish meal purchases is contained in standby letters of credit obligation 
the company expects to make contributions of million to the pension plan in as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under the million credit facility other than million in standby letters of credit 
in september the united states department of commerce fisheries finance program approved a million financing application approval letter made by the company 
as of december   the company had closed on the million loan 
net operating activities provided used cash of approximately and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in operating activities is primarily attributable to the change in activities relating to increased inventory and losses associated with hurricanes katrina and rita 
net investing activities used cash of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to any future capital expenditures related to the hurricanes  the company s investing activities consists mainly of capital expenditures for equipment purchases  replacements  vessel refurbishments  and fish oil refining processes 
in addition to any future capital expenditures related to the hurricanes  the company anticipates making approximately million in capital expenditures in  which will be used to refurbish vessels  plant assets and to repair certain equipment 
investing activities also includes the receipt of million from an insurance company relating to hurricanes katrina and rita for the year ending december  net financing activities provided used cash of million and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year included million used for payments of debt obligations which was offset by million in proceeds from title xi debt 
the year included million for payments of debt obligations offset by million in proceeds by the exercise of stock options 
on december  the company entered into a million revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na the credit facility 
borrowings under this facility may be used for working capital and capital expenditures 
the company is required to comply with certain financial covenants from and after the last day of any month in which the credit facility s availability is less than million on any date or the credit facility s availability averages less than million for any calendar month 
the credit facility was amended on october   to increase the amount of title xi loans that the company is permitted to borrow from million to million 
the credit facility was further amended on november   to among other things  extend the term of the credit facility from december  to october   decrease the maximum borrowing availability tied to the company s eligible inventory from million to million  add a covenant that the company may not generate a net loss for any two consecutive quarters  increase the fixed charge coverage ratio to be less than to  as measured on a quarterly basis using the consolidated results of the four fiscal quarter period ending with the applicable reporting period and reduce both the unused commitment fee and interest rates 
a commitment fee of basis points per annum is payable quarterly on the actual daily amount of the availability under the credit facility 
the applicable interest rate will be adjusted up or down prospectively on a quarterly basis from libor plus to libor plus or at the company s option  prime minus to prime plus  depending upon the fixed charge coverage ratio being greater than times to less than or equal to times  respectively 
the credit facility is collateralized by all of the company s trade receivables  inventory and equipment 
in addition  the credit facility does not allow for the payment of cash dividends or stock repurchases 
as of december   the company was out of compliance with the minimum net income covenant in the credit facility due to its reporting of net losses for two consecutive quarters third and fourth quarters of 
the company notified the lender of the covenant non compliance and received a waiver from the lender 

index to financial statements as of december   the company was out of compliance with the ratio of earnings to fixed charges covenant in the credit facility 
the company notified the lender of the covenant non compliance and received a waiver from the lender 
as of december   the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
at december  and  the company had outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility totaling approximately million and million  respectively  issued primarily in support of worker s compensation insurance programs in and and to purchase fish meal from a third party in in september  the united states department of commerce fisheries finance program the ffp approved the company s financing application in an amount not to exceed million the approval letter 
borrowings under the approval letter are to be used to finance and or refinance approximately of the actual depreciable cost of the company s future fishing vessel refurbishments and capital expenditures relating to shore side fishing assets  for a term not to exceed years from inception at interest rates determined by the us treasury 
final approval for all such future projects requires individual approval through the secretary of commerce  national oceanic and atmospheric administration  and national marine fisheries service national marine fisheries service 
borrowings under the ffp are required to be evidenced by secured agreements  undertakings  and other documents of whatsoever nature deemed by the national marine fisheries service s sole discretion  as necessary to accomplish the intent and purpose of the approval letter 
the company is required to comply with customary national marine fisheries service covenants as well as certain special covenants 
in december  the company submitted a million financing request against the million approval  and subsequently amended that request to include the entire million 
the company closed on the million ffp loan on october  on december   pursuant to the title xi program  the united states department of commerce approved another financing application made by the company in the amount of million 
the company expects to close on a portion of this application in the latter part of the company s principal raw material is menhaden  a species of fish that inhabits coastal and inland tidal waters in the united states 
menhaden are undesirable for direct human consumption due to their small size  prominent bones and high oil content 
certain state agencies  as well as interstate compacts  impose resource depletion restrictions on menhaden pursuant to fisheries management legislation or regulations and may impose additional legislation or regulations in the future 
for example  in august  the management board of the asmfc approved an addendum to an existing fishery management plan 
the addendum  if it were to be accepted and implemented by the commonwealth of virginia as an asmfc member  would establish an annual cap for a five year period beginning in on the company s menhaden landings from the chesapeake bay in an amount equal to the company s average annual landings over a five year period 
the company estimates that this annual limitation would be approximately  metric tons 
had the cap been in place for the fishing season  it would not have impacted the company s fishing operations in the chesapeake bay 
however  in this case  the virginia legislature did not approve the recommended cap  and the virginia attorney general later issued an advisory opinion that the management board exceeded its authority when it adopted the recommended cap 
see item and business and properties company overview regulation 
to date  the company has not experienced any material adverse impact on its fish catch or results of operations as a result of these recommended restrictions 
the company from time to time considers potential transactions including  but not limited to  enhancement of physical facilities to improve production capabilities and the acquisition of other businesses 
certain of the potential transactions reviewed by the company would  if completed  result in its entering new lines of business generally including certain businesses to which the company sells its products such as pet food manufacturers  aquaculture feed manufacturers  fertilizer companies and organic foods distributors  although historically  reviewed opportunities have been generally related in some manner to the company s existing operations or which would have added new protein products to the company s product lines 
although the company does not  as of the date hereof  have any commitment with respect to a material acquisition  it could enter into such agreement in the future 

index to financial statements the company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and jones act liability for employees aboard its vessels collectively  vessel claims insurance 
the typical vessel claims insurance policy contains an annual aggregate deductible aad for which the company remains responsible  while the insurance carrier is responsible for all applicable amounts which exceed the aad 
it is the company s policy to accrue current amounts due and record amounts paid out on each claim 
once payments exceed the aad  the company records an insurance receivable for a given policy year 
in  the company s vessel claims insurance carrier for the period october  through september   and for of the company s jones act claims for the period october  through march  was declared insolvent by a state insurance regulator 
the company had previously provided an allowance for doubtful accounts for all the amount due to the company from the insurance carrier 
the company believes that the existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funds available through its credit facility will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
in addition  the company expects to receive insurance proceeds from hurricane damages to assist in meeting its capital expenditures 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein  including estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant of these requiring difficult or complex judgments in any particular period involve the costing of inventory  including inventory lower of cost or market analyses and the company s accounting for various losses on self insurance retentions 
hurricane losses on august   the company s moss point  mississippi fish processing facility and adjacent shipyard were severely damaged by hurricane katrina 
on september   the company s cameron  louisiana and abbeville  louisiana fish processing facilities were also severely damaged by hurricane rita 
each of these facilities was non operational immediately after these weather events 
operations at the moss point fish processing facility  the abbeville fish processing facility and the shipyard were re established in mid october   but at reduced processing capabilities 
the company is currently rebuilding its cameron  louisiana facility and expects it to be fully operational by mid the direct impact of the two hurricanes upon the company was a loss of physical inventories and physical damage to the plants 
the interruption of processing capabilities caused the company to address the impact of abnormal downtime of its processing facilities  which resulted in the immediate recognition of costs which would ordinarily have been captured as inventory costs 
the amounts of these losses are more fully described in notes   and the company maintains insurance coverage for a variety of these damages  most notably property  inventory and vessel insurance 
the nature and extent of the insurance coverage varies by line of policy and the company has recorded insurance recoveries as accounts receivable based on estimates 
the company anticipates that further recoveries could be available  but such additional recoveries will require further analysis and discussions with the company s insurance carriers and adjusters 
such recoveries  if any  would be recognized in future periods once they are deemed probable 
the company does not maintain business interruption insurance in any material amounts 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue principally from the sales of a variety of protein and oil products derived from menhaden 
the company recognizes revenue for the sale of its products when title and rewards of ownership to its products are transferred to the customer 

index to financial statements impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates at each balance sheet date the continued appropriateness of the carrying value of its long lived assets including its long term receivables and property  plant and equipment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposals of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such assets or grouping of assets may not be recoverable 
the company has grouped certain assets together primarily marine vessels for impairment testing on a fleet basis 
if indicators of impairment are present  management would evaluate the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets or grouping of assets compared to the carrying amount of those items 
the net carrying value of assets or grouping of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
the company considers continued operating losses  or significant and long term changes in business conditions  to be its primary indicators of potential impairment 
property  equipment and depreciation property and equipment additions are recorded at cost 
depreciation of property and equipment is computed by the straight line method at rates expected to amortize the cost of property and equipment  net of salvage value  over their estimated useful lives 
estimated useful lives  determined at the date of acquisition  of new assets acquired are based primarily on the review of existing property and equipment 
estimated useful lives are as follow useful lives years fishing vessels and fish processing plants machinery  equipment  furniture and fixtures and other replacements and major improvements are capitalized  maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
upon sale or retirement  the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts 
any resulting gains or losses are included in the statement of operations 
the company capitalizes interest as part of the acquisition cost of a qualifying asset 
interest is capitalized only during the period of time required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use 
inventories inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company s fishing season runs from mid april to the first of november in the gulf of mexico and from the beginning of may into december in the atlantic 
government regulations generally preclude the company from fishing during the off seasons 
the company s inventory cost system considers all costs associated with an annual fish catch and its processing  both variable and fixed  including both costs incurred during the off season and during the fishing season 
the company s costing system allocates cost to inventory quantities on a per unit basis as calculated by a formula that considers total estimated inventoriable costs for a fishing season including off season costs to total estimated fish catch and the relative fair market value of the individual products produced 
the company adjusts the cost of sales  off season costs and inventory balances at the end of each quarter based on revised estimates of total inventoriable costs and fish catch 
the company s lower of cost or market value analyses at year end and at interim periods compares total estimated per unit production cost of the company s expected production to the projected per unit market prices of the products 
the impairment analyses involve estimates of  among other things  future fish catches and related costs  and expected commodity prices for the fish products 
these estimates  which management believes are reasonable and supportable  involve estimates of future activities and 
index to financial statements events which are inherently imprecise and from which actual results may differ materially 
revisions in such estimates or actual results could materially impact the company s results of operation and financial position 
any costs incurred during abnormal downtime related to activity at the company s plants are charged to expense as incurred 
during the off seasons  in connection with the upcoming fishing seasons  the company incurs costs ie  plant and vessel related labor  utilities  rent  repairs and depreciation that are directly related to the company s infrastructure 
these costs accumulate in inventory and are applied as elements of the cost of production of the company s products throughout the fishing season ratably based on the company s monthly fish catch and the expected total fish catch for the season 
insurance the company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and jones act liabilities for employees aboard its vessels 
the company provides reserves for those portions of the annual aggregate deductible for which the company remains responsible by using an estimation process that considers company specific and industry data as well as management s experience  assumptions and consultation with counsel  as these reserves include estimated settlement costs 
management s current estimated range of liabilities related to such cases is based on claims for which management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
for those claims where there may be a range of loss  the company has recorded an estimated liability inside that range  based on management s experience  assumptions and consultation with counsel 
the process of estimating and establishing reserves for these claims is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate net cost of a claim may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved 
there is some degree of inherent variability in assessing the ultimate amount of losses associated with these claims due to the extended period of time that transpires between when the claim might occur and the full settlement of such claims 
this variability is generally greater for jones act claims by vessel employees 
the company continually evaluates loss estimates associated with claims and losses as additional information becomes available and revises its estimates 
although management believes estimated reserves related to these claims are adequately recorded  it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from the recorded reserves  which could materially impact the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flow 
with respect to health insurance  the company is primarily self insured 
the company purchases individual stop loss coverage with a large deductible 
as a result  the company is primarily self insured for claims and associated costs up to the amount of the deductible  with claims in excess of the deductible amount being covered by insurance 
expected claims estimates are based on health care trend rates and historical claims data  actual claims may differ from those estimates 
the company continually evaluates its claims experience related to this coverage with information obtained from its risk management consultants 
assumptions used in preparing these insurance estimates are based on factors such as claims settlement patterns  claim development trends  claim frequency and severity patterns  inflationary trends and data reasonableness 
together these factors will generally affect the analysis and determination of the best estimate of the projected ultimate claim losses 
the results of these evaluations are used to both analyze and adjust the company s insurance loss reserves 
pension the company estimates income or expense related to its pension plan based on actuarial assumptions  including assumptions regarding discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
the company determines the discount rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of its pension obligations 
based on historical data and discussions with its actuary  omega determines its expected return on plan assets based on the expected long term rate of return 
index to financial statements on its plan assets and the market related value of its plan assets 
changes in these assumptions can result in significant changes in estimated pension income or expense 
the company will revise its assumptions on an annual basis based upon changes in current interest rates  return on plan assets and the underlying demographics of the workforce 
these assumptions are reasonably likely to change in future periods and may have a material impact on future earnings

the company generally has higher sales during the menhaden harvesting season which includes the second and third quarter of each year due to increased product availability  but prices during the fishing season tend to be lower than during the off season 
as a result  the company s quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future 
in addition  from time to time the company defers sales of inventory based on worldwide prices for competing products that affect prices for the company s products which may affect comparable period comparisons

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business  the financial condition of the company is exposed to minimal market risk associated with interest rate movements on the company s borrowings 
a one percent increase or decrease in the levels of interest rates on variable rate debt would not result in a material change to the company s results of operations 
although the company sells products in foreign countries  all of the company s revenues are billed and paid for in us dollars 
as a result  management does not believe that the company is exposed to any significant foreign country currency exchange risk  and the company does not utilize market risk sensitive instruments to manage its exposure to this risk
