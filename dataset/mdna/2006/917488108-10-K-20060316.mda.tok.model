item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts and where noted 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with accompanying financial statements 
productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
year end total assets were  compared to  in cash and investments of cash balances were  and  and of total assets  at year end and  respectively 
year end cash balances increased  even though utmd paid  in dividends   in share repurchases and  in litigation costs in  because of continuing excellent cash generated from operations before litigation costs of  and a  loan taken out by utmd s ireland subsidiary 
excluding cash and investment balances  average total asset turns in were  consistent with years prior to year end assets since were substantially higher than in prior years due to tyco patent infringement damages awarded to utmd 
in  total assets excluding cash balances will continue to be less than annual sales 
improvement in total asset turns will depend on reduction of excess cash and investment balances 
property  plant and equipment pp e assets are comprised of utah  oregon and ireland manufacturing molds  production tooling and equipment  test equipment  computer communications equipment and software  and the utah and ireland facilities 
utmd leases the oregon facility as part of the cmi acquisition  and a portion of its midvale  utah parking lot 
in  net pp e declined because depreciation of exceeded new purchases of  while ireland assets decreased in dollar value as a result of a weaker us dollar usd 
the lower consolidated pp e balances combined with higher sales resulted in substantially higher pp e turns 
the current book value of consolidated pp e is of acquisition cost 
management believes that pp e is in good working order and capable of supporting increased sales activity 
in  depreciation of fixed assets is expected to again exceed new pp e purchases required to sustain current operations 
combining this with expected higher sales suggests that pp e asset turns will again improve in  unless offset by a strengthening of the euro relative to the usd  inflating the dollar value of ireland pp e 
average inventory turns in increased to from in  despite a increase in ending inventories  primarily as a result of the increase in sales activity 
management has set this level of turns for its objective in net after allowance for doubtful accounts year end accounts receivable a r balances decreased at the same time that sales activity increased  yielding lower average days in a r on december  of days  based on q shipment activity 
this was well within management s continuing objective of days 
a r over days from invoice date of about of total a r at year end were about the same as at the end of the prior year 
the company believes the older a r are collectible or within its reserve balances for uncollectible accounts 
working capital at year end was  compared to  at year end both of these amounts substantially exceed working capital needs for normal operations 
utmd s current ratio increased to from  due to a substantial decrease in utmd s litigation reserve part of accrued expenses reflecting the dismissal and conclusion of the fda lawsuit filed in august  as well as a substantial decrease in income tax payable resulting from the one time tax holiday from the american jobs creation act of since the large majority of the working capital balance is excess cash and cash investments  the current ratio going forward in will depend primarily upon the timing and extent of use of existing cash and investment balances 
the other current asset and current liability components of working capital are expected to remain consistent with and within management targets  given an increase in sales 
intangible assets  which are comprised of goodwill resulting from acquisitions and the costs of obtaining patents and other technology rights  were  at the end of compared to  sat the end of the goodwill balance of  reduced from time of acquisition  is the result of three acquisitions in  and which were made in cash at conservative valuations 
the reduction was goodwill amortization as a result of utmd using previous gaap through for the purchase method of acquisition accounting 
under current gaap  goodwill will not be expensed unless and until the market value of the acquired entity becomes impaired 
the three acquisitions continue to be viable parts of utmd s overall business activities  representing of total sales in utmd does not expect the goodwill value of the acquisitions to become impaired in other intangible assets decreased in as a result of amortization 
total net intangible assets at the end of represented of total assets 
liabilities 
although utmd s current liabilities decreased from the end of to the end of by  total liabilities increased  yielding a ending total debt ratio of  up from at the end of current liabilities declined primarily because the ending litigation reserve accrued liabilities was  lower 
however  the long term note payable initiated in ireland in december  which had a balance of  at the end of  more than offset the reductions in other liabilities 
the purpose of the note payable was to finance the repatriation of profits achieved in ireland since  under the american jobs creation act of utmd ltd 
plans to repay this note from profits generated over the next five years 
deferred income taxes declined in due mainly to reversing previously accrued deferred income taxes for undistributed earnings from utmd s foreign subsidiary 
results of operations 
a revenues 
global consolidated sales increased in compared to foreign international sales increased 
us domestic sales increased 
sales increased despite customers being negatively affected by the august  fda press release that announced that the fda had filed a lawsuit against utmd alleging lack of compliance with the quality system regulation qsr 
in october  a federal court ruled that utmd has been and is complying with the qsr  and dismissed the fda allegations in entirety 
the fda did not appeal 
international revenues also continued to be negatively affected in because of the fda s refusal from early until late november to provide certificates to foreign governments cfgs  certifying utmd s compliance with the qsr for the benefit of countries outside the us which depend on the fda s regulatory lead 
utmd divides its domestic sales into two primary distribution channels direct sales which are sales to end user customers by utmd s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales reps  specialty distributors and national hospital distribution companies  and oem sales which are component sales to other companies where products are packaged and resold as part of another company s finished product offerings 
as a percentage of total domestic sales  direct sales were of domestic sales in  and in both and the remaining sales were oem sales  eg of domestic sales in were domestic oem sales 
domestic direct sales represented of global consolidated sales in both and  compared to in domestic direct sales which appeared least affected by the fda announcement were sales where clinicians make the purchase decision 
consequently  the least affected sales were sales to physician offices and clinics 
hospital labor and delivery l d department sales where administrators determine what products are purchased appeared to be the most affected 
hospital nicu sales were less affected than l d because clinical practitioners still have major discretion in determining what products are purchased 
in order to help offset hospital administrators concern over the august  fda press release  utmd employed a special loyalty discount which lasted for about three months in late 
the amount of the discount which affected only sales was international sales in were of global consolidated sales compared to and in years and  respectively 
of the international sales  were for customers in europe  compared to in and in ireland operations utmd ltd 
shipped of international sales in usd terms in  compared to in and in utmd ltd 
shipments  including intercompany sales to midvale  were up in euro terms and up in usd terms compared to utmd groups sales into four product line categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician and patient safety  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical uterine disease including letz  endometrial sampling  diagnostic laparoscopy  and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal care  comprised of devices that provide developmentally friendly care to the most critically ill babies including providing vascular access  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  providing protection and assisting in specialized qpplications  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized components as well as molded parts sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors often enjoy a dominant market share and typically have differentiated product features protected by patents 
global revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
international revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
as a brief explanation of revenues in the above tables of the  decline in total obstetrics sales in  was from lower sales of vacuum assisted delivery systems vads  a decline  and from lower intran plus iupc sales  an decline 
the lower iupc and vads sales resulted primarily from concerns of hospital administrators related to the fda press release of august  other contributing factors included a trend in obstetrics practice that favors abdominal operative deliveries over vaginal operative deliveries because of medical malpractice litigation risk  and increased competition including effects of product bundling agreements 
cheaper priced  less clinically effective products represent significant competition where hospital administrators are constrained by gpo contracts or may not take the total cost of care into consideration  including increased risk of complications and utilization rates 
gynecology electrosurgery urology product sales which had been negatively affected by the fda refusal to provide cfgs for foreign customers  and the fda press release which caused concern among domestic customers  rebounded in consolidated global neonatal product sales increased in the closing and move to mexico of the san antonio manufacturing operations of utmd s competitor  neocare  a subsidiary of arrow international  was a positive factor for utmd s neonatal product sales 
international blood pressure monitoring and accessories bpm sales increased  but domestic bpm sales decreased 
domestic bpm sales were negatively affected by the august fda press release 
looking forward to  utmd s improvement in sales depends on utmd s continued recapture of lost sales due to the unnecessary concern caused by the august  fda press release  continued expansion in clinical acceptance of newer specialty products  release of new products after fda concurrence with premarketing submissions and continued development of utmd s international distribution channels 
management targets a revenue increase again in  relative to the prior year 
b gross profit 
utmd s average gross profit margin gpm  the surplus after costs of manufacturing  inspecting  packaging  sterilizing and shipping products cgs are subtracted from net revenues  was  the same as in the gpm in was a company record 
in  utmd experienced higher materials costs  particularly for plastics  along with increased labor costs  including particularly costs of medical care coverage for employees 
the company continues to maintain facilities and other manufacturing overheads far in excess of its needs 
as a result  it projects that the dilution of fixed overhead costs that will occur with increased sales in will offset the continuing increase in incremental direct material and labor costs  together with some competitive pressure on prices  yielding a gpm in comparable to oem sales are sales of utmd components that are marketed by other companies as part of their product offerings 
utmd utilizes oem sales as a means to help maximize utilization of its capabilities established to satisfy its direct sales business 
as a general rule  prices for oem sales expressed as a multiple of direct variable manufacturing expenses are lower than for direct sales because  in the oem and international channels  utmd s business partners incur significant expenses of sales and marketing 
because of utmd s small size and period to period fluctuations in oem business activity  allocations of fixed manufacturing overheads cannot be meaningfully allocated between direct and oem sales 
therefore  utmd does not report gpm by sales channels 
c operating profit 
operating profit  or income from operations  is the surplus after operating expenses are subtracted from gross profits 
in and  operating profit includes other operating income resulting from utmd s patent infringement victory over tyco  net of associated expenses 
that added income resulted in a net contribution to income from operating income expense in those two years  an unusual result 
operating expenses include sales and marketing s m expenses  research and development r d expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
combined operating expenses were  in  compared to  in and  in litigation expenses are included as part of g a expenses 
substantial litigation expenses associated with the dispute with the fda are included  and g a expenses 
in order to help clarify operating expenses  we provide the table below r d expenses s m expenses g a fda litigation expenses g a all other expenses g a expenses total total operating expenses utmd s operating profit margin operating profits divided by total sales was in  compared to in and in  which does not correlate to sales since there were substantial expenses and or other income in all three periods unrelated to sales 
excluding the other operating income related to patent infringement damages and fda litigation expenses  operating profits would have been   and  and operating profit margins would have been  and in  and  respectively  which management believes is a better measure of operating profits relative to sales activity 
looking forward to  utmd expects to control operating expenses  excluding consideration for any remaining required fda litigation expenses  at a level below of sales  yielding a operating profit margin about 
i s m expenses s m expenses are the costs of communicating utmd s differences and product advantages  providing training and other customer service in support of the use of utmd s solutions  processing orders and funding gpo fees 
because utmd sells internationally through third party distributors  its s m expenses are predominantly employed for us business activity where it sells directly to clinical users 
the largest component of s m expenses is the cost of directly employing representatives that provide coverage across the us as a percent of total sales  s m operating expenses were in  in and in in  utmd intends to substantially expand its direct sales force  but intends to manage s m expenses to less than of total sales 
ii r d expenses r d expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs  developing innovative concepts  testing concepts for viability  validating methods of manufacture  completing regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control  responding to customer requests for product enhancements  and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes 
as a percent of sales  r d expenses were compared to in both and in addition to new products still being developed  a number of existing products were enhanced or updated in in  utmd plans to increase r d spending modestly as a percentage of sales in order to reinvigorate its product development pipeline 
iii g a expenses g a expenses include the front office functional costs of executive management  finance and accounting  corporate information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  risk management  protection of intellectual property  and legal costs 
in addition to employing the personnel required to coordinate or manage those functions  g a expenses include outside director costs  outside legal counsel and litigation experts  independent accounting audit fees  k administration  nasdaq exchange fees  write offs of uncollectible receivables  business insurance costs and corporate contributions to charitable organizations 
aggregate g a expenses as a percent of sales were in  in and in g a expenses excluding the fda litigation expenses were  and of sales in  and  respectively  which management believes is a better indicator of g a expenses related to sales 
excluding any remaining required fda litigation expenses  utmd plans to hold g a expenses at a level about of sales 
iv other operating income other operating income in both and resulted from utmd s patent infringement victory over tyco 
in january  the company received a payment of  in damages and interest resulting from a district federal court judgment  and a post judgment settlement 
the company recognized operating income from that payment of  in first quarter and  in fourth quarter expenses related to the judgment of reduced the net other operating income recognized in d non operating income  non operating expense and ebt 
non operating income  or other income  includes royalties from licensing utmd s technology to other companies  rent from leasing underutilized property to others  income earned from investing the company s excess cash and gains or losses from the sale of assets  offset by non operating expenses which include interest expenses and bank fees 
in prior sec form ks  utmd reported the tyco patent infringement damages as part of non operating income  instead as part of operating income expense 
after the change in allocating tyco patent infringement damages to operating expenses  non operating income was in  in and in in and  the increases in investment income resulted from higher average cash and investment balances during the applicable years 
royalties received were in all three years 
future royalties may vary depending on the success of other companies in selling products licensed by utmd  and the remaining life of the applicable patents 
in  utmd paid for interest expense after it borrowed million  in december to facilitate the repatriation of profits generated by its ireland operations since in and  interest expense was and  respectively 
utmd expects interest expense of about in  as a result of the ireland note payable 
however  management still expects non operating income after subtracting the interest expense to be about the same as in because of projected higher investment balances and higher interest rates in the us the actual amount of non operating income may be lower if utmd utilizes its excess cash for an acquisition  continued litigation with the fda seeking to recover damages or substantial share repurchases 
non operating income may be higher if investment balances are higher because the fda or a federal court honors utmd s claims for damages 
earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding utmd s non operating income to its operating profits 
ebt margin is ebt divided by sales 
utmd s ebt margin was  and in  and  respectively 
excluding the tyco and fda items in the table above  utmd s ebt margin would have been  and of sales in  and  respectively  which management believes is a better indicator of past ebt related to sales 
given the projections previously noted  management is targeting ebt of about  or an ebt margin of of sales 
e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes  often called the bottom line 
net income was   and  in  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was  and respectively 
the significantly lower income tax provision in was a result of the american jobs creation act of the act enacted in october which allows a temporary tax deduction on repatriated foreign earnings  which must be accomplished in utmd previously included a deferred tax liability in reported results  anticipating that profits generated by its ireland facility would eventually be repatriated  triggering additional us income taxes 
also  utmd recorded a favorable deferred tax liability adjustment after the conclusion of a formal irs audit in q these were non recurring tax benefits limited to the year other year to year fluctuations in the tax rate have resulted from differences in distribution of state income taxes  variations in profits of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on exported manufactured products  extraterritorial income exclusions  higher marginal tax rates for ebt above million  and other factors such as r d tax credits 
management expects that utmd s consolidated income tax rate will be around  but this is difficult to predict 
utmd s net income expressed as a percentage of sales was  and for years  and  respectively 
excluding the tyco and fda items identified in the table in operating expenses  utmd s bottom line was   and  or  and of sales  in  and  respectively 
utmd s profitability has consistently ranked in the top performance tier of all us publicly traded companies  and has been a primary driver for utmd s past excellent returns on shareholders equity roe 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take into consideration stock option awards which are in the money  ie  have exercise prices below the current period s weighted average market value 
diluted eps were  and in  and  respectively 
excluding the tyco and fda items  eps would have been  and in  and  respectively 
utmd s eps has grown at a compounded rate of per year since the end of weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  in thousands compared to  shares in and  shares in dilution for in the money unexercised options for the year was in thousands shares compared to in and in the total number of options outstanding at year end declined from year end  following no decline in the prior year 
dilution decreased in from because the average number of options outstanding decreased substantially  even though a higher average share price in the stock market increased the dilution effect of each option 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd after payment of dividends to internally finance its growth  divided by the average accumulated shareholders equity during the applicable time period 
roe includes balance sheet measures as well as income statement measures 
roe in was before dividends 
roe was negatively affected by fda litigation costs  but enhanced by share repurchases which were helped because of a lower share price than probably would have existed without the fda lawsuit 
roe in and  which was aided by tyco patent infringement damages  was before dividends and  respectively 
utmd s roe before dividends has averaged per year over the last years 
this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without adding external financing that would dilute shareholder interests 
for example  a roe will financially support annual growth in revenues without issuing more stock 
the lower roe in  despite a continued excellent net profit margin  was due to payment of dividends to shareholders which reduced retained profits  much higher average cash and investment balances which reduced total asset turns  and a low debt ratio 
looking forward  unless utmd utilizes its cash to make an acquisition or repurchase shares  roe will be lower than even though net profits are projected to increase  because average shareholders equity will increase faster on a percentage basis than net profits 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital and the tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee incentive stock options  totaled  in compared to  in and  in the major changes in operating assets and liabilities in both and were related to the accrual and receipt of about million from tyco international for patent infringement  and taxes on that income 
cash provided by operating activities in includes continued excellent net income performance  aided by a tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee options  compared to in and  in the company s use of cash for investing activities was primarily as a result of purchases of liquid investments  in an effort to maximize returns on excess cash balances while maintaining liquidity 
utmd expended  in on such purchases  compared to  in and in in  utmd received  from selling short term investments  compared to  in and in no acquisitions were made in or utmd invested  in second quarter to acquire abcorp  inc  its vendor for fetal monitoring belts 
please see the table under supplemental disclosure of cash flow information for more detail of the abcorp assets purchased 
in  utmd received and issued  shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options 
employees and directors exercised a total of  option shares in  with  shares immediately being retired as a result of the individuals trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options and related tax withholding 
utmd paid in to meet tax withholding requirements on options exercised 
utmd repurchased  shares of stock in the open market at a cost of  during option exercises in were at an average price of per share 
share repurchases in the open market were at an average cost of per share  including commissions and fees 
in  the company received  from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee and director stock options  including  shares retired upon employees trading those shares in payment of the stock option exercise price 
in december  utmd s foreign subsidiary borrowed million  to finance repatriation from ireland to the us of profits achieved since under the american jobs creation act of utmd did not borrow during in  utmd made repayments of  on its note payable  which eliminated the line of credit balance remaining at the end of  while receiving in proceeds from the line of credit 
the previous loan was undertaken to finance repurchase of shares 
although utmd has not borrowed under its revolving line of credit since it paid off the balance in  the line of credit is used to guarantee the current ireland loan in order to achieve the most favorable credit terms 
management believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance internal growth plans 
planned capital expenditures are expected to be approximately to keep facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order 
in addition  utmd may use cash in for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings  for continued share repurchases if the price of the stock remains undervalued  and if available for a reasonable price  acquisitions that may strategically fit utmd s business and are accretive to performance 
the revolving line of credit will continue to be available for liquidity when the timing of acquisitions or repurchases of stock require a large amount of cash in a short period of time not otherwise available from existing cash and investment balances 
in summary  management plans to utilize cash not needed to support normal operations in one or a combination of the following to make investments in new technology  to acquire a product line that will augment revenue growth and better utilize utmd s infrastructure  and or to repurchase utmd shares in the open marketplace 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following is a summary of utmd s significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  contractual obligations and commitments total and thereafter long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total additional information regarding the company s contractual obligations and commitments may be found in notes and of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
management has identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies which require significant judgment and estimates 
although management believes its estimates are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the majority of the company s receivables are with hospitals and medical device distributors 
although the company has historically not had significant write offs of bad debt  the possibility exists  particularly with foreign customers where collection efforts can be difficult or in the event of widespread us hospital bankruptcies 
inventory valuation reserves the company strives to maintain a good balance of inventory to meets its customer s needs while not tying up an unnecessary amount of the company s resources increasing the possibility of  among other things  obsolescence 
the company believes its method of reviewing actual and projected demand for its existing inventory allows it to arrive at a fair inventory valuation reserve 
while the company has historically not had significant inventory write offs  the possibility exists that one or more of its products may become unexpectedly obsolete for which a reserve has not previously been created 
the company s historical write offs have not been materially different from its estimates 
management s outlook 
in summary  in utmd plans to increase efforts to regain business lost as a result of the fda s august  press release  reinvigorate internal new product development  continue outstanding operating performance  look for new acquisitions to augment sales growth  and utilize current cash balances in shareholders best long term interest 
item of this report describes the legal proceedings regarding utmd s dispute with the fda 
the us court determined that utmd has been and is in compliance with the provisions of the quality system regulation 
the company remains proud of its long term record of compliance with all government regulations 
the reliability and performance of utmd s products is high and represents significant clinical benefits while providing minimum total cost of care 
physicians do care about the well being of their patients  but their time is limited to evaluate choices  and they have hospital administrators to deal with who often look at the initial price of a product without understanding the total cost of care which includes risk of unwanted complications and unnecessary utilization 
in the us  utmd will continue to leverage its reputation as an innovator which will responsively take on challenges to work with physicians who use its products in specialty hospital areas  or outside the hospital in their office practices 
internationally  where utmd must depend on the knowledge  focus  relationships and energy of independent distributors  management will continue to closely monitor performance and recruit needed business partners 
utmd will continue to focus on differentiating itself  especially from commodity oriented competitors 
utmd is small  but its employees are experienced and diligent in their work 
our passion is in providing innovative clinical solutions that will help reduce health risks for women and their babies 
the company has a defined focus and does not seek revenue growth as its primary motivation 
we fundamentally seek to do an excellent job in meeting our customers and their patients needs  and provide our shareholders with excellent returns 
looking back five years from the end of to the end of  utmd s eps have more than doubled  and its year ending share price has more than quadrupled up 
in comparison  the nasdaq composite  s p index and djia indices were all down  and down  respectively  over that same five year time span 
in  utmd again demonstrated a high positive cash flow  managing working capital effectively and keeping new capital expenditures below its rate of depreciation of existing assets 
utmd s balance sheet is strong enough to finance an acquisition in without issuing stock 
in considering acquisitions  utmd looks to acquire successful companies that will enhance its specialist focus 
when utmd acquires a company  it probably will be for cash and with the idea that it will be able to retain key resources that helped make the acquired entity successful 
accounting policy changes 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this revised statement establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services  including the grant of stock options to employees and directors 
the statement is effective for periods beginning after december   and will require the company to recognize compensation cost based on the grant date fair value of the equity instruments it awards 
the company currently accounts for those instruments under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion  including the disclosure only provisions of the original sfas accordingly  no compensation cost from issuing equity instruments has been recognized in the company s financial statements 
the company estimates that the required adoption of sfas r in first quarter will have a negative impact on its consolidated financial statements 
please see note  starting on page f for an estimate of the impact this statement would have had on the company s net income for the periods covered by this report 
the company estimates that adoption of this statement will result in about additional compensation expense during the year related to options outstanding on the date of this report 
the company intends to continue granting stock options or other equity instruments  although at a lower level than in the past  which will increase the amount of stock based compensation in and beyond 
the board of director s action on may  to accelerate the vesting of under water options reduced the financial statement impact of this accounting policy change 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had manufacturing operations  including related assets  in ireland denominated in the euro  and sold products under agreements denominated in various western european currencies 
the euro and other currencies have been and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond the control of utmd 
the exchange rate for the euro was  
and 
per us dollar as of december   and  respectively 
please see note in item   below under translation of foreign currencies for more information 
utmd manages its foreign currency risk without separate hedging transactions by converting currencies as transactions occur
