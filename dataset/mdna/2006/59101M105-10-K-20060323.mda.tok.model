this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel drugs to address some of the world s most widespread and costly chronic diseases involving pathways in the liver 
these diseases include metabolic diseases such as diabetes  hyperlipidemia  a disease involving elevated levels of lipids such as cholesterol  and obesity  among others  and liver diseases such as hepatitis and primary liver cancer 
we have established a broad and growing product pipeline targeting large markets with significant unmet medical needs 
we have discovered all of our product candidates internally using our proprietary technologies 
we currently have four product candidates in clinical trials  pradefovir  cs  mb and mb pradefovir and mb are being developed for the treatment of hepatitis b and primary liver cancer  respectively 
cs and mb both work by the same mechanism and both are being developed for the treatment of type diabetes 
we have incurred annual net losses since inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we continue to develop current and future clinical development candidates  commercialize our product candidates  if any  that receive regulatory approval  continue and expand our research and development programs  and acquire or in license products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our own 
we have a limited history of operations and  to date  we have not generated any product revenues 
in addition to our initial public offering in june and our private placement of common stock and warrants in october  we have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements of preferred stock as well as direct payments of sponsored research funding  license fees  milestone payments and equity investments from our collaborative partners 
we have received additional funding through equipment financing arrangements and small business innovation research  or sbir  grants 
our agreements with collaborators may include joint marketing or promotion arrangements of our products or products licensed from our collaborators 
for example  we have retained co promotion rights for cs in north america with daiichi sankyo 
alternatively  we may grant exclusive marketing rights to our collaborators in exchange for up front fees  milestones and royalties on future sales  if any 
we have licensed worldwide commercialization rights for pradefovir to valeant 
we have retained rights to mb  mb  mb and all of the compounds generated from our current research programs  with the exception of product candidates covered by our collaborations with merck 
we intend to eventually market one or more of the product candidates for which we retain commercialization rights through our own sales force or with a co promotion partner in the us and through strategic collaborations abroad 
we will rely on our partners or third party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of these products for pre clinical and clinical studies and large scale commercialization upon their approval 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our ongoing clinical trials and the regulatory review and approval process  the results of our research and development efforts  reliance on third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates  competition from other products and uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patent rights 
research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  costs associated with pre clinical development and clinical trials of our product candidates  facility costs  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and related contract research and depreciation 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on the clinical development of mb  mb and the potential further advanced pre clinical development and potential clinical trials of mb in addition  research and development activities include work on lead compounds in our other research programs 
in february  we began a phase i clinical trial of mb we plan to file an ind for mb and to commence clinical trials of mb in if the pre clinical data is supportive and the proposed clinical trials are cleared by the fda 
we are responsible for all costs incurred in our research programs with the exception of the ampk program partnered with merck 
under the terms of our collaboration agreements with merck  we had received approximately million in research funding through december  valeant and daiichi sankyo are responsible for the costs of clinical development of pradefovir and cs  respectively 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates and lead compounds from our research programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
due to these same factors  we are unable to determine the anticipated completion dates for our current research and development projects 
however  we expect our research and development costs to be substantial and to increase as we continue the development of our current product candidates  as well as continue and expand our research programs 
generally  phase i clinical trials can be expected to last from to months  phase ii clinical trials can be expected to last from to months and phase iii clinical trials can be expected to last from to months 
however  clinical development timelines vary widely  as do the likelihood of success and total costs of clinical trials 
although we are currently focused primarily on advancing mb and mb through clinical development and mb into clinical development  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment of its market potential 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals for our product candidates  and the compliance with applicable regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material unfavorable effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be certain when or if any net cash inflow due to sales of any of our current product candidates will commence 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  investor relations and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
we anticipate continued increases in general and administrative expenses for investor relations and other activities associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
these increases will also likely include the hiring of additional personnel 
other income  net other income  net includes interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale  net of interest expense 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our audited financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our agreements generally contain multiple elements  including downstream milestones and royalties 
all fees are nonrefundable 
revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  provided that the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and collaborator funding  if any  of our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue at a level comparable to before the milestone achievement 
if both of these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining minimum period of our performance obligations under the agreement 
upfront  nonrefundable fees under our collaborations are recognized over the period the related services are provided 
nonrefundable upfront fees not associated with our future performance are recognized when received 
amounts received for research funding are recognized as revenues as the services are performed 
amounts received for research funding for a specific number of full time researchers are recognized as revenue as the services are provided  as long as the amounts received are not refundable regardless of the results of the research project 
clinical trial expenses 
our clinical trials are often conducted under contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee or unit price 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the actual level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
other incidental costs related to patient enrollment are accrued when known 
if contracted amounts are modified based upon changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed  we modify our accruals accordingly on a prospective basis 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement is a revision to sfas no 
and supersedes apb and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
this statement requires a public entity to expense the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments 
this statement also provides guidance on valuing and expensing these awards  as well as disclosure requirements of these equity arrangements 
this statement is effective for us in the first quarter of sfas no 
r permits public companies to choose between the following two adoption methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date  or a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas no 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  valuation of employee stock options under sfas no 
r is similar to sfas no 
 with minor exceptions 
the impact on our results of operations and earnings per share had we adopted sfas no 
is described in note to our audited financial statements accompanying this annual report on form k 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
in march  the eitf reached a final consensus on issue no 
 the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
eitf issue no 
requires that when the fair value of an investment security is less than its carrying value  an impairment exists for which the determination must be made as to whether the impairment is other than temporary 
the eitf issue no 
impairment model applies to all investment securities accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and to investment securities accounted for under the cost method to the extent an impairment indicator exists 
under the guidance  the determination of whether an impairment is other than temporary and therefore would result in a recognized loss depends on market conditions and management s intent and ability to hold the securities with unrealized losses 
in september  the fasb approved fasb staff position fsp eitf  which defers the effective date for recognition and measurement guidance contained in eitf issue no 
until certain issues are resolved 
in november  the fasb issued fsp fas fsp fas replaces the impairment evaluation guidance of eitf issue no 
with references to the existing other than temporary impairment guidance 
eitf s disclosure requirements remain in effect 
the fsp also supersedes eitf topic no 
d  recognition of other than temporary impairment upon the planned sale of a security whose cost exceeds fair value  and clarifies that an investor should recognize an impairment loss no later than when the impairment is deemed other than temporary  even if a decision to sell an impaired security has not been made 
the guidance in this fsp will be applied in the first quarter of we not expect the adoption of eitf issue no 
or fsp fas to have a material effect on our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenues 
revenues were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million decrease was mainly due to a decline in milestone revenue of approximately million which was attributable primarily to a million payment earned in the prior year period under our collaboration agreement with daiichi sankyo 
this decrease was partially offset by an additional collaboration agreement entered into with merck in june which included sponsored research revenue of million and payments earned under license revenue of million 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase was mainly due to increased spending of million in payroll and related benefits as a result of a higher average number of employees in  a million increase in pre clinical development expense for mb  increased research and development services expense of million  increased occupancy costs related to our new facility of million and increased travel  supplies and insurance expense of million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase reflected mainly an increase in professional services expense of million  higher payroll and related benefits costs of million as a result of a higher average number of employees in  an increase in corporate promotion expense of million  and increased travel  occupancy and public company costs of million 
amortization of employee stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and directors  we recorded amortization of deferred stock based compensation of approximately and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million of deferred stock based compensation 
prior to the adoption of sfas r in  deferred compensation is presented as a separate component of stockholders equity 
in  our board of directors authorized a transaction  effective june   calling for three of our executive officers to agree to tender  shares of their previously vested common stock and subject them to a new monthly vesting schedule over a four year period commencing on june  this transaction was entered into as repayment for outstanding principal and accrued interest on loans we made to those executive officers in connection with their purchase of our common stock in june we recorded  of deferred compensation at june   to be amortized over the four year vesting period of the underlying common stock 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
prior to the adoption of sfas r in  deferred compensation is presented as a separate component of stockholders equity 
other income  net 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to net interest income of million for the year ended december  the million net increase was mainly due to higher levels of invested cash in resulting from the proceeds of our private placement in october as well as higher investment yields 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenues were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million decrease was mainly due to a decline in license fee revenue of approximately million which was attributable to a one time payment associated with an exclusive option agreement with daiichi sankyo that expired in this decrease was partially offset by higher milestone revenue in  which included million earned under our collaboration agreement with daiichi sankyo 
additionally  we realized a million increase in sponsored research resulting from the initiation in of the research portion of our collaboration agreement with merck 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase was mainly due to increased spending of in payroll and related benefits as a result of a higher average number of employees in  a million increase in pre clinical development expense for mb and a million increase in clinical trials expenses related to mb general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the million increase reflected mainly an increase in professional services expense of million and higher payroll and related benefits costs of million as a result of a higher average number of employees in amortization of employee stock based compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and directors  we recorded amortization of deferred stock based compensation of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had approximately million of deferred stock based compensation 
other income  net 
net interest income was  for the year ended december   compared to net interest expense of  for the year ended december  the  net increase was mainly due to higher invested cash resulting from the proceeds of our initial public offering in june liquidity and capital resources in october  we raised approximately million in a private placement of common stock and the concurrent issuance of warrants for the purchase of common stock 
placement agent fees and other offering expenses were approximately million 
under the terms of the financing  we sold million shares of common stock at per share  the closing bid price for our common stock immediately preceding the entering into of the binding agreement for the transaction 
we also issued warrants to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
at the closing  investors in the financing paid an additional purchase price equal to per each share issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
on june   we completed an initial closing of our initial public offering in which we sold million shares of common stock for proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
in addition  on july   we completed an additional closing of our initial public offering in which we sold an additional  shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of an over allotment option which resulted in proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions 
as of december   we have financed through leases and loans the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements totaling approximately million  of which million was outstanding at that date 
the loans are collateralized with the purchased equipment  bear interest at rates ranging from approximately to  and are due in monthly installments through october additionally  we have received cumulative sbir grant funding of approximately million through december  as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale as compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
the increase mainly reflected net proceeds of million raised from our private placement in october and a million non refundable license payment under our ampk collaboration with merck which was offset by net cash used in operations of million and net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  resulting from net purchases of investments of million and million of equipment purchases 
the following summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year to years to years after years operating leases capital leases equipment financing total we also enter into agreements with clinical sites and contract research organizations for the conduct of our clinical trials 
we will make payments to these sites and organizations based upon the number of patients enrolled and the length of their participation in the clinical trials 
at this time  due to the variability associated with these agreements  we are unable to estimate with certainty the future patient enrollment costs we will incur 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors may include but are not limited to the following the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  prioritization and number of clinical development and research programs we pursue  the costs of expanding our operations  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the costs of establishing or contracting for manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the extent to which we acquire or in license new products  technologies or businesses 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through at least the next twelve months 
until we can generate significant continuing revenues  we expect to continue to satisfy our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through government grants and interest earned on cash balances 
for example  we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec which allows us to issue shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock for an aggregate initial offering price of up to million 
we may sell any of these securities from time to time in one or more offerings in amounts  at prices and on terms that we will determine at the time of the offering 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders ownership will be diluted 
any debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations 
these restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing  specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem our stock or make investments 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish potentially valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
we cannot be sure that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investment resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
related party transactions for a description of our related party transactions  see item of part iii of this form k  certain relationships and related transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
our long term capital lease obligations bears interest at fixed rates and therefore we do not have significant market risk exposure with respect to these obligations
