introduction landstar system  inc and its subsidiary  landstar system holdings  inc 
together  referred to herein as landstar or the company  provide transportation services to a variety of market niches throughout the united states and to a lesser extent in canada  and between the united states and canada  mexico and other countries through its operating subsidiaries 
landstar s business strategy is to be a non asset based provider of transportation capacity and logistics services delivering safe  specialized transportation services globally utilizing a network of independent commission sales agents and third party capacity providers 
landstar focuses on providing transportation services which emphasize customer service and information coordination among its independent commission sales agents  customers and capacity providers 
the company markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents and utilizes exclusively third party capacity providers to transport customers freight 
the nature of the company s business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue 
the company has three reportable business segments 
these are the carrier  global logistics formerly multimodal and insurance segments 
the carrier segment consists of landstar ranger  inc  landstar inway  inc  landstar ligon  inc  landstar gemini  inc 
and landstar carrier services  inc the carrier segment primarily provides transportation services to the truckload market for a wide range of general commodities over irregular or non repetitive routes utilizing dry and specialty vans and unsided trailers  including flatbed  drop deck and specialty 
it also provides short to long haul movement of containers by truck  dedicated power only truck capacity and truck brokerage 
the carrier segment markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents and utilizes independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the company under exclusive lease arrangements the business capacity owner independent contractors or bco independent contractors and other third party truck capacity providers under non exclusive contractual arrangements truck brokerage carriers 
the global logistics segment is comprised of landstar global logistics  inc and its subsidiaries  landstar logistics  inc and landstar express america  inc transportation and logistics services provided by the global logistics segment include the arrangement of multimodal ground  air  ocean and rail moves  contract logistics  truck brokerage  emergency and expedited ground  air and ocean freight and buses 
the global logistics segment markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents and utilizes capacity provided by bco independent contractors and other third party capacity providers  including truck brokerage carriers  railroads  air and ocean cargo carriers and bus providers 
the insurance segment is comprised of signature insurance company signature  a wholly owned offshore insurance subsidiary  and risk management claim services  inc the insurance segment provides risk and claims management services to landstar s operating subsidiaries 
in addition  it reinsures certain risks of the company s bco independent contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to landstar s operating subsidiaries 
during the fiscal year ended december   the carrier segment contributed of landstar s consolidated revenue  the global logistics segment contributed of landstar s consolidated revenue and the insurance segment contributed of landstar s consolidated revenue 
changes in financial condition and results of operations management believes the company s success principally depends on its ability to generate freight through its network of independent commission sales agents and to efficiently deliver that freight utilizing third party capacity providers 
management believes the most significant factors to the company s success include increasing revenue  sourcing capacity and controlling costs 

table of contents while customer demand  which is subject to overall economic conditions  ultimately drives increases or decreases in revenue  the company primarily relies on its independent commission sales agents to establish customer relationships and generate revenue opportunities 
management s primary focus with respect to revenue growth is on revenue generated by independent commission sales agents who on an annual basis generate million or more of landstar revenue million dollar agents 
management believes future revenue growth is primarily dependent on its ability to increase both the revenue generated by million dollar agents and the number of million dollar agents through a combination of recruiting new agents and increasing the revenue opportunities generated by existing independent commission sales agents 
the following table shows the number of million dollar agents  the average revenue generated by these agents and the percent of consolidated revenue generated by these agents during the past three fiscal years fiscal year number of million dollar agents average revenue generated per million dollar agent percent of consolidated revenue generated by million dollar agents management monitors business activity by tracking the number of loads volume and revenue per load generated by the carrier and global logistics segments 
in addition  management tracks revenue per revenue mile  average length of haul and total revenue miles at the carrier segment 
revenue per revenue mile and revenue per load collectively  price as well as the number of loads  can be influenced by many factors which do not necessarily indicate a change in price or volume 
those factors include the average length of haul  freight type  special handling and equipment requirements and delivery time requirements 
the following table summarizes this data by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years fiscal year carrier segment external revenue generated through in thousands bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers revenue per revenue mile revenue per load average length of haul miles number of loads global logistics segment external revenue generated through in thousands bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail  air  ocean and bus carriers revenue per load number of loads includes revenue from freight hauled by carrier segment bco independent contractors for global logistics customers

number of loads and revenue per load for the and fiscal years exclude the effect of  and  respectively  of revenue derived from disaster relief efforts provided primarily under a contract with the faa as discussed further in the paragraphs that follow 
see the section use of non gaap financial measures on page also critical to the company s success is its ability to secure capacity  particularly truck capacity  at rates that allow the company to profitably transport customers freight 
the following table summarizes available truck capacity providers as of the end of the three most recent fiscal years dec 
 dec 
 dec 
 bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers approved and active other approved total available truck capacity providers number of trucks provided by bco independent contractors active refers to truck brokerage carriers who moved at least one load in the days immediately preceding the fiscal year end 
historically  the company s carrier segment has primarily relied on capacity provided by bco independent contractors 
pursuant to a continuing plan to augment its available capacity and increase its revenue  the company has been increasing the carrier segment s use of capacity provided by truck brokerage carriers 
the percent of consolidated revenue generated through all truck brokerage carriers was during  during and during the company incurs costs that are directly related to the transportation of freight that include purchased transportation and commissions to agents 
the company incurs indirect costs associated with the transportation of freight that include other operating costs and insurance and claims 
in addition  the company incurs selling  general and administrative costs essential to administering its business operations 
management continually monitors all components of the costs incurred by the company and establishes annual cost budgets which  in general  are used to benchmark costs incurred on a monthly basis 
purchased transportation represents the amount a bco independent contractor or other third party capacity provider is paid to haul freight 
the amount of purchased transportation paid to a bco independent contractor is primarily based on a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue generated by the haul 
purchased transportation for the brokerage services operations of the carrier segment is based on a negotiated rate for each load hauled 
purchased transportation for the brokerage services operations of the global logistics segment is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or a contractually agreed upon rate 
purchased transportation for the rail intermodal  air and ocean freight operations of the global logistics segment is based on a contractually agreed upon fixed rate 
purchased transportation for bus services is based upon a negotiated rate per mile or per day 
purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue for truck brokerage services  rail intermodal and bus operations is normally higher than that of landstar s other transportation operations 
purchased transportation is the largest component of costs and expenses and  on a consolidated basis  increases or decreases in proportion to the revenue generated through bco independent contractors  other third party capacity providers and revenue from the insurance segment 
commissions to agents are based on contractually agreed upon percentages of revenue or gross profit  defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation  at the carrier segment and of gross profit at the 
table of contents global logistics segment 
commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue will vary directly with fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the carrier segment  the global logistics segment and the insurance segment and with changes in gross profit at the global logistics segment and the truck brokerage operations of the carrier segment 
trailing equipment rent  maintenance costs for trailing equipment  bco independent contractor recruiting costs and bad debts from bco independent contractors and independent commission sales agents are the largest components of other operating costs 
potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable 
landstar s retained liability for individual commercial trucking claims depends on when such claims are incurred 
for commercial trucking claims incurred prior to june  and subsequent to march   landstar retains liability up to  per occurrence 
for commercial trucking claims incurred from june  through march   landstar retains liability up to  per occurrence 
the company also retains liability for each general liability claim up to   for each workers compensation claim and  for each cargo claim 
the company s exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by other third party capacity providers who haul freight on behalf of the company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which they maintain their own insurance coverage 
a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents  cargo or workers compensation claims or the unfavorable development of existing claims could be expected to materially adversely affect landstar s results of operations 
employee compensation and benefits account for over half of the company s selling  general and administrative costs 
depreciation and amortization primarily relate to depreciation of trailing equipment and management information services equipment

the increase in investment income was primarily due to an increased rate of return  attributable to a general increase in interest rates  on investments held by the insurance segment 
purchased transportation was of revenue in compared with in the decrease in purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to increased revenue provided for disaster relief services under the faa contract which tends to have a lower cost of purchased transportation and lower rates paid to truck brokerage carriers for non faa related revenue 
these reductions in costs were partially offset by an increase in revenue generated through truck brokerage which tends to have a higher cost of purchased transportation compared to revenue generated through bco independent contractors 
commissions to agents were of revenue in and of revenue in the increase in commissions to agents as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to a change in revenue mix and the increase in gross profit on truck brokerage loads

the provisions for income taxes for the and fiscal years were based on estimated full year combined effective income tax rates of approximately and  respectively  which are higher than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily as a result of state income taxes and the meals and entertainment exclusion 
the increase in the combined effective income tax rate was primarily attributable to increased apportionment of income to states having higher tax rates and changes in tax laws enacted by a number of states in which the company operates

also  in this annual report on form k  landstar provided the following information that may be deemed non gaap financial measures for the fiscal year selling  general and administrative costs  excluding the costs to defend and settle the gulf bridge roro  inc litigation  as a percentage of revenue  earnings per common share before costs to defend and settle the gulf bridge roro  inc litigation  earnings per diluted share before costs to defend and settle the gulf bridge roro  inc litigation  and net income excluding costs relating to the defense and settlement of the gulf bridge roro  inc litigation 
each of the foregoing financial measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  the corresponding gaap financial information also presented in the press release 
management believes that it is appropriate to present these financial measures for the following reasons a significant portion of the emergency relief transportation services were provided under the faa contract on the basis of a daily rate for the use of transportation equipment in question  and therefore load and per load information is not necessarily available or appropriate for a significant portion of the related revenue  the circumstances relating to the gulf bridge roro  inc litigation are unusual and unique and thus are not likely to recur as part of landstar s normal operations  disclosure of the effect of the emergency transportation services provided by landstar relating to disaster relief efforts for the storms that impacted the united states during and and the settlement of the gulf bridge roro  inc litigation will allow investors to better understand the underlying trends in landstar s financial condition and results of operations  this information will facilitate comparisons by investors of landstar s results as compared to the results of peer companies  and management considers these financial measures in its decision making

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in trade receivables resulting in large part from revenue related to the emergency transportation services provided under the faa contract 
the financing of a portion of this  receivable from the faa with borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement is the primary reason for the increase in long term debt 
on july   landstar renegotiated its existing credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and jpmorgan chase bank  as administrative agent the fourth amended and restated credit agreement 
the fourth amended and restated credit agreement provides  of borrowing capacity in the form of a revolving credit facility   of which may be utilized in the form of letter of credit guarantees

the fourth amended and restated credit agreement provides for a restriction on cash dividends on the company s capital stock only to the extent there is an event of default under the fourth amended and restated credit agreement 
historically  the company has generated sufficient operating cash flow to meet its debt service requirements  fund continued growth  both internal and through acquisitions  pay dividends and to meet working capital needs 
as a non asset based provider of transportation capacity and logistics services  the company s annual capital requirements for operating property are generally for trailers and management information services equipment 
in addition  a significant portion of the trailing equipment used by the company is provided by third party capacity providers and through leases at rental rates that vary with the revenue generated through the use of the leased equipment  thereby reducing the company s capital requirements 
during  the company purchased  of operating property and acquired  of trailing equipment by entering into capital leases 
landstar anticipates acquiring approximately  of operating property during fiscal year either by purchase or by lease financing 
prior to  the company historically funded its acquisition of company provided fixed cost trailing equipment using capital leases 
during and  the company acquired van trailing equipment under a long term operating lease at a fixed monthly rental price per trailer 
it is expected that capital leases will fund any significant acquisitions of company provided trailing equipment made during the company does not currently anticipate any other significant capital requirements in since  the company has purchased  of its common stock under programs authorized by the board of directors of the company in open market and private block transactions

legal matters on november   the owner operator independent drivers association  inc ooida and six individual bco independent contractors the plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint the complaint in the united states district court for the middle district of florida the court in jacksonville  florida  against the company 
the complaint alleges that certain aspects of the company s motor carrier leases with its bco independent contractors violate certain federal leasing regulations and seeks injunctive relief  an unspecified amount of damages and attorney s fees 
on march and june   the court dismissed all claims of one of the six individual plaintiffs on the grounds that the icc termination act the act is not applicable to leases signed before the act s january   effective date  and dismissed all claims of all remaining plaintiffs against four of the seven company entities previously named as defendants 
claims currently survive against the following company entities landstar inway  inc  landstar ligon  inc 
and landstar ranger  inc 
the defendants 
with respect to the remaining claims  the june  order held that the act created a private right of action to which a four year statute of limitation applies 
on april   plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that included additional allegations with respect to violations of certain federal leasing regulations 
on august   the court granted a motion by plaintiffs to certify the case as a class action 
on october   the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit denied the defendants petition for permission to file an interlocutory appeal of the class certification order 
discovery is ongoing in the case  which is set for a jury trial in october on january   the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment on liability 
on february   the defendants filed their opposition to that motion and their own motion for partial summary judgment to address the claims of the amended complaint 
the defendants motion for partial summary judgment filed february  supersedes and replaces prior motions for partial summary judgment filed with the court on april and june  on march   the plaintiffs filed their opposition to the defendants motion for partial summary judgement 
the district court is expected to rule prior to trial on the pending motions for partial summary judgment 
due to a number of factors  including the unresolved motions for summary judgment  the incomplete state of discovery in this matter  particularly classwide discovery  the absence of final expert reports and the lack of litigated final judgments in a number of similar cases or otherwise applicable precedents  the company does not believe it is in a position to conclude whether or not there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse outcome in this case or what damages  if any  plaintiffs would be awarded should they prevail on all or any part of their claims 
however  the company believes it has meritorious defenses  including to the expanded allegations in the amended complaint  and it intends to continue asserting these defenses vigorously 
the company is involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business 
based on knowledge of the facts and  in certain cases  opinions of outside counsel  management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such other claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome  after provisions thereof  will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company  but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts for both trade and other receivables represents management s estimate of the amount of outstanding receivables that will not be collected 
historically  management s estimates for uncollectible receivables have been materially correct 
although management believes the amount of the allowance for both trade and other receivables at december  is appropriate  a prolonged period of low or no economic growth may adversely affect the collection of these receivables 
conversely  a 
table of contents more robust economic environment may result in the realization of some portion of the estimated uncollectible receivables 
landstar provides for the estimated costs of self insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis 
the amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the balance sheet date 
the ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by management 
historically  the company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior year claims estimates 
the company is continually revising its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim 
during fiscal year  insurance and claims costs included  of favorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates 
during fiscal years and  insurance and claims costs included  and  respectively  of unfavorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate outcome of settling all outstanding claims will be more or less than the estimated claims reserve at december  the company utilizes certain income tax planning strategies to reduce its overall cost of income taxes 
upon audit  it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
the company has provided for its estimated exposure attributable to income tax planning strategies 
management believes that the provision for liabilities resulting from the implementation of income tax planning strategies is appropriate 
to date  the company has not experienced an examination by governmental revenue authorities that would lead management to believe that the company s past provisions for exposures related to income tax planning strategies are not appropriate 
significant variances from management s estimates for the amount of uncollectible receivables  the ultimate resolution of claims or the provision for liabilities for income tax planning strategies can be expected to positively or negatively affect landstar s earnings in a given quarter or year 
however  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these items  given a range of reasonably likely outcomes  will not significantly affect the long term financial condition of landstar or its ability to fund its continuing operations 
effects of inflation management does not believe inflation has had a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of landstar in the past five years 
however  inflation higher than that experienced in the past five years might have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
seasonality landstar s operations are subject to seasonal trends common to the trucking industry 
results of operations for the quarter ending in march are typically lower than the quarters ending june  september and december
