our market strength is low volume  high mix production  particularly with complex products 
our investment in the mexico operation in allows for expansion into medium volume  medium mix and lower cost production and our contractual arrangements with chinese manufacturers allow us to meet high volume  low mix and lower cost customer requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require us to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  known trends in the industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to customers  when title has passed  all contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in the normal course of business we enter into a number of contracts with customers under which we provide engineering services on a per project basis 
revenue for these services is recognized upon completion of the engineering process  usually upon initial shipment of the product 
revenues from repair services are recognized upon shipment of related equipment to customers 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we analyze accounts receivable  historical write offs of bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we have not experienced significant bad debts expense and the reserve for uncollectible accounts of  is considered adequate for any exposure to loss in the december  accounts receivable 
inventory reserves inventory reserves are maintained for the estimated value of the inventory that may have a lower value than stated or quantities in excess of future production needs 
we have an evaluation process that is used to assess the value of the inventory that is slow moving  excess or obsolete on a quarterly basis 
we believe the total reserve of million at december  is adequate 
long lived and intangible asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
the evaluation is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the underlying assets 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets  a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to equal estimated fair value 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
the estimates associated with the asset impairment tests are considered critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
income taxes our estimate of the tax rates utilized in the calculation of the deferred tax balances is based on historical taxable income and expected future taxable income and corresponding rates 
further  our consideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is based upon estimates of taxable income in future periods and future realizability of these assets 
self insured health claim accruals we estimate our reserve for employee health claims based on health claims incurred  historical lag times and an analysis of claims activity during the period  while taking into consideration insurance limits and coverage 
we believe the total accrual of  at december  is adequate 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our financial position 
this is not to suggest that other general risk factors  such as changes in worldwide economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in materials costs  performance of acquired businesses and others  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
no matters have come to our attention since december  that would cause the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements to change materially

in addition to the extension of the maturity date  the financial covenants were modified and include minimum working capital  tangible net worth and net income requirements  along with certain other ratios 
the availability under the line is subject to borrowing base requirements  and advances are at the discretion of the lender 
the line is secured by substantially all of our assets 
this commitment is summarized as described below other commercial commitment total amount committed outstanding at december  date of expiration line of credit january  as of december   our cash and cash equivalent balances totaled on december   we had working capital of approximately million as compared to million at the end of during  we generated approximately million of cash flow from operating activities 
the cash flow from operations is the result of net income of million adjusted for noncash depreciation  amortization  foreign currency transaction loss  and the change in deferred taxes  which totaled million in net positive adjustments  and the net increase in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the net increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily attributable to the increases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million  which were offset by an increase in accounts payable of million due to the volume growth and extended terms and conditions with some of our key suppliers

net cash used in financing activities of million consisted primarily of paying down our line of credit by million along with a net decrease in long term debt of million  which was offset by the increase in our checks in excess of our bank balance of million and issuance of shares of common stock of million 
our liquidity and capital resources are strong  and we believe that our future financial requirements can be met with funds generated from the operating activities and our operating line of credit

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused  for example  by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate and unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the mexican peso 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
our financial advisors  both internal and external  provide ongoing advice regarding trends that affect management s assessment 
exchange rate sensitivity we conduct operations in mexico 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates 
we do not use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the risk of change in foreign currency exchange rates 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the mexico subsidiary s local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of the subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for the purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
we do not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on earnings 
interest rate sensitivity the effective interest rate on our credit facilities are influenced by the actions of the federal reserve in establishing from time to time the federal funds interest rate which is the rate banks borrow from the federal reserve bank 
during and  the federal reserve implemented a number of reductions in the federal funds interest rate in an effort to stimulate the us economy 
as a result the effective interest rate that we paid on our borrowings under the facilities declined  leading to a corresponding reduction in interest expense 
however  in the latter half of and throughout  the federal reserve increased the federal funds interest rate  causing the effective interest rate on our facilities to increase 
based on the balance outstanding under our interest bearing facilities at year end  a percentage point change in the effective interest rate would change interest expense by less than  annually
