except for the historical information contained herein  the matters addressed herein constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
forward looking statements  such as statements of the company s strategies  plans  objectives  expectations and intentions  are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements

overview the company is the leading distributor of aftermarket collision parts used in the repair of automobiles and light trucks in north america  with locations throughout the united states and canada 
these product offerings  consisting of more than  stock keeping units  are manufactured by independent manufacturers and are sold primarily to collision repair shops 
approximately of all of the collision repair work is paid for in part through insurance claims 
as a consequence  the company is dependent upon the acceptance of its products in the first instance by insurance companies and then by the collision repair shop performing the repairs 
before  substantially all collision replacements parts were manufactured by original equipment manufacturers oems 
since then  aftermarket parts  which generally sell for between and less than comparable oem parts  have provided a lower cost alternative to insurance companies seeking to contain the escalating cost of collision repairs 
however  aftermarket collision parts still account for substantially less than of the collision parts market  which is still dominated by the oems 
because of the company s dependence on the acceptance of its products by insurance companies  its business is vulnerable to actions that impact the insurance industry 
during the past five years  the company s sales and profits have been adversely impacted by class action litigation against insurance companies for specifying aftermarket parts  a concerted effort  generally led by the oems  their dealer network and some collision repair shops  to have legislation passed at the state level restricting or eliminating the use of aftermarket parts in the repair of damaged vehicles and more recently litigation against the company alleging infringement of oem trademarks and design patents 
see risk factors above 
other important risks which may impact the company s financial results  include the fact that because the company s business is dependent on a continued source of supply of many automotive body parts which at present are only available from taiwan  it is vulnerable to any disruptions in shipping  increased shipping costs and the relationship of the us dollar to the new taiwan dollar 
challenges currently facing the company include controlling costs  managing its growth and integrating its acquisitions 
escalating costs of audits  sarbanes oxley compliance  health care and commercial insurance  raw materials prices and fuel costs are also challenges for the company at this time 
growth opportunities for the company include expanding its geographical coverage and increasing its penetration of existing markets through acquisitions  as well as start ups  internal growth and expanding into new product markets  such as retail sales through retail parts distributors and offering the company s products on the web 
the company s financial position remains strong  as evidenced by a current ratio current assets to current liabilities of at march   and by the generation of substantial cash flows from operations 
depending upon the size of any acquisitions  the company may be dependent on its bank line of credit to finance them 

table of contents general fiscal contained weeks as compared to weeks in fiscal consequently  comparisons of results  other than as a percentage of net sales  may not be meaningful 
in september  the company voluntarily suspended the sale of aftermarket headlamps for the ford taurus and for the general motors pontiac grand am as a result of independent tests indicating that these headlamps do not fully comply with federal standards 
the company s primary supplier of these headlamps advised the company that it had brought the headlamps into compliance with federal standards  supplying the company with the results of tests by an independent laboratory 
effective in april  the company again began selling the above mentioned headlamps 
as a result of the publication of the initial independent test results  several insurance companies have indicated that they have discontinued specifying all aftermarket lights in vehicle repair 
sales of lighting products during fiscal  constituted approximately of total sales as compared to during fiscal beginning in october  capa began certifying lighting products and to date  approximately lighting applications have been certified 
it is anticipated that further lighting applications will be certified during fiscal as lights are certified  certain insurance companies have generally begun again using these parts in the repair of policyholders vehicles 
lease accounting charge during fiscal  the company adjusted its accounting for rent under its various operating leases in accordance with the requirements of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
requires the company to record straight line lease expenses over the term of the lease when a lease contains a fixed rent escalation clause 
the company had been recording the actual rent expense for each year of the lease 
as a result  the company recorded an adjustment of million  net of tax  million  net of tax  related to fiscal years prior to  substantially all of which was recorded as additional selling and distribution expenses 
prior year s financial statements were not restated due to the immateriality of the amount to the statement of income and statement of cash flows for or any prior individual year 
as the correction relates solely to accounting treatment  it did not affect the company s historical or future cash flows 
critical accounting policies general 
the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  insurance  pensions and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company adjusts its 
table of contents allowance monthly based upon a formula relating to the aging of its receivables 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
leases and leasehold improvements 
the company leases certain distribution centers  office space  equipment and vehicles 
the company has over leases and no one lease is material to the operations of the company 
the company accounts for its leases under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and subsequent amendments  which require that leases be evaluated and classified as operating leases or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
certain leases contain rent escalation clauses  which are recorded on a straight line basis over the initial term of the lease with the difference between the rent paid and the straight line rent recorded as a deferred rent liability 
lease incentive payments received from landlords are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term as a reduction in rent 
in addition  leasehold improvements associated with these operating leases are amortized over the shorter of their economic lives or the respective lease terms 
the term of each lease is generally the initial term of the lease unless external economic factors were to exist such that renewals potentially provided for in the establishing an amortization period and determining if such lease qualified as a capital or operating lease 
self insured reserves 
the company is self insured for general and automobile liability  workers compensation and the health care claims of its team members  although the company maintains stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit its total liability exposure 
a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported based upon our estimate of ultimate cost  which is calculated using analyses of historical data and valuations provided by third party actuaries 
management monitors new claims and claim development as well as negative trends related to the claims incurred but not reported in order to assess the adequacy of our insurance reserves 
while the company does not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  our self insurance reserves and corresponding selling  general and administrative expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions 
acquisitions during fiscal  and  the company completed two  three and six acquisitions  respectively 
all of these acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and the consolidated financial statements include the results of operations for each business for all periods subsequent to the applicable purchase date

gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  primarily as a result of a more favorable product mix  price adjustments made during the third quarter of fiscal and lower inventory control costs 
the company s gross profit margin has fluctuated  and is expected to continue to fluctuate  depending on a number of factors  including changes in product prices  product mix  competition and the strength of the united states dollar relative to the taiwanese dollar 
selling and distribution expenses increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase in these expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to increased fuel costs million

as a result of the above factors  the company experienced a decrease in net income in fiscal to million  as compared to net income of million in fiscal variability of quarterly results and seasonality the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  variations in its sales and profitability from quarter to quarter due  in part  to the timing and integration of acquisitions and the seasonal nature of keystone s business 
the number of collision repairs is directly impacted by the weather 
accordingly  the company s sales generally are highest during the five month period from december through april 
the impact of seasonality has reduced somewhat as keystone has become more geographically diversified 
other factors which influence quarterly variations include the number of business days during the holiday seasons  the timing of the introduction of new products  the level of consumer acceptance of new products  the timing of supplier price changes and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales and customer delivery requirements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary use of funds over the past two years has been for acquisitions  the development and implementation of an enterprise wide management information system and to finance the growth in sales 
at march   working capital was million compared to million at april  the company financed its working capital requirements and the acquisitions completed during fiscal primarily from cash flow from operations  and borrowings under its credit facility 
during the year ended march   the company s cash and cash equivalents increased by 
million 
this increase is the result of cash provided by operating activities of million  and offset by cash used in investing activities of million  primarily as a result of cash used for acquisitions  to purchase property and 
table of contents equipment and cash provided in financing activities of million primarily from million increase under the bank credit facility  and million of proceeds from stock option exercises 
the cash provided by operating activities resulted from net income of million increased by million of non cash expenses and partially offset by a 
million decrease in cash from changes in working capital components 
the working capital component change primarily reflects an increase in inventories and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively  offset by an increase in accounts payable of million 
the most significant non cash expenses were depreciation and amortization of million and a million provision for a write down of inventories and losses on uncollectible accounts receivable of million 
the company has in place a million revolving secured line of credit with commercial lenders that matures on october  the company has the option to expand the credit facility to million 
advances under the revolving line of credit bear interest either at libor plus or at the lender s prime rate 
at march   million had been drawn down under the line of credit 
the line of credit is subject to certain restrictive covenants set forth in the loan agreement  which requires that the company maintain certain financial ratios 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants at march   and at the date of the filing of this annual report 
the company has outstanding lines of credit in the aggregate amount of million issued to its primary insurers to secure the company s deductible reimbursement obligations 
the amount of these letters of credit reduces the funds available under the company s credit facility 
the company believes that its existing working capital  anticipated cash flow from operations and funds anticipated to be available under its line of credit will enable it to finance its operations  including concluding possible acquisitions for at least the next months 
however  the company s liquidity expectations are subject to numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
anticipated cash flow from operations are subject to the risks of the business  the most significant of which are discussed under business cautionary statements above 
especially important are the risks discussed under item business cautionary statements litigation impacting aftermarket collision replacement parts and business cautionary statements federal and state action  above 
since the company s product sales are so dependent upon the acceptance of aftermarket parts by insurance companies  adverse judgments or restrictive legislation could reduce sales and negatively impact cash flow from operations 
the availability of funds under the company s line of credit could also be restricted or eliminated in the event that the company does not maintain the financial ratios required under the credit agreement 
these ratios include such items as amount of indebtedness  earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization  net worth and the current ratio 
in the event that the company s operations do not meet expectations it is possible that needed liquidity will not be available under the credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table quantifies our future contractual obligations as of march  payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years in thousands operating leases credit facility outstanding purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the total revolving line of credit commitment under the company s credit facility is million  which expires on october  as of march   there were standby letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility of million  which expire in december the amount of outstanding letters of credit reduce the availability under the credit facility 

table of contents primarily represents contractual obligations relating to the company s management information systems  including the outsourcing of its data center operation  obligations under its primary telecom agreement and obligations with respect to its logistical support network related to inventory 
primarily amounts due under the company s defined benefit plan  which is frozen 
inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation over the past three years have had a significant effect on its net sales or its profitability 
long lived assets goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to million at march   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
goodwill amounted to million at april   or approximately of total assets or of consolidated shareholders equity 
the increase in goodwill from april  was the result of the completion of two acquisitions 
other intangible assets  consisting primarily of covenants not to compete obtained in acquisitions  which have finite lives  will continue to be amortized over the finite life 
as of march   other intangible assets amounted to million 
for the years ended march  and april   amortization of other intangible assets was approximately and million  respectively 
the company reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets as required by sfas no 
and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised statement  share based payment statement r  to address the accounting for stock based employee plans 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using accounting principles board abp opinion no 
and instead requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method of accounting 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted statement r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of proforma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
statement r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows in periods after adoption 
statement r  as recently amended  is effective the beginning of the first fiscal year which begins after june  consequently  statement r will not impact the company until the beginning of fiscal and the adoption of statement r is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of apb no 
 chapter sfas 
sfas amends accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overhead to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
sfas is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after 
table of contents june  the company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or cash flows 
in june  the fasb emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements eitf 
the guidance requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of the business combination or purchase 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s results of operations are subject to changes in interest rates primarily with respect to borrowings under its credit facility  where interest rates are tied to the prime rate or libor 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
based on the company s current levels of debt  the exposure to interest rate fluctuations is not considered to be material 
the company is also exposed to currency fluctuations  primarily with respect to its product purchases in taiwan and its operations in canada 
while all transactions with taiwan are conducted in us dollars  changes in the relationship between the us dollar and the new taiwan dollar might impact the price of products purchased in taiwan 
the company might not be able to pass on any price increases to customers 
the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income of our canadian operations are translated into us dollars at the current and average exchange rates  respectively 
under its present policies  the company does not attempt to hedge its currency exchange rate exposure
