during fiscal and fiscal there were no borrowings under the bank of america facility 
accordingly  as of july  and july   there were no outstanding borrowings under the bank of america facility

coach experiences significant seasonal variations in its working capital requirements 
during the first fiscal quarter coach builds inventory for the holiday selling season  opens new retail stores and generates higher levels of trade receivables 
in the second fiscal quarter its working capital requirements are reduced substantially as coach generates consumer sales and collects wholesale accounts receivable 
in fiscal  coach purchased approximately million of inventory  which was funded by on hand cash  operating cash flow and by borrowings under the japanese revolving credit facilities 
management believes that cash flow from operations and on hand cash will provide adequate funds for the foreseeable working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and the common stock repurchase program 
any future acquisitions  joint ventures or other similar transactions may require additional capital 
there can be no assurance that any such capital will be available to coach on acceptable terms or at all 
coach s ability to fund its working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  as well as to comply with all of the financial covenants under its debt agreements  depends on its future operating performance and cash flow  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond coach s control 
prior to coach s spin off from the sara lee corporation sara lee  sara lee was a guarantor or a party to many of coach s leases 
coach has agreed to make efforts to remove sara lee from all of its existing leases  and sara lee is not a guarantor or a party to any new or renewed leases 
coach has obtained a letter of credit for the benefit of sara lee in an amount approximately equal to the annual minimum rental payments under leases transferred to coach by sara lee  but for which sara lee retains contingent liability 
coach is required to maintain this letter of credit until the annual minimum rental payments under the relevant leases are less than million 
the initial letter of credit had a face amount of million  and we expect this amount to decrease annually as coach s guaranteed obligations are reduced 
as of july   the letter of credit was million 
we expect that we will be required to maintain the letter of credit for approximately years 
as of july   the scheduled maturities of coach s long term contractual obligations are as follows

coach does not have any off balance sheet financing or unconsolidated special purpose entities 
coach s risk management policies prohibit the use of derivatives for trading purposes 
the valuation of financial instruments that are marked to market are based upon independent third party sources 
long term debt coach is party to an industrial revenue bond related to its jacksonville  florida distribution and consumer service facility 
this loan has a remaining balance of million and bears interest at 
principal and interest payments are made semiannually  with the final payment due in seasonality because its products are frequently given as gifts  coach has historically realized  and expects to continue to realize  higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year  which 
table of contents includes the holiday months of november and december 
in addition  fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales 
however  over the past several years  we have achieved higher levels of growth in the non holiday quarters  which has reduced these seasonal fluctuations 
we expect these trends to continue 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and  as such  requires the use of judgment 
actual results may vary from estimates in amounts that may be material to the financial statements 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical because changes to certain judgments and assumptions inherent in these policies could affect the financial statements 
the areas of accounting that involve significant judgments and estimates are inventories  share based compensation  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and revenue recognition 
in certain instances  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods 
the company s significant policy that involves the selection of an alternative method is accounting for inventories 
for more information on coach s accounting policies  please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventories us inventories are valued at the lower of cost determined by the first in  first out method or market 
inventories in japan are valued at the lower of cost determined by the last in  first out method or market 
inventory costs include material  conversion costs  freight and duties 
reserves for slow moving and aged merchandise are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
we evaluate the adequacy of reserves quarterly 
a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes  buying patterns or increased competition could impact coach s evaluation of its slow moving and aged merchandise 
share based compensation during the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment  which requires an entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
previously  the company accounted for stock based compensation plans and the employee stock purchase plan in accordance with apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
the company elected to adopt the modified retrospective application method as provided by sfas r and accordingly  all financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the cost of such awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
the determination of the grant date fair value of the awards involves several assumptions  including expected term of the option and future volatility 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company s stock as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded options on coach s stock 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  which are separately tested for impairment  are evaluated for impairment annually to determine if the carrying value of the assets is recoverable 
the evaluation is based on a review of forecasted operating cash flows and the profitability of the related business 
the company did not record any impairment losses in fiscal   or 
table of contents goodwill and intangible assets the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually for impairment 
in order to complete our impairment analysis  we must perform a valuation analysis which includes determining the fair value of the company s reporting units based on discounted cash flows 
this analysis contains uncertainties as it requires management to make assumptions and estimate the profitability of future growth strategies 
the company determined that there was no impairment in fiscal  or revenue recognition sales are recognized at the point of sale  which occurs when merchandise is sold in an over the counter consumer transaction or  for the wholesale  internet and catalog channels  upon shipment of merchandise  when title passes to the customer 
allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts  discounts  returns and allowances are provided when sales are recorded based upon historical experience and current trends 
royalty revenues are earned through license agreements with manufacturers of other consumer products that incorporate the coach brand 
revenue earned under these contracts is recognized based upon reported net sales from the licensee
