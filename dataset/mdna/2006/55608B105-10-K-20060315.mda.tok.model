general the trust is a delaware statutory trust that was formed on april  the company is a delaware limited liability company that was also formed on april  the trust is the sole holder of of the llc interests of the company 
prior to december   the trust was a wholly owned subsidiary of mimusa 
we own  operate and invest in a diversified group of infrastructure businesses  that are providing basic  everyday services  such as parking  roads and water  through long life physical assets 
these infrastructure businesses generally operate in sectors with limited competition and high barriers to entry 
as a result  they have sustainable and growing long term cash flows 
we operate and finance our businesses in a manner that maximizes these cash flows 
the company is dependent upon cash distributions from its businesses and investments to meet its corporate overhead and to pay management fee expenses and to pay dividends 
the company expects to receive dividends from its airport services business  airport parking business and district energy business through its directly owned holding company macquarie infrastructure company inc  or mic inc 
the company will receive interest and principal on our subordinated loans to  and dividends from  its toll road business and dividends from its investments in macquarie communications infrastructure group  or mcg  and south east water  or sew  through directly owned holding companies that it has formed to hold its interest in each business and investment 
distributions received from our businesses and investments net of taxes  are available first to meet management fees and corporate overhead expenses then to fund dividend payments by the company to the trust for payment to holders of trust stock 
base management and performance fees payable to our manager are allocated between the company and the directly owned subsidiaries based on the company s internal allocation policy 
on may  our board of directors declared a dividend of per share for the quarter ended march   and an additional dividend of per share for the period ended december  the dividend payments were made on june  to holders of record on june  on august   our board of directors declared a dividend of per share for the quarter ended june  the dividend payments were made on september  to holders of record on september  additionally  on november   our board of directors declared a dividend of per share for the quarter ended september  this dividend was paid on december  to holders of record on december  on march   our board of directors declared a dividend of per share payable on april  to holders of record on april  
table of contents tax treatment of distributions at the time of our initial public offering  or ipo  we anticipated that substantially all of the portion of our regular distributions that are treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes should qualify for taxation at the lower us federal income tax rate currently applicable to qualified dividend income currently a maximum of 
in  substantially all of the distributions from mic inc to the company  the trust and ultimately the holders of our trust stock were treated as return of capital for us federal income tax purposes rather than as qualified dividend income 
distributions to holders of our trust stock that are treated as return of capital for us federal income tax purposes are generally not taxable in the hands of holders to the extent that the total amount of such distributions received does not exceed the holders tax basis in the trust stock 
instead such distributions that are not in excess of the holders tax basis in the trust stock will reduce such holders tax basis in the trust stock resulting in more capital gain or less capital loss upon ultimate disposal of the trust stock 
distributions from mic inc were million in  representing of the total distributions received by the company from our businesses and investments in calendar year in addition  we received distributions from sew in amounting to million  or of these total distributions  that did not qualify for the reduced tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income 
as a consequence  the portion of our distributions for that are treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes was lower than expected  and the portion of our distributions that were treated as return of capital for us federal income tax purposes were higher than expected 
further  the portion of our distributions that were treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes and characterized as qualified dividend income was lower than expected while still comprising a majority of the portion of our distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes 
beyond  the portion of our distributions that will be treated as dividends or return of capital for us federal income tax purposes is subject to a number of uncertainties 
we currently anticipate that substantially all of the portion of our regular distributions that are treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes should be characterized as qualified dividend income 
we expect that future distributions from sew will qualify for required rates applicable to qualified dividend income 
the ipo and completed acquisitions on december   we completed our ipo and concurrent private placement  issuing a total of  shares of trust stock at a price of per share 
total gross proceeds were million before offering costs and underwriting fees of million 
mimusa purchased two million shares million of the total shares outstanding  through a private placement 
the majority of the proceeds were used to acquire our initial infrastructure businesses and investment 
we acquired our airport services  district energy and toll road businesses and made our investments in sew and mcg on december  and acquired our airport parking business on december  these acquisitions were effected by purchasing the shares of north america capital holding company  or nach  macquarie airports north america  inc  or mana  macquarie district energy holdings  llc  or mdeh  macquarie americas parking corporation  or mapc  macquarie yorkshire limited  or myl  stapled securities in mcg and ordinary shares and preferred equity certificates  or pecs  in macquarie luxembourg 
on january  we acquired general aviation holdings  llc  or gah  which became a subsidiary of nach 
consequently  the results of gah from the date of its acquisition are reflected in our airport services business results of operations for the year ended december  on august   our airport services business acquired all of the membership interests in eagle aviation resources  ltd  or ear  a nevada limited liability company doing business as las vegas executive air terminal 
consequently  the results of ear from the date of its acquisition are reflected in the airport services business results of operations for the year ended december  on october   our airport parking business completed the acquisition of real property and personal and intangible assets related to the sunpark facilities and  on october   acquired an additional property in maricopa  arizona 
consequently  the results of these facilities from the date of acquisition are reflected in the airport parking business results of operations for the year ended december  
table of contents the purchases of our airport services  airport parking and district energy businesses following our ipo were recorded by us using the purchase method of accounting  due to our ability to control each business 
mcg is accounted for as an available for sale investment and sew is recorded under the cost method of accounting 
macquarie yorkshire  through its ownership of connect m a holdings limited  or chl  effectively owns of connect m a limited 
our investment in chl is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the purchases of gah  lve and sunpark were recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
the million purchase price of gah including transaction costs and working capital adjustments was funded through additional long term debt borrowings of million with the remainder funded by proceeds from our initial public offering 
the million purchase price of lve including a preliminary working capital adjustment of  and related transaction costs of million was funded with cash raised in our initial public offering 
the million purchase price of sunpark including million of transaction costs  pre funded reserves and pre funded capital expenditures was funded with a combination of million of cash  the majority of which was raised in our initial public offering  and million of non recourse debt under a new debt facility 
pending acquisitions on august   we entered into a joinder agreement with k ventures limited  k hgc investment  llc together with k ventures  the k parties  and macquarie investment holdings inc  or mihi  and a related assignment agreement with mihi 
under these agreements  we assumed all of mihi s rights and obligations as a buyer under a purchase agreement between mihi and the k parties for no additional consideration other than providing mihi with an indemnification for the liabilities  cost and expenses it has incurred as buyer under the purchase agreement 
the purchase agreement provides for the acquisition by the buyer of  at the option of k ventures  either of the interests in hgc investment or of the membership interests of hgc holdings  llc hgc investment owns a non managing membership interest in hgc holdings  a hawaii limited liability company  and has the right to acquire the remaining membership interest in hgc holdings 
hgc holdings is the sole member of the gas company  llc  a hawaii limited liability company which owns and operates the sole regulated gas distribution business in hawaii as well as a propane sales and distribution business in hawaii 
the purchase agreement provides for the payment in cash of a base purchase price of million subject to working capital and capital expenditure adjustments with no assumed interest bearing debt 
we currently expect working capital and capital expenditure adjustments to add approximately million to the total purchase price 
in addition to the purchase price  it is anticipated that approximately a further million will be paid to cover transaction costs 
we expect to finance the acquisition  including an initial up front deposit of million  with million of future subsidiary level debt and the remainder from proceeds from the refinancing of our airport services segment discussed below or other sources of available cash 
absent an intervening use for the proceeds from this refinancing  we do not intend to issue equity in the public markets to complete the acquisition of the gas company 
on march   the hawaii division of consumer advocacy consumer advocate filed its position statement recommending approval of our application to the hawaii public utilities commission  or hpuc  to transfer ownership of the gas company to us 
the consumer advocate s recommendation was conditioned upon the hpuc accepting the regulatory conditions set forth in the consumer advocate s position statement 
we have discussed these conditions with the consumer advocate and find them acceptable as presented to the hpuc 
we are in the process of preparing a response statement to the hpuc formally accepting the recommended regulatory conditions 
in that response  we will be requesting a decision and order from the hpuc that would allow us to close the transaction  if approved  by early june the gas company has filed an annual report of its financial condition for the year ended december  with the hpuc which included the following unaudited financial information 
we are including 
table of contents this publicly available information because we believe it provides a general understanding of the historical results of the gas company 
however  we have not independently verified this information 
furthermore  according to the filing this information was produced in conformity with accounting standards for regulated utilities  which may not be consistent with us generally accepted accounting principles applicable to non utility businesses 
according to the filing with the hpuc  the regulated gas utility business of the gas company produced pre tax  pre interest net income of million and ebitda of million for the year ended december  the non utility gas distribution business produced pre tax  pre interest net income of million for the same period 
ebitda for the non utility gas distribution business is not presented in the hpuc filing 
ebitda for the gas utility business should not be viewed as an indication of the performance of the non utility business 
net asset value of the non regulated gas distribution business was million at december   compared to net asset value of the gas utility business of million at that date 
the above historical financial information should not be taken as an indication of future performance 
in particular  we would expect interest expense to increase significantly following our acquisition 
the purchase agreement contains various provisions customary for transactions of this size and type  including representations  warranties and covenants with respect to the business that are subject to customary limitations 
completion of the acquisition depends on a number of conditions being satisfied by october   including approval by hpuc of the transaction and the subsidiary level debt financing  numerous contractual consents and the expiration or early termination of any waiting period under the hart scott rodino antitrust act of  as amended  as well as other customary closing conditions 
failure to obtain financing would not permit us to terminate the purchase agreement 
therefore  if we do not obtain sufficient funding for the transaction  we would be required to pay liquidated damages to the seller as described below 
the purchase agreement provides for the payment of liquidated damages equal to of the base purchase price if the transaction is terminated for breach prior to receipt of regulatory approvals and of the base purchase price if terminated for breach thereafter 
in addition  we would be obligated to pay a liquidated damages amount equal to of the base purchase price if approval from hpcu were not obtained due in whole or substantial part to hpuc s findings regarding our financial  legal or operational qualifications 
the maximum amount of indemnification payable by either party under the purchase agreement is of the base purchase price  with some exceptions 
msusa is acting as financial advisor to us on the transaction  including in connection with the debt financing arrangements 
mihi and msusa are both subsidiaries of macquarie bank limited  the parent company of the our manager 
impact of acquisitions on our results of operations the acquisitions of our consolidated businesses and our equity investment in macquarie yorkshire resulted in significant increases in the recorded value of our property  plant and equipment and our intangible assets  including our airport contract rights  customer relationships and technology 
our consolidated results of operations reflect only nine days of the resulting additional depreciation and amortization expense 
our annual depreciation and amortization expense increased as this additional expense was fully reflected in our results 
these acquisitions also resulted in a significant amount of goodwill 
in the last half of  prior to our acquisition of parts of our airport services and district energy businesses  they were recapitalized with significant levels of non recourse debt 
our consolidated interest expense increased in to reflect the full year impact of our additional indebtedness 
simultaneous with our acquisition of our parking business holding company  the holding company increased its economic ownership in the underlying macquarie parking business from to 

table of contents minority shareholders did not contribute their full pro rata share of capital raised for acquisitions in as a result  the holding company increased it ownership in the underlying macquarie parking business from to 
the historical results of the parking business discussed in this section include a larger allocation of net losses to the minority investors 
going forward  we expect to recognize a greater share of the financial performance of our parking business in our consolidated results of operations  reflecting the holding company s increased ownership in macquarie parking 
operating segments and businesses airport services business our airport services business depends upon the level of general aviation activity  and jet fuel consumption  for the largest portion of its revenue 
general aviation activity is in turn a function of economic and demographic growth in the regions serviced by a particular airport and the general rate of economic growth in the united states 
according to estimates from the faa  in and  the number of general aviation turbojet aircraft in the united states  which are the major consumers of the services of our airport services business  increased by and  respectively 
general aviation jet fuel consumption increased in by and declined in by 
the faa estimates that general aviation jet fuel consumption grew by in  by in and is projected to grow in a number of our airports are located near key business centers  for example  new york teterboro  chicago midway and philadelphia 
we believe that as a result the growth in fuel consumption and general aviation activity is higher at our airports than the industry average nationwide 
fuel revenue is a function of the volume sold at each location and the average per gallon sale price 
the average per gallon sale price is a function of our cost of fuel plus  where applicable  fees and taxes paid to airports or other local authorities for each gallon sold cost of revenue fuel  plus our margin 
our fuel gross profit fuel revenue less cost of revenue fuel depends on the volume of fuel sold and the average dollar based margin earned per gallon 
the dollar based margin charged to customers varies based on business considerations 
dollar based margins per gallon are generally insensitive to the wholesale price of fuel with both increases and decreases in the wholesale price of fuel generally passed through to customers  subject to the level of price competition that exists at the various fbos 
our airport services business also earns revenues from activities other than fuel sales non fuel revenue 
for example  our airport services business earns revenues from refueling some general aviation customers and some commercial airlines on a pass through basis  where we act as a fueling agent for fuel suppliers and for commercial airlines  receiving a fee  generally on a per gallon basis 
in addition  our airport services business earns revenue from aircraft landing and parking fees and by providing general aviation customers with other services  such as de icing and hangar rental 
at some facilities we also provide de icing services to commercial airlines 
our airport services business also earns management fees for its operation of six regional airports under management contracts 
in generating non fuel revenue  our airport services business incurs supply expenses cost of revenue non fuel  such as de icing fluid costs and payments to airport authorities  which vary from site to site 
cost of revenue non fuel are directly related to the volume of services provided and therefore generally increase in line with non fuel revenue 
our airport services business incurs expenses in operating and maintaining each fbo  such as rent and insurance  which are generally fixed in nature 
other expenses incurred in operating each fbo  such as salaries  generally increase with the level of activity 
in addition  our airport services business incurs general and administrative expenses at the head office that include senior management expenses as well as accounting  information technology  human resources  environmental compliance and other corporate costs 

table of contents airport parking business the revenues of our airport parking business include both parking and non parking components 
parking revenues  which comprise the substantial majority of total revenues  are driven by the volume of passengers using the airports at which the business operates  its market share at each location and its parking rates 
we aim to grow our parking revenue by increasing our market share at each location and optimizing parking rates taking into consideration local demand and competition 
we compete for market share against other parking facilities on and off airport and to a lesser extent against alternative modes of transport to the airport  such as trains  taxis  private transport or rental cars 
among other factors  market share is driven by the capacity of the parking facility  the proximity of the parking facility to the airport  the quality of service provided and the parking rates 
our airport parking business seeks to increase market share through marketing initiatives to attract both returning customers and air travelers who have not previously used off airport parking and through improved services 
our ability to successfully execute marketing  pricing and service initiatives is key to maintaining and growing revenues 
non parking revenue includes primarily transportation services 
turnover and intra day activity are captured in the cars out or total number of customers exiting during the period 
this measure  in combination with average parking revenue per car out and available overnight occupancy  are primary indicators of our customer mix and dictate our ongoing revenue management efforts 
average parking revenue is a function of the fee for parking  the discount applied  if any  and the number of days the customer is parked at the facility 
for example  an increase in average parking revenue over time can be a result of increased pricing  reduced discounting or a shift in the average length of stay 
our parking business customers pay a fee for parking at its locations 
the parking fees collected constitute revenue earned 
the prices charged are a function of demand  quality of service and competition 
parking rate increases are often led by on airport parking lots and changes in the competitive environment 
most airports have historically increased parking rates rapidly with increases in demand  creating a favorable pricing environment for off airport competitors 
however  in certain markets  the airport may not raise rates in line with general economic trends 
further  our airport parking business seeks to increase parking rates through the value added services such as valet parking  car washes and covered parking 
in the discussion of our airport parking business results of operations  we disclose the average overnight occupancy for each period 
our airport parking business measures occupancy by counting the number of cars at the lowest point of the day between am and am every night 
at this time  customer activity is low  and thus an accurate measure of the car count may be taken at each location 
this method means that turnover and intra day activity are not taken into account and therefore occupancy during the day is likely to be much higher than when the counts are undertaken 
in providing parking services  our airport parking business incurs expenses  such as personnel costs  real estate related costs and the costs of leasing  operating and maintaining its shuttle buses 
these costs are incurred in providing customers with service at each parking lot as well as in transporting them to and from the airport terminal 
generally  as the level of occupancy  or usage  at each of the business locations increases  labor and the other costs related to the operation of each facility increase 
we also incur costs related to damaged cars either as a result of the actions of our employees or criminal activity 
the business is continually reviewing security and safety measures to minimize these costs 
other costs incurred by macquarie parking relate to the provision of the head office function that the business requires to operate 
these costs include marketing and advertising  rents and other general and administrative expenses associated with the head office function 
district energy business our district energy business is comprised of thermal chicago and northwind aladdin  which are and indirectly owned  respectively  by mdeh  which is a wholly owned subsidiary 
thermal 
table of contents chicago sells chilled water to customers in the chicago downtown area and one customer outside of the downtown area under long term contracts 
pursuant to these contracts  thermal chicago receives both capacity and consumption payments 
capacity payments cooling capacity revenue are received irrespective of the volume of chilled water used by a customer and these payments generally increase in line with inflation 
capacity payments constituted approximately of thermal chicago s total revenue in consumption payments cooling consumption revenue are a per unit charge for the volume of chilled water used 
such payments are higher in the summer months when the demand for chilled water is at its highest and  as a consequence  approximately of consumption revenue is received in the second and third quarters of each year 
consumption payments also fluctuate moderately from year to year depending on weather conditions 
by contract  consumption payments generally increase in line with a number of economic indices that reflect the cost of electricity  labor and other input costs relevant to the operations of thermal chicago 
the weighting of the individual economic indices broadly reflects the composition of thermal chicago s direct expenses 
thermal chicago s principal direct expenses in were electricity  labor  operations and maintenance  depreciation and accretion and other 
electricity usage fluctuates in line with the volume of chilled water produced 
thermal chicago particularly focuses on minimizing the amount of electricity consumed per unit of chilled water produced  including by storing thermal energy by producing ice at night when electricity costs are generally lower 
the ice is then used during the day to chill water when electricity costs and consumption are highest 
other direct expenses  including labor  operations and maintenance  depreciation  and general and administrative are largely fixed irrespective of the volumes of chilled water produced 
electric utility restructuring legislation was adopted in illinois in december to provide for a transition to a deregulated generation market scheduled for as discussed under our businesses and investments district energy business business thermal chicago electricity costs in item business 
the legislation included a provision for electric utilities  in our case comed  to collect a customer transition charge ctc from customers who choose to purchase electricity from an alternative retail energy supplier or those who elect comed s power purchase option ppo during the transition period 
under the terms of the ppo plan  if the ctc of any participant is reduced to zero  that participant becomes ineligible to purchase electricity under the ppo plan 
with the recent high cost of market based power  comed s calculation of our ctcs at the beginning of are zero 
as a result  we will no longer be able to purchase electricity under the ppo plan effective may furthermore  comed began to charge transmission charges to its customers that procure energy from retail energy suppliers 
these transmission charges had been charged to one of our plants which is currently under a retail energy supply contract 
beginning in may  these charges will also apply to our plants that are no longer eligible for the ppo plan 
we have reviewed our options to purchase power for the remainder of and have entered into a contract to purchase electricity with a retail energy supplier 
based on an historically normal level of electricity usage  we estimate our electricity costs will increase by  for the remainder of we believe we can mitigate this impact through a combination of operational and strategic initiatives and offsets from our contract escalators 
had we remained on the ppo contracts and based on an historically normal level of electricity usage  we estimate our electricity costs would have increased by million due to the revised ppo rates determined by comed in early the illinois electricity markets are expected to deregulate beginning in january and we will be required to enter into new electricity purchase arrangements effective at that time 
comed has proposed a procurement process referred to as a reverse auction 
the market prices of electricity available to us are likely to reflect prices established in the reverse auction process 
market prices of electricity in illinois are also affected by changes in natural gas prices  which have been very volatile  but overall have increased significantly over the past year 
we cannot predict the market prices for electricity that we will face beginning in but we anticipate  based on current market dynamics  that electricity will cost substantially more in than in the second half of  as discussed above 
if these market dynamics change in a way that is adverse to us  our costs could be substantially higher than we currently anticipate 
in 
table of contents addition  on august   comed filed a rate case with the icc  which seeks  among other things  to increase delivery rates in a manner that we believe disproportionately impacts larger users of electricity 
if the rate case is approved as currently proposed  our electricity costs would increase by an additional million annually 
or million of our consumption revenue for thermal chicago is linked to the midwest producer price index 
the producer price index reflects the cost of electricity across a broad geographic region in the midwest and  as a result  does not fully reflect changes in electricity costs that occur locally 
changes in this index  which are not in our control  combined with recent significant increases in electricity costs discussed above  are likely to result in our electricity costs increasing significantly without a corresponding increase in contracted revenues to fully offset the cost 
in addition  because our contracts typically adjust consumption charges annually  there is likely to be a significant lag before changes in the market prices of electricity are reflected in our contracts overall 
we are currently evaluating the components and calculation of the producer price index and alternative contractual price adjustment options to determine whether our contract provisions will allow us to better offset recent increases in electricity costs described above 
northwind aladdin provides cold and hot water and back up electricity under two long term contracts that expire in february pursuant to these contracts  northwind aladdin receives monthly fixed payments of approximately million per annum through march and monthly fixed payments of approximately million per year thereafter through february in addition  northwind aladdin receives consumption and other variable payments from its customers that allow it to recover substantially all of its operating costs 
approximately of total contract payments are received from the aladdin resort and casino and the balance from the desert passage shopping mall 
in addition to its interest in northwind aladdin  mdeh also owns all of northwind aladdin s senior debt 
this debt pays interest quarterly at a rate of per year and is scheduled to fully amortize by the end of this debt is eliminated in consolidation 
toll road business we own our toll road business through our interest in chl and share control with our joint venture partner balfour beatty plc 
the sole source of revenue of our toll road business is shadow tolls received from the uk government 
this revenue is a function of traffic volume and shadow toll rates 
in general  traffic volume is driven by general economic and demographic growth in the region served 
yorkshire link has been in operation for over six years and traffic volumes have grown continuously over this period 
it is typical for a toll road to show strong traffic growth early in its life as drivers switch from congested alternative routes to the new road and then  as the road matures  for growth to trend toward levels that are reflective of overall economic and demographic growth in the region serviced by the road 
as yorkshire link is a mature toll road  we expect that future traffic growth during the remainder of the concession will be consistent with economic and demographic growth rates 
based on a formula contained in the concession  revenues increase with increases in the volume of traffic using yorkshire link and the rate of inflation in the united kingdom 
if traffic volumes do not increase and there is no inflation  toll rates will decline moderately through time due to the operation of the rate structure under the concession 
also  periodically  a global factor in the formula serves to decrease or increase shadow toll rates 
the payment calculations are discussed further under business our businesses and investments toll road business business in part i  item i 
the operations of yorkshire link are relatively straightforward and therefore cash operating expenses are limited 
this is partially a reflection of the fact that the road is relatively new 
for example  operating expenses  excluding depreciation  comprised only of revenues for the year ended march  the majority of revenues after expenses will be used to service connect m a limited s debt and the remainder will be used to pay distributions to us and our joint venture partner 
operating expenses comprise two components a recurring component that reflects the day to day cost of operating yorkshire link  and periodic maintenance that is necessary to maintain the condition of 
table of contents the road at the standard required by the concession 
day to day operating costs can generally be expected to grow at a rate moderately above the rate of inflation 
as operating costs are low relative to revenues  significant percentage fluctuations in operating costs do not have a correspondingly significant impact on operating income 
we account for our toll road business under the equity method of accounting and record profits and losses from our indirect ownership in chl  net of intangible amortization expense  in the equity in earnings loss and amortization charges of investee line of our statement of operations 
in addition  we record interest income from our subordinated loans to connect m a limited in the interest income line of our statement of operations and interest expense on the loan from connect m a limited in the interest expense line 
investments mcg we hold a minority interest in mcg and do not have any influence over its operations 
therefore  our interest in mcg is accounted for as an available for sale investment and dividends received are included in our statement of operations 
unrealized gains and losses in the share price of mcg are reflected in other comprehensive income section of stockholders equity 
the revenues of mcg are derived mainly from the long term contracts that its businesses  broadcast australia and  since january  arqiva  have entered into to provide broadcast infrastructure in australia and the united kingdom 
as a result  the revenues of mcg are relatively insensitive to fluctuations in macroeconomic conditions in australia and the united kingdom 
sew we hold a minority interest in sew and do not have significant influence over its operations 
therefore  our interest in sew is accounted for as a cost investment and dividends received will be included in our statement of operations 
the uk water industry regulator determines the prices that sew can charge its customers 
these determinations are undertaken every five years using an approach designed to enable sew to earn sufficient revenues to recover operating costs  capital expenditure and taxes and to generate a return on invested capital  while creating incentives for sew to operate efficiently 
as a result of this price determination mechanism and the fact that demand for water is relatively insensitive to economic conditions  sew s earnings are stable 
results of operations we acquired our initial businesses and investments on december and december  using the majority of the proceeds of our initial public offering 
as a consequence  our consolidated operating results for the year ended december  only reflect the results of operations of our businesses and investments for a nine day period between december  and december  any comparisons to our consolidated results of operations to prior periods would not be meaningful 
we have therefore included a comparison of the historical results of operations for each of our consolidated businesses  which we believe is a more appropriate approach to explaining the historical financial performance of the company 
the results of our businesses acquired during the year ended december  are included in our consolidated operating results from the date of acquisition 

table of contents our consolidated results of operations are summarized below in thousands april  year ended inception to december  december  revenues revenue from fuel sales service revenue financing and equipment lease income total revenue costs and expenses cost of fuel sales cost of services selling  general and administrative expenses fees to manager depreciation expense amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense dividend income interest income interest expense equity in earnings loss and amortization charges of investee other expense income  net net income loss before income taxes and minority interests income tax benefit net income loss before minority interests minority interests net income loss for the period from april  to december   we incurred a consolidated net loss of million as we had only nine days of operating results from our businesses and because of the million performance fee earned by our manager from the closing of our initial public offering until december  we incurred million of expenses related to the acquisitions of our businesses and organizational expenses 
we also earned million in dividend income from our investment in mcg  which was subsequently received in february for the year ended december   we earned consolidated net income of million 
our consolidated results included net income of million from our airport services business   from our district energy business  and a loss of million from our airport parking business 
our share of net income from the toll road business was million  net of non cash amortization expense of million and we also recognized  in other income 
we earned million including  of other income in dividend income from our investment in sew and million in dividend income from our investment in mcg 
we incurred selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses are million related to complying with the requirements under sarbanes oxley and million related to an unsuccessful acquisition bid 
we recorded million in base fees earned by our manager  pursuant to the terms of the management service agreement 

table of contents companies acquired in by mic  inc completed their tax returns during for the period prior to their acquisition 
an analysis of the net operating losses and other tax attributes that will carryforward to the us federal consolidated tax return of mic  inc and its subsidiaries from those returns  and an analysis of the need for a valuation allowance on the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets  resulted in a decrease in the consolidated valuation allowance of approximately million  million of which is included in net income 
we have included earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  on both a consolidated basis as well as for each segment 
we use ebitda to measure our ability to generate operating cash flow and to meet our distribution policy 
we generated million in ebitda for the year ended december  a reconciliation of ebitda is provided below in thousands april  year ended inception to december  december  net income loss interest expense  net income tax benefit depreciation amortization ebitda includes depreciation expense of million and  for the airport parking business for the year ended december  and the period december  our acquisition date through december   respectively

the airport parking business and district energy business include depreciation expense within cost of services in our consolidated statement of operations 
does not include amortization expense related to intangible assets in connection with our investment in the toll road business  of million and  for the year ended december  and the period december  our acquisition date through december   respectively 
airport services business in  the airport services business consisted of two reportable segments  atlantic and avports 
atlantic was owned under north america capital holding company  or nach 
avports was owned under macquarie airports north america inc  or mana 
these businesses are currently being integrated and managed as one business under nach 
therefore  they are now combined into a single reportable segment 
results for prior periods reflect the combined segment 
the financial performance for the year ended december  includes the operating results of general aviation holdings  llc or gah  from the acquisition date of january   and the operating results of eagle aviation resources  ltd  or ear  from the acquisition date of august  the financial performance for the year ended december  was obtained by combining the following results executive air support  inc  or eas  from january  through july   on which date eas was acquired by nach  nach from january  through december   when it was part of the macquarie group  
table of contents nach during the period of our ownership from december  to december   mana for the period january  through december   prior to our acquisition  and mana during the period of our ownership from december  to december  the financial performance for the year ended december  represents the combined results of operations of eas the predecessor of nach and mana 
the and results do not include the historical performance of gah or ear 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  key factors affecting operating results contribution of positive operating results from two new fbos in california gah acquired in january and one fbo in las vegas ear acquired in august  higher average dollar per gallon fuel margins at existing locations  continued increases in fuel prices  higher rental income from new hangars and increased tenant occupancy  no significant effect on our results from recent hurricanes  and higher first quarter de icing revenues at our northeast locations 
gah ear existing locations nach mana acquisitions total change change in thousands fuel revenue non fuel revenue total revenue cost of revenue fuel cost of revenue non fuel total cost of revenue fuel gross profit non fuel gross profit gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income other expense interest expense  net provision benefit for income taxes net income loss from continuing operations reconciliation of net income loss from continuing operations to ebitda from continuing operations net income loss from continuing operations interest expense  net provision benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda from continuing operations 
table of contents we have allocated a portion of nach interest expense to gah and ear on the basis of amortization expense of intangible assets  mainly airport contract rights  of gah and ear as a proportion of total nach intangible assets amortization expenses 
therefore  we recognize interest expense on ear even though we did not incur any additional senior debt at the time of our acquisition of ear 
revenue and gross profit most of our revenue and gross profit is generated through fueling general aviation aircraft at our fixed base operations around the united states 
this revenue is categorized according to who owns the fuel we use to service these aircraft 
if we own the fuel  we record our cost to purchase that fuel as cost of revenue fuel 
our corresponding fuel revenue is our cost to purchase that fuel plus a dollar based margin 
we generally pursue a strategy of maintaining  and where appropriate increasing  our margins  thereby passing any increase or decrease in fuel prices to the customer 
we also have into plane arrangements whereby we fuel aircraft with fuel owned by another party 
we collect a fee for this service that is recorded as non fuel revenue 
other non fuel revenue includes various services such as hangar rentals  de icing and terminal services 
cost of revenue non fuel includes our cost  if any  of providing these services 
the key factors generating our revenue and gross profit are fuel volume and dollar based margin per gallon 
this applies to both fuel and into plane revenue 
our customers will occasionally move from one category to the other 
therefore  we believe discussing our fuel and non fuel revenue and gross profit and the related key metrics on a combined basis provides the most meaningful analysis of our airport services business 
our total revenue and gross profit growth was due to several factors inclusion of the results of gah and ear from the respective dates of their acquisitions  rising cost of fuel  which we pass on to customers  to date we have not seen any material negative impact on demand for fuel due to the increases in fuel costs  an increase in dollar per gallon fuel margins at our existing locations  resulting largely from a higher proportion of higher margin customers  higher rental income due to new hangars that opened in and at our chicago and burlington locations respectively and higher occupancy of our existing locations  and increase in de icing revenue in the northeastern locations during first quarter of due to colder weather conditions 
our facilities at new orleans  la and gulfport  ms approximately million ebitda in were impacted by hurricane katrina 
some of our hangar and terminal facilities were damaged 
however  our results for the year were not significantly affected by this or any other recent hurricane 
we believe that we have an appropriate level of insurance coverage to repair or rebuild our facilities and to cover us for any business interruption we experience in the near term 
we anticipate that combined traffic at these facilities in may be lower than in as travel to new orleans and gulfport has slowed 
however  we believe that this will not have a significant effect on our overall results in or thereafter 
operating expenses the decrease in operating expenses at existing locations is due to non recurring transaction costs incurred by eas associated with the sale of the company in july this decrease was partially offset by increased professional fees and the implementation of a stock appreciation rights plan for certain employees at the former avports business 
the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the recording of nach s and mana s net assets to fair value upon their acquisitions  partially offset by the expiration in november of a two year non compete agreement 
on february   the board of nach approved the implementation and issuance of a stock appreciation rights program  or sars  to reward certain employees of the airport services business and to 
table of contents incentivize those employees to increase the long term value of that business 
the sars will vest over a five year period  with the majority of the vesting to occur by july the sars will be valued based upon the estimated fair market value of the airport services business as calculated by us 
the estimated value of the sars is million based on the december  valuation  assuming vesting at that date 
other expense the decrease in other expense in is primarily due to the recognition of expense attributable to outstanding warrants valued at approximately million that were subsequently cancelled in connection with the acquisition of atlantic by nach in july  prior to our acquisition of nach 
also included in results are  of costs associated with debt financing required to partially fund nach s acquisition of atlantic and million of bridge costs associated with our acquisition of nach 
in  nach incurred underwriting fees of  in relation to the acquisition of gah that were funded with proceeds from our ipo 
interest expense  net interest expense increased by million in over largely as a result of an increase in the level of debt  which was incurred at the time of our acquisition of gah  and as a result of the refinancing described below 
interest expense in includes the following items million of amortization of deferred financing costs  including million of deferred financing costs relating to the previously refinanced debt that was written off at the time of the refinancing  million gain on the recognition of the market value of interest rate swaps at the time of the refinancing  we have kept the swaps in place following the refinancing as outlined below  and  interest expense on subordinated debt  which we owned  that was converted to equity in june in december  we refinanced two existing debt facilities at our airport services business with a single debt facility 
this new debt facility provides an aggregate term loan borrowing of million and a million working capital facility 
the facility has a term of five years 
amounts borrowed under the facility bear interest at a margin of over libor for the first three years and a margin of over libor thereafter 
we have interest rate swap arrangements in place for of the aggregate term loan 
see liquidity and capital resources commitments and contingencies for more details on this refinancing 
since we have hedged of our interest rate exposure  our effective interest rate through is on the million loan facility 
ebitda the substantial increase in ebitda from existing locations is due to increased dollar fuel margins combined with a reduction in other expenses associated with the sale and financing of the acquisition of atlantic by nach of approximately million in july excluding these expenses ebitda at existing locations would have increased 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following section summarizes the historical consolidated financial performance of our airport services business for the years ended december  and key factors affecting operating results contribution of positive operating results from two fbos in new orleans acquired in december

our total revenue and gross profit growth million and million  respectively was due to several factors including increase due to acquisition in of two fbos in new orleans contributing million in revenue and million in gross profit  
table of contents rising cost of fuel  which we pass on to customers million of revenue increase  and an increase in the volume of fuel sold up on a same stores basis due to increased general aviation activity at most locations  increased volumes due to customer loyalty programs and increased military activity at louisville with aircraft returning from iraq and at gulfport with more military training 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative costs increased due to the addition of the two new orleans locations  including acquisition costs incurred by executive air support associated with the sale of the company in july and increased costs associated with the overall growth of the business 
the costs related to the sale of the company totaled approximately million in depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  reflecting the impact of purchase accounting on atlantic s asset valuations upon acquisition of atlantic by nach  offset by a slight reduction in avports depreciation and amortization expense due to the expiration in november of non compete agreements 
other expense other expense in consisted of the recognition of million in expense attributable to then outstanding warrants that were subsequently cancelled in connection with the acquisition of atlantic by nach and the costs associated with the bridge financing required to fund nach s acquisition of atlantic of million 
interest expense  net net interest expense increased by million due to an increase in the level of debt incurred after nach s acquisition of atlantic 
interest expense also includes million of interest payable on the subordinated debt of mana  which we own  and is eliminated upon consolidation 
ebitda the substantial decrease in ebitda is due to costs in associated with acquisitions approximately million 
excluding these non operating items  ebitda increased by approx million or  of which approximately million was due to the addition of the two new orleans fbos 
airport parking business in the following discussion  results of operations for and include results of mapc prior to our acquisition of the airport parking business on december  new locations refer to locations in operation during the year ended december  but not in operation throughout the corresponding period 
comparable locations refer to locations in operation throughout the years and for the year ended december   the new locations were buffalo  cleveland  columbus  houston  oklahoma city  philadelphia and st 
louis  acquired in the fourth quarter of  as well as  st 
louis  newark haynes avenue and oakland pardee  which were not in operation for the full year ended december  in addition  we relocated one facility in phoenix to a newly acquired property during the quarter ended december  this facility has been included in comparable locations totals for the year ended december  
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  key factors affecting operating results key factors influencing operating results were as follows an increase in cars out at comparable locations and the revenue contributed by the new locations resulted in a increase in revenue during the year ended december   reduced discounting and yield management of  for example  daily airport employee customers contributed to the slight increase in average parking revenue per car out for comparable locations during the year 
the impact of these initiatives was stronger in the second half of  and higher operating costs at comparable locations lowered operating margins while margins at new locations reflected less impact from start up costs than experienced in the prior year period and the positive contribution from the sunpark facilities acquired in the fourth quarter of change in thousands revenue direct expenses gross profit selling  general and administrative amortization of intangibles operating income interest expense  net other expense minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiaries net loss reconciliation of net loss to ebitda net loss interest expense  net depreciation amortization of intangibles ebitda includes depreciation expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents year ended december  operating data total revenues thousands new locations comparable locations comparable locations increase gross profit percentage new locations comparable locations parking revenues thousands new locations comparable locations comparable locations increase cars out new locations comparable locations comparable locations increase average parking revenue per car out new locations comparable locations comparable locations increase average overnight occupancy new locations comparable locations comparable locations increase locations new locations comparable locations total revenues include revenues from all sources  including but not limited to parking revenues 
parking revenues include all receipts from parking related revenue streams  which includes monthly  membership and receipts from third parties such as expedia and orbitz 
cars out refers to the total number of customers exiting during the period 
average overnight occupancy refers to aggregate average daily occupancy measured for all locations at the lowest point of the day  which does not reflect turnover and intra day activity 
revenue revenue increased with the addition of new locations in and growth at comparable locations 
revenue for included a cash settlement of  from an early contract termination 
the increase in cars out was primarily due to the new locations with cars out at comparable locations increasing by 
the increase in average parking revenue per car out was due to reduced levels of discounting  and price increases at certain locations  including those with daily airport employee customers 
parking revenues at comparable locations grew at a higher rate than total revenues 
this is due to the exclusion of contract revenue from parking revenue and  the impact of the cash settlement from an early contract termination received in total revenue growth of million included million from the six sunpark facilities acquired in the fourth quarter 

table of contents certain discounting and pricing strategies that had resulted in lower parking revenue per car out during the first half of the year were adjusted during the second half of these lower levels of discounting and higher prices in certain markets resulted in improved revenue per car out during the second half of and resulted in revenue per car out for being slightly higher than the period 
the business has experienced increased competition in several locations which may put short term pressure on pricing 
in  promotional and service efforts will be focused on these markets to address this increased competition 
seven of the new locations were acquired in the fourth quarter and contributed to the overall increase in revenue 
we are continuing to integrate these facilities including upgrade of the bus fleet and certain infrastructure scheduled for completion in the first and second quarters of in combination with staff training  improved customer service and integrated marketing  we expect the incremental benefits of integration will continue to be seen throughout although the number of cars using our facilities in increased over at the majority of our locations  our airport parking business as a whole has sufficient capacity to accommodate further growth 
at locations where we are operating at peak capacity intra day  we continue to evaluate our available options to expand capacity of these locations  including the use of additional overflow facilities and car lifts 
for example  in november  capacity was increased by approximately at one of our facilities with the installation of cars lifts 
at facilities where we are not capacity constrained we also aim to grow revenues through increased pricing or reduced discounting 
operating expenses direct expenses for the year ended december  increased mainly by the additional costs associated with operating new locations 
the increase totaled million 
direct expenses include non cash rent in excess of lease in the amount of million and  for the years and  respectively 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  we recognize the total rent expense to be paid over the life of a lease on a straight line basis 
this generally results in rent expense higher than actual cash paid early in the lease and rent expense lower than actual cash paid later in the lease 
other factors affecting direct expenses at comparable locations are higher shuttle operating costs in the second half of due to the increased cost of fuel  higher rents related to new long term lease agreements that were secured in the fourth quarter and rental payments resulting from use of overflow lots in locations with capacity constraints  higher damaged car claims and  in response  higher security costs  higher advertising expenses reflecting a radio campaign during the fourth quarter  and lower selling  general and administrative expenses resulting from lower severance costs and performance bonuses  offset in part by higher professional fees and strategic planning initiatives 
on february   the board of mapc approved the implementation and issuance of a stock appreciation rights program  or sars  to reward certain key employees of the airport parking business and to incentivize those employees to increase the long term value of that business 
the sars will vest over a five year period  with the majority of the vesting to occur by july the sars will be valued based upon the estimated fair market value of the airport services business as calculated by us 
the estimated value of the sars is  based on the december  valuation  assuming vesting at that date 
amortization of intangibles amortization increased largely as a result of the increase in the fair value of the assets acquired when mapc was purchased by us on december  and the fair value of assets acquired in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by the accelerated amortization of customer contracts that expired in 
table of contents interest expense  net interest expense in increased due to higher libor rates  partially offset by the elimination of deferred finance cost amortization resulting from our initial acquisition  and increases in our overall level of debt as a result of the acquisition the sunpark facilities and a facility in philadelphia 
we have an interest rate cap agreement at a base rate of libor equal to for a notional amount of million for the term of the loan and a second interest rate cap agreement at a base rate of libor equal to for a notional amount of million 
both interest rate caps were reached in the first quarter of ebitda excluding the aforementioned non cash deferred rent and the contract settlement in  ebitda would have increased by in the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
new locations generated a gross profit margin of for the year ended december  compared to for the nine months to september  this reflects the positive impact of the sunpark acquisition in the fourth quarter

table of contents revenue revenue in the year ended december  was higher than in the year ended december  mainly due to the acquisition of the assets of the avistar parking business on october  avistar contributed million of the total revenue increase in of million 
revenue from the comparable sites increased by and was primarily due to new marketing initiatives  an overall increase in air passenger traffic at airports at which the business operates  the conversion to public parking of one of our facilities in june that was previously contracted to a company for employee parking  and additional capacity from temporary overflow locations 
average daily overnight occupancy increased from approximately  vehicles in to approximately  vehicles in  mainly due to the acquisition of avistar  vehicles and growth at comparable locations of 
operating expenses direct expenses increased by million mainly due to the acquisition of the avistar parking business  which contributed million to the increase 
the other factors affecting direct expenses include start up costs of million for the four new locations opened during additional operating expenses resulting from the conversion of the parking lot described above  and increase in staffing and shuttle bus expense to support higher occupancy levels  and higher selling  general and administrative expenses due to the payment of a termination fee upon cancellation of the management contract with the previous owner and severance costs of  amortization of intangibles amortization decreased largely as a result of an impairment loss in the amount of million related to certain contract rights which was recorded in  but offset by an increase in amortization of the assets purchased in the avistar transaction which were recorded for the full year in interest expense interest expense in included million of deferred finance cost amortization  which decreased from million in this is due to million in debt issuance costs which were written off on october  in conjunction with the debt refinancing and with the new debt raised to finance the acquisition of the avistar assets 
ebitda ebitda increased in the months ended december  compared to the prior year period  mostly due to the full year effect of the avistar acquisition

we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different conditions 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
these policies are consistent with the accounting policies followed by the businesses we own 
business combinations our acquisitions of businesses that we control are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  recorded as goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of acquired entities and other relevant information 
such information includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts for significant business combinations 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values require significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
goodwill  intangible assets and property  plant and equipment significant assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of the airport services business  airport parking business and district energy business include contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements  trademarks  domain names  property and equipment and goodwill 
trademarks and domain names are generally considered to be indefinite life intangibles 
trademarks  domain names and goodwill are not amortized in most circumstances 
it may be appropriate to amortize some trademarks and domain names 
however  for unamortized intangible assets  we are required to perform annual impairment reviews and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts and comparing those estimated fair values with the carrying values  which included the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 
the airport services business  airport parking business and district energy business are separate reporting units for purposes of 
table of contents this analysis 
the impairment test for trademarks and domain names which are not amortized requires the determination of the fair value of such assets 
if the fair value of the trademarks and domain names is less than their carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and or intangible assets 
such events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or material negative change in relationship with significant customers 
property and equipment are initially stated at cost 
depreciation on property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
our estimated useful lives represent the period the asset remains in services assuming normal routine maintenance 
we review the estimated useful lives assigned to property and equipment when our business experience suggests that they do not properly reflect the consumption of economic benefits embodied in the property and equipment nor result in the appropriate matching of cost against revenue 
factors that lead to such a conclusion may include physical observation of asset usage  examination of realized gains and losses on asset disposals and consideration of market trends such as technological obsolescence or change in market demand 
significant intangibles  including contract rights  customer relationships  non compete agreements and technology are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset after consideration of historical results and anticipated results based on our current plans 
with respect to contract rights in our airport services business  we take into consideration the history of contract right renewals in determining our assessment of useful life and the corresponding amortization period 
we perform impairment reviews of property and equipment and intangibles subject to amortization  when events or circumstances indicate that assets are less than their carrying amount and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets 
in this circumstance  the impairment charge is determined based upon the amount of the net book value of the assets exceeds their fair market value 
any impairment is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of reporting units and fair value of property and equipment and intangible assets is determined by our management and is generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
we use outside valuation experts when management considers that it is appropriate to do so 
the carrying value of our equity method investment includes an additional intangible asset to reflect the difference between the purchase price for our investment in the toll road business and the underlying equity in the net assets of the business 
this intangible asset value  which represents the concession agreement with the secretary of state for transport in the united kingdom the concession agreement has been recorded at fair value determined by management  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of acquired entities and other relevant information including valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts 
the concession agreement is amortized based on a percentage of usage of the toll road in the period relative to the total estimated usage over the life of the agreement 
in addition  any loss in value that is other than temporary is recognized as an impairment charge 
we test goodwill for impairment as of october each year 
there was no goodwill impairment as of october  we test our long lived assets when there is an indicator of impairment 
there were no impairments of long lived assets during securities available for sale our acquisition of mcg was initially recorded at cost and classified as a security available for sale on our consolidated balance sheet 
our intention is to hold mcg for an indeterminate period of time 
since 
table of contents mcg has a readily determinable market value  we record this investment at cost with unrealized gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income loss 
declines in value other than temporary are included in investment income 
management consider mcg s financial position  results of operations  stock price performance  analyst research reports and other relevant information in determining whether a decline is other than temporary 
we revaluate our hold position on an annual basis 
investments at cost our initial investment in sew was recorded at cost 
as sew does not have a readily determinable market value  we continue to record the investment at cost 
we perform periodic review of the investment  using information supplied by the management of sew 
we further evaluate sew based on the future cash flow projections  discounted to present value 
we use outside valuation experts when we consider it appropriate to do so 
revenue recognition fuel revenue from our airport services business is recorded when fuel is provided or when services are rendered 
our airport services business also records hangar rental fees  which are recognized during the month for which service is provided
