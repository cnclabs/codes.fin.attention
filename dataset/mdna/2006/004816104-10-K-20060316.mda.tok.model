critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
however  certain accounting estimates are particularly important to the understanding of the company s financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by the company s management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside the control of management 
the company s management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on historical operations  future business plans and projected financial results  the terms of existing contracts  the observance of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the following discusses the company s critical accounting policies and estimates 
estimates 
operating results may be affected by certain accounting estimates 
the most sensitive and significant accounting estimates in the financial statements relate to customer rebates  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  obsolete and slow moving inventories  potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  and accruals for income taxes 
accruals for customer rebates are based on executed contracts and anticipated sales levels  which are monitored monthly 
management critically evaluates the potential realization of deferred income tax benefits as well as the likely usefulness of inventories and the collectability of accounts receivable 
accruals for income taxes or benefits often require interpretations of complex tax rules and regulations  which may be subsequently challenged 
although the company s management has used available information to make judgments on the appropriate estimates to record for the above matters  there can be no assurance that future events will not significantly affect the estimated amounts related to these areas where estimates are required

ownership generally transfers from the company to its customer upon shipment of the company s products 
when right of return exists  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sfas  revenue recognition when right of return exists 
intangible assets

deferred financing costs are amortized over the term of the related debt 
patents and trademarks are amortized over their estimated useful life 
the weighted average amortization period of intangible assets at december  is years 
the company reviews the value recorded for intangibles to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows 
impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent the carrying value exceeds fair value determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
the projection of future cash flows requires the company to make estimates about the amount of future revenues 
the actual future results could differ significantly from these estimates  and resulting changes in the estimates of future cash flows could be significant and could affect the recoverability of intangible assets 
during  the company s net book value of intangible assets increased from  to  accounting for stock based compensation

recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised statement r  share based payment  which revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the revised statement addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and other third parties  eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using apb and requires that the compensation costs relating to such transactions be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
acme will adopt the provisions of the statement effective january  as required 
the impact of adoption of statement r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had acme adopted statement in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income loss and net income loss per share in the stock based compensation accounting policy note included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage should be recognized as current period charges  and that fixed production overheads should be allocated to inventory based on normal capacity of production facilities 
this statement is effective for acme s fiscal year we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk the company s debt portfolio and associated interest rates follow dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value long term debt including current portion amount at fixed rate average interest rate amount at variable rate    average interest rate interest rate risk the company s interest expense on debt is most sensitive to changes in the level of united states interest rates 
to mitigate the impact of these fluctuations  the company periodically evaluates alternative interest rate arrangements 
foreign currency risk the company s currency exposures vary  but are concentrated in the canadian dollar  british pound  and euro 
purchases of inventory by the hong kong office are in us dollars 
at times  the company utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge specific transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies 
the terms of these forward foreign exchange contracts are typically days to a year 
because the contracts are acquired for specific transactions  they are an effective hedge against fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency underlying the transaction 
the company s canadian subsidiary had entered into a forward foreign exchange contract to reduce the risk of inventory purchases in a currency other than its functional currency  the canadian dollar 
the company hedged the risk of foreign currency fluctuations for approximately million of inventory purchases in by the canadian subsidiary 
the foreign exchange contract expired at december  adjustments to the fair value were reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
the company and its foreign subsidiaries utilize bank loans to finance their operations 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  foreign loans are denominated in the local currency of the foreign subsidiary wherever possible 
inflation inflation had a negligible effect on the company s operations during and the company estimates that any inflationary effects  in the aggregate  were generally recovered or offset through increased pricing or cost reductions in both years
