item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements 
in some cases these statements are identifiable through the use of words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  plan  project  target  can  could  may  should  will  would and similar expressions 
you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements we make are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various assumptions  risks  and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  those set forth below and in the other documents that we file with the sec 
there also are other factors that we may not describe  generally because we currently do not perceive them to be material  which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as required by law 
following is a discussion of some of the more significant risks that could materially impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents any change in the level of economic activity in north america and europe  our major geographical markets  may have an impact on the level of demand for our products and our resulting revenue and earnings 
the demand for many of our products is economically sensitive and will vary with general economic activity  trends in nonresidential construction  investment in manufacturing facilities and automation  demand for information technology equipment  and other economic factors 
changes in the price and availability of raw materials we use could be detrimental to our profitability 
copper is a significant component of the cost of most of our products 
during the past two years  the price of copper has risen rapidly 
other materials we use  such as pvc and other plastics derived from petrochemical feedstocks  have also risen in price 
generally  we have recovered much of the higher cost of raw materials through higher pricing of our finished products 
the majority of our products are sold through distribution  and we manage the pricing of these products through published price lists which we update from time to time  with new prices taking effect a few weeks after they are announced 
some oem and telecom customer contracts have provisions for passing through raw material cost increases  generally with a lag of a few weeks to three months 
we have been generally more successful in north america than in europe and in electronic products than in networking products in increasing our prices to recapture the rising cost of materials 
if we are unable to raise prices sufficiently to recover our material costs  our earnings will be reduced 
if we raise our prices but competitors raise their prices less  we may lose sales  and our earnings will be reduced 
we believe the supply of raw materials copper  plastics  and other materials is adequate and we do not expect any substantial interruption of supply or shortage of materials 
if such a supply interruption or shortage were to occur  however  this could have a negative effect on revenue and earnings 
the global wire and cable industry is highly competitive 
we compete with other manufacturers of cable  wire  connectivity and related products based in north america  europe and asia 
these companies compete on price  reputation and quality  product characteristics  and terms 
actions that may be taken by competitors  including pricing  business alliances  new product introductions  and other actions  could have a negative effect on our revenue and profitability 
we rely on key suppliers  and we source some of our products from other manufacturers 
there are only a few suppliers in the world for fep  a polymer also known by the dupont trade name teflon 
fep is an important material in the manufacture of much of our data networking cable sold in north america 
we believe the supply of fep is adequate and will remain adequate in the future 
if we were unable to obtain a sufficient supply of fep  we might not be able to produce enough of certain products to meet demand  and our sales and profitability would be affected negatively 
in addition  we might find it necessary to pay higher prices for scarce material and raise our product prices to compensate for higher material cost  a situation in which our price increases might lag our cost increases and depress our gross margins 
belden cdt sources a minor percentage of its finished products from a network of manufacturers under private label agreements 
we depend on these manufacturers to supply high quality products in a timely manner 
if there were problems with the quality or delivery of these private label goods  our sales and profits would be negatively affected 
we rely on several key distributors in marketing our product 
the majority of our sales are through distributors 
these distributors carry the products of competitors along with our products 
our largest distributor customer  anixter international inc  accounted for percent of our revenue in if we were to lose a key distributor  our revenue and profits would likely be reduced  at least temporarily 
in the past  we have sometimes seen distributors acquired and consolidated 
if there were further consolidation of the electronics and cable distributors  this could have an effect on our relationships with these distributors 
it 
table of contents could also result in consolidation of distributor inventory  which would temporarily depress our revenue 
we have also experienced financial failure of distributors from time to time  resulting in our inability to collect accounts receivable in full 
because we do business in many countries  our results of operations are affected by changes in currency exchange rates 
other than the united states dollar  the principal currencies to which we are exposed through our manufacturing operations and sales are the euro  the canadian dollar and the british pound 
most of our products sold in europe are manufactured there  resulting in a natural hedge  to some degree 
most of our products sold in asia are priced in us dollars 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  the results of our non us operations are translated at a lower exchange rate and thus into lower reported earnings 
our effective income tax rate may vary from year to year because of the mix of income and losses among various tax jurisdictions in which we do business 
our effective income tax rate is the result of the income tax rates in the various countries in which we do business 
our mix of income and losses in these jurisdictions determines our effective tax rate 
more income in higher tax rate jurisdictions or more losses in lower tax rate jurisdictions would increase our effective tax rate and thus lower our net income 
if we generate losses in tax jurisdictions for which no benefits are available  our effective income tax rate will increase 
we might be unable to achieve planned cost savings 
the plans for our business include both revenue improvement and cost saving initiatives 
for example  the company has announced a restructuring program for its european operations 
the restructuring program is expected to reduce manufacturing costs in europe 
if we do not achieve all the planned savings  we might not achieve expected levels of profitability 
we may incur costs related to warranty  product liability lawsuits  or other lawsuits or claims that may be brought against us 
some of our products are warranted for years 
we have a reserve for expected warranty costs  but if actual costs are higher than expected  the excess costs will be recognized in future periods  reducing our income 
our products could be subject to product liability claims and litigation 
if our products are not properly designed and manufactured  personal injuries  death  or property damage could result 
the costs associated with defending product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial 
please see part i  item of this annual report on form k  for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which we are involved 
we are subject to current environmental and other laws and regulations 
we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we do business 
we are currently  and may in the future be  held responsible for remedial investigations and clean up costs of certain sites damaged by the discharge of hazardous substances  including sites that have never been owned or operated by us but at which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws 
changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 
if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired  we may be required to recognize charges that would reduce our income 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized but must be reviewed for possible impairment annually  or more often in certain circumstances if events indicate that the asset values are not recoverable 
we have incurred charges in the past 
table of contents for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  and we may be required to do so again in future periods 
such a charge would reduce our income without any change to our underlying cash flow 
changes in accounting rules and interpretation of these rules may affect our reported earnings 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are complex and require interpretation 
these principles change from time to time  and such changes may result in changes to our reported income without any change in our underlying cash flow 
our business is subject to the political and economic uncertainties of making and selling our products abroad 
a significant proportion of our sales are outside the united states 
we have manufacturing facilities in canada  mexico and in several european countries 
we rely on suppliers in many countries  including china 
the company s foreign operations are subject to economic and political risks inherent in maintaining operations abroad such as economic and political destabilization  international conflicts  restrictive actions by foreign governments  and adverse foreign tax laws 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
our products are used in connection with technologies of many kinds 
our markets are characterized by the introduction of increasingly capable products 
we have long been successful in introducing successive generations of more capable products  but if we were to fail to keep pace with technology or with the products of competitors  we might lose market share and harm our reputation and position as a technology leader in our markets 
competing technologies could cause the obsolescence of many of our products 
fiber optic technology presents a potential substitute for certain of the copper based products that comprise the majority of our sales 
fiber optic cables have significant advantages over copper based cables in applications where large amounts of information must travel great distances 
but due to the high relative cost required to interface electronic and light signals and the high cost of fiber termination and connection  we believe that copper cable is still the solution with the best combination of performance and cost for all but the trunk and riser portions of data networks and similar applications 
we produce and market multimode fiber optic cables and many customers specify these products in combination with copper cables 
advances in copper cable technologies and data transmission equipment have increased the relative performance of copper solutions 
the final stage of most networks remains almost exclusively copper based and we expect that it will continue to be copper for the foreseeable future 
however  if there were a significant and rapid decrease in the cost of fiber optic systems relative to the cost of copper based systems  without a further significant increase in copper capabilities  such systems could become superior on a price performance basis to copper systems 
we do not control our own source of optical fiber production and  although we cable optical fiber  we could be at a cost disadvantage to competitors who both produce and cable optical fiber 
to date  the development of wireless devices has required the development of new wired platforms and infrastructure 
in the future  wireless communications technology may represent a threat to both copper and fiber optic based systems 
we believe that the insufficient signal security  susceptibility to interference and jamming  and relatively slow transmission speeds of current systems restrict the use of wireless technology in many data communications markets 
however  there are no assurances that future advances in wireless technology will not have an adverse effect on our business 
we have defined benefit pension plans that are not fully funded 
we have defined benefit pension plans in the united states  canada and the united kingdom 
the cash funding requirements for these plans depends on the financial performance of the funds assets  actuarial life expectancies  discount rates and other factors 
the fair value of the assets in the plans is often less that the projected benefit owed 
table of contents by the company 
in most years we are required to contribute cash to fund the pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans  and the amount of funding required may vary significantly 
some of our employees are members of collective bargaining groups  and we might be subject to labor actions that would interrupt our business 
some of our employees  primarily outside the united states  are members of collective bargaining units 
we believe that the company s relations with employees are generally good 
however  if there were a dispute with one of these bargaining units  the affected operations could be interrupted resulting in lost revenues  lost profit contribution  and customer dissatisfaction 
we might have difficulty protecting our intellectual property from use by competitors  or competitors might accuse us of violating their intellectual property rights 
disagreements about patents and intellectual property rights occur in our industry 
sometimes these disagreements are settled through an agreement for one party to pay royalties to another 
the unfavorable resolution of an intellectual property dispute could preclude us from manufacturing and selling certain products  could require us to pay a royalty on the sale of certain products  or could impair our competitive advantage if a competitor wins the right to sell products we believe we invented 
intellectual property disputes could result in legal fees and other costs 
we announced a decision to exit the communications cable market in the united kingdom  which will reduce our revenue and income 
in september we announced plans to exit the telecommunications cable market in the united kingdom upon the expiration of our contract with british telecom plc in october or sooner  if possible 
in connection with this decision  we expect to sell or liquidate a business that had approximately million of revenue in  and we expect to retain little or none of that revenue 
the business generated operating profit we will no longer recognize 
while we expect that the sale or liquidation of the business will generate cash in excess of the cash required to exit the business  the timing and nature of our exit from this business could negatively impact our earnings 
we have in the past closed plants and reduced the size of our workforce  and we might need to do so again in the future 
much of our manufacturing capacity is in north america and western europe  which are relatively high cost regions 
over the past few years  we have closed several plants and have reduced the number of people we employ 
we incurred asset impairment charges  severance charges and other costs in relation to these plant closures 
if we decide to close additional facilities  we could incur significant cash and non cash charges in connection with these actions 
this list of risk factors is not exhaustive 
other considerations besides those mentioned above might cause our actual results to differ from expectations expressed in any forward looking statement

the company believes its physical facilities are suitable for their present and intended purposes and adequate for the company s current level of operations 

table of contents item legal proceedings the company is a party to various legal proceedings and administrative actions that are incidental to its operations 
these proceedings include personal injury cases about of which the company was aware at february  in which the company is one of many defendants  of which are scheduled for trial during electricians have filed a majority of these cases  primarily in new jersey and pennsylvania 
plaintiffs in these cases generally seek compensatory  special and punitive damages 
as of february   in of these cases  plaintiffs generally allege only damages in excess of some dollar amount ie  in one case  not less than thousand and in the other cases  in excess of thousand in compensatory damages and thousand in punitive damages 
in of these cases  plaintiffs generally do not allege a specific monetary damage demand 
as to each of the other cases  the plaintiffs generally allege million in compensatory and million in punitive damages 
in none of these cases do plaintiffs allege claims for specific dollar amounts as to any defendant 
based on the company s experience in such litigation  the amounts pleaded in the complaints are not typically meaningful as an indicator of the company s ultimate liability 
typically in these cases  the claimant alleges injury from alleged exposure to heat resistant asbestos fiber  which was usually encapsulated or embedded and lacquer coated or covered by another material 
exposure to the fiber generally would have occurred  if at all  while stripping cutting the wire or cable that had such fiber 
it is alleged by claimants that exposure to the fiber may result in respiratory illness 
generally  stripping was done to repair or to attach a connector to the wire or cable 
alleged predecessors of the company had a small number of products that contained the fiber  but ceased production of such products more than fifteen years ago 
through february   the company had been dismissed or reached agreement to be dismissed in approximately similar cases without any going to trial  and with only of these involving any payment to the claimant 
some of these cases were dismissed without prejudice primarily because the claimants could not show any injury  or could not show that injury was caused from exposure to products of alleged predecessors of the company 
the company has insurance that it believes should cover a significant portion of any defense or settlement costs borne by the company in these types of cases 
the company vigorously defends these cases 
as a separate matter  liability for any such injury generally should be allocated among all defendants in such cases in accordance with applicable law 
in the opinion of the company s management  the proceedings and actions in which the company is involved should not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial condition

table of contents other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily derived from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual amounts will not differ from those estimates

overview belden cdt designs  manufactures and markets high speed electronic cables  connectivity products and related items for the specialty electronics and data networking markets 
we focus on segments of the worldwide cable and connectivity market that require highly differentiated  high performance products 
we add value through design  engineering  excellence in manufacturing  product quality  and customer service 
we believe that revenue growth  operating margins and operating working capital management are our key performance indicators 
during the five year period from through  our total revenues increased by from million to  million 
this revenue comparison reflects two offsetting trends from through  companies selling products to the electronics and networking markets suffered through a significant downturn in demand 
much of this downturn could be attributed to the poor health of the general economies in both north america and europe during that period 
a majority of our revenues historically were derived from customers located in those regions 
we experienced increased demand for our products in and as the general economies of those two regions began to improve 
in and  incremental revenues of million were generated because of the belden cdt merger discussed below 
during the five year period from through  our operating income increased from million to million 
this increase is attributable to several factors  including the following in and  incremental operating income was generated because of the belden cdt merger discussed below 
as noted above  companies selling products to the electronics and networking markets suffered through a significant downturn in demand because of the poor health of the north american and european economies during through although we responded to the decreased demand with manufacturing and sg a cost reductions  we were unable to reduce costs to a level or at a velocity to completely offset the negative effect of reduced sales volume on operating income 
in  we elected to exit the united kingdom communications cable market and restructure our european manufacturing operations 
as a result of these decisions  we recognized impairment  severance and other restructuring costs 
further discussion regarding these activities is included in european operations below 
in and  the cost of many of our most used raw materials  including copper and commodities derived from petrochemical feedstocks  increased dramatically 
we have increased sales prices across most of our product lines in an effort to recover much of the higher cost of these raw materials 
we have been generally more successful in north america than in europe and in electronic products than in networking products in increasing our prices to recapture the rising cost of materials 
in those markets where we have been less successful at increasing sales prices to recapture the rising cost of materials  operating income was adversely affected 
further discussion regarding rising material costs and our response to them is included in effects of inflation below 

table of contents we define operating working capital as receivables and inventories less accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
during the five year period from through  our operating working capital increased from million to million 
this increase is attributable to several factors  including the following in  additional operating working capital of million was acquired through the belden cdt merger discussed below 
in and  the cost of many of our most used raw materials  including copper and commodities derived from petrochemical feedstocks  increased dramatically 
we have increased sales prices across most of our product lines in an effort to recover much of the higher cost of these raw materials 
the rise in materials costs and our increased sales prices have resulted in higher inventory and receivable positions 
the adverse effect of these higher asset positions on operating working capital was partially offset by a higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities position also resulting primarily from rising raw material costs 
over the past few years  we have closed several manufacturing facilities and have reduced the number of people we employ 
we incurred asset impairment charges  severance charges and other costs in relation to these plant closures 
if we decide to close additional facilities  we could incur significant cash and non cash charges in connection with these actions 
belden cdt merger belden inc belden and cable design technologies corporation cdt entered into an agreement and plan of merger  dated february  the merger agreement pursuant to which belden merged with and became a wholly owned subsidiary of cdt the merger on july  pursuant to the merger agreement  million shares of belden common stock  par value 
per share  were exchanged for million shares of cdt common stock  par value 
per share  and cdt changed its name to belden cdt inc belden and cdt each believed the merger was in the best interests of its respective stockholders because  as a result of the merger  the long term value of an investment in the combined company would likely be superior to the long term value of an investment in either standalone company 
in deciding to consummate the merger  belden and cdt considered various factors  some of which are listed in note  belden cdt merger  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the merger included the following significant related transactions cdt effected a one for two reverse split of its common stock immediately prior to the merger  belden cancelled approximately million shares of its common stock held in treasury on july   and we granted retention and integration awards to certain of our executive officers and other key employees totaling million to be paid in cash and restricted stock distributed in three installments over two years 
we recognized million and million of asset impairment  restructuring and incentive compensation expenses in and  respectively  related to the merger 
as of the merger consummation date  we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
on that date  the former cdt stockholders and former belden stockholders respectively owned approximately and of the company 
the merger was treated as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
belden was considered the acquiring enterprise for financial reporting purposes because belden s owners as a group retained or received the larger portion of the voting rights in the company and belden s senior management represented a majority of the senior management of the company 
the cost to acquire cdt was million and consisted of the exchange of common stock discussed above  change of control costs for legacy cdt management and costs incurred by belden related directly to the acquisition 
the purchase price was established primarily through the negotiation of the share exchange ratio 
the share exchange ratio was intended to value both belden and cdt fairly so that neither company paid a premium 
table of contents over equity market value for the other 
we established a new accounting basis for the assets and liabilities of cdt based upon the fair values thereof as of the merger date 
the company recognized goodwill related to the merger in the amount of million 
for financial reporting purposes  the results of operations of cdt are included in our consolidated statements of operations from july  the fair values assigned to each major asset and liability caption of cdt as of the july  effective date of the merger and unaudited pro forma summary financial results presenting selected operating information for the company as if the merger and the one for two reverse stock split had been completed as of january  and are included in note  belden cdt merger  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
european operations in the second quarter of  british telecom plc requested bids from both the company and several other suppliers on a supply agreement currently awarded to the company 
this business provided reasonably satisfactory profit contribution in the past  but we viewed the communications cable market as extremely mature  with falling demand  excess capacity  and continuing price pressure 
on september   we announced our decisions to exit the united kingdom communications cable market and restructure our european operations in an effort to reduce manufacturing floor space and overhead and streamline administrative processes 
we are actively exploring alternatives for disposition of the manchester  united kingdom operation 
if unable to arrange a sale of the business at an acceptable price  we plan to liquidate the business 
as a result of these decisions  we recognized asset impairment expense of million and severance expense of million during we expect to recognize additional severance expense of at least million and other restructuring costs and associated expenses of million during  however  the amount of severance expense recognized could increase should we elect to liquidate the manchester  united kingdom business 
we may also recognize additional asset impairment expenses or losses on the disposal of assets during both the exit from the united kingdom communications cable market and the european restructuring 
effects of inflation the principal raw material we use in many of our products is copper 
we also purchase teflon fluoropolymers  pvc  polyethylene  color chips and insulating materials such as plastic and rubber in large quantities 
during and  the price of copper has risen rapidly 
materials such as pvc and other plastics derived from petrochemical feedstocks have also risen in price 
generally  we have recovered much of the higher cost of raw materials through higher pricing of our finished products 
the majority of our products are sold through distribution  and we manage the pricing of these products through published price lists which we update from time to time  with new prices taking effect a few weeks after they are announced 
some oem and telecommunications customer contracts have provisions which allow us to pass on raw material cost increases  generally with a lag of a few weeks to three months 
we have been generally more successful in north america than in europe and with our electronic products rather than our networking products in increasing our prices to recapture the rising cost of materials

the notes bear interest at the contractual rates of   and  respectively  and mature in september  september  and september  respectively 
the agreements for these notes contain various customary affirmative and negative covenants and other provisions  including restrictions on the incurrence of debt  maintenance of a maximum leverage ratio and minimum net worth 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  we repaid the million tranche of the placement in september at december   we had outstanding million of unsecured subordinated debentures 
the debentures are convertible into shares of common stock  at a conversion price of per share  upon the occurrence of certain events 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment for dividends and other equity transactions 
holders may surrender their debentures for conversion upon satisfaction of any of the following conditions the closing sale price of our common stock is at least of the conversion price for a minimum of days in the trading day period ending on the trading day prior to surrender  the senior implied rating assigned to the company by moody s investors service  inc is downgraded to b or below and the corporate credit rating assigned to the company by standard poor s is downgraded to b or below  we have called the debentures for redemption  or upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions as specified in the indenture 
as of december   condition had been met  but condition had not been met as the senior implied rating was ba and the corporate credit rating was bb 
interest of is payable semiannually in arrears  on january and july the debentures mature on july   if not previously redeemed 
we may redeem some or all of the debentures on or after july   at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date 
holders may require us to purchase all or part of their debentures on july   july   or july   at a price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures plus accrued and unpaid interest up to the redemption date  in which case the purchase price may be paid in cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and our common stock  at our option 
we entered into a credit agreement with a group of six banks on october  credit agreement 
the credit agreement provided for a secured  variable rate and revolving credit facility not to exceed million expiring in june in general  a portion of our assets in the united states  other than real property  secured any borrowing under the credit agreement 
the amount of any such borrowing was subject to a borrowing base comprised of a portion of our receivables and inventories located in the united states 
a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant became applicable if the sum of our excess borrowing availability and unrestricted cash fell below 
table of contents million 
there were no outstanding borrowings at december  under the credit agreement 
we had million in borrowing capacity available at december  on january   we entered into a new million credit facility with a group of eight banks  expandable to million and secured by our overall cash flow and our assets in the united states 
the new facility replaces the million facility discussed above 
we also had unsecured  uncommitted arrangements with nine banks under which we may borrow up to million at prevailing interest rates 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under these arrangements 
we will sometimes manage our debt portfolio by using interest rate swap agreements to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates 
during  we were party to interest rate swap agreements relating to our medium term notes that matured in september the swaps converted a notional amount of million from fixed rates to floating rates and also matured in september these agreements were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of the associated medium term notes 
credit and market risk exposures on these agreements were limited to the net interest differentials 
net interest differentials earned from the interest rate swaps of million pretax  or 
per diluted share  were recorded as a reduction to interest expense for net interest differentials earned from the interest rate swaps reduced our average interest rate on long term debt by percentage points for we had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december  or during the year then ended 
stockholders equity decreased by million  or  from to because of an increase in treasury stock as well as deterioration in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in retained earnings and additional paid in capital as well as a decrease in unearned deferred compensation 
treasury stock increased by million because of shares purchased during the year under our share repurchase program and the forfeiture of stock by our incentive plan participants in lieu of cash payment of individual tax liabilities related to share based compensation 
accumulated other comprehensive income decreased by million primarily because of the negative effect of currency exchange rates on financial statement translation 
retained earnings increased million primarily because of net income of million partially offset by dividends of million 
additional paid in capital increased by million primarily as the result of stock option exercises 
unearned deferred compensation decreased million primarily because of current year amortization of compensation related to restricted stock awards 
off balance sheet arrangements we were not a party to any of the following types of off balance sheet arrangements at december  guarantee contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to the guaranteed or indemnified party based on changes in an underlying asset  liability or equity security of the guaranteed or indemnified party  guarantee contracts that contingently require us to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity s failure to perform under an obligating agreement  indirect guarantees under agreements that contingently require us to transfer funds to the guaranteed party upon the occurrence of specified events under conditions whereby the funds become legally available to creditors of the guaranteed party and those creditors may enforce the guaranteed party s claims against us under the agreement  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  derivative instruments that are indexed to our common or preferred stock and classified as stockholders equity under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or

environmental remediation we are subject to numerous federal  state  provincial  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage  handling  emission and discharge of materials into the environment  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla  the clean water act  the clean air act  the emergency planning and community right to know act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
we believe our existing environmental control procedures are adequate and we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area 
a former belden cdt facility in shrewsbury  massachusetts was sold to a third party in  subject to an indemnification in favor of the buyer for certain preexisting environmental liabilities  principally caused by a former owner 
contaminated soil has been removed  and groundwater remediation has been suspended 
site closure documents have been submitted to the state environmental agency for review and approval 
we will close the groundwater system upon approval of the closure application by the state agency 
our facility in venlo  the netherlands was acquired in from philips electronics nv soil and groundwater contamination was identified on the site as a result of material handling and past storage practices 
various soil and groundwater assessments are being performed  and the government authorities have advised that some form of remediation will be necessary 
we have recorded a liability for the estimated costs 
in addition  we may need to make capital expenditures to install groundwater treatment equipment  however  we do not expect such capital expenditures to materially affect our financial position  operating results or cash flows 
we are named as a defendant in the city of lodi  california s federal lawsuit along with over other defendants 
the complaint  brought under federal  state and local statutory provisions  alleges that property previously owned by our predecessor contributed to groundwater pollution in lodi 
there has been no validation or investigation to demonstrate or deny the city s claim that the property allegedly owned by our predecessor is a potential pollution site 
an investigation in the area is currently being planned  with a trial date tentatively scheduled to begin in january we have recorded a liability for the estimated costs related to resolution of the matter 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to two sites designated for cleanup under cercla or similar state laws  which impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages without regard to fault or the legality of waste generation or disposal 
persons liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites 
although cercla imposes joint and several liability on all prps  in application  the prps typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon the volume of waste contributed by each prp 
settlements can often be achieved through negotiations with the appropriate environmental agency or the other prps 
prps that contributed less than of the waste are often given the opportunity to settle as de minimis parties  resolving their liability for a particular site 
the number of sites with respect to which we have been identified as a prp has decreased in part as a result of de minimis settlements 
belden cdt does not own or operate either waste site with respect to which it has been identified as a prp 
in each case  we are identified as a party that disposed of waste at the site 
with respect to one of the sites  our share of the waste volume is estimated to be less than 
at the other site  we contributed less than of the waste 
although no estimates of cleanup costs have yet been completed for these sites  we believe  based on our preliminary review and other factors  including our estimated share of the waste volume at the sites  that the costs relating to these sites will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flow 
we have recorded a liability to the extent such costs are known and estimable for such sites 
we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows or competitive position as a result of compliance with federal  state  provincial  local or foreign environmental laws or regulations  or cleanup costs at the facilities and sites discussed above 
however  some risk of environmental liability and other costs is inherent in the nature of our business  and there can be no assurance that 
table of contents material environmental costs will not arise 
moreover  it is possible that future developments  such as increasingly strict requirements of environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder  could lead to material costs of environmental compliance and cleanup by the company 
impact of newly issued accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  becomes effective for the company on january  based on the unvested stock option awards outstanding as of december   the company expects to record incremental stock based compensation pretax expense of approximately million in as a result of adopting this standard 
we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  for the year ended december  this interpretation did not have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position in  however  there can be no assurance that application of this interpretation to future conditional asset retirement obligations would not have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
the potential effect of these newly issued standards on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows is discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statement and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our most critical accounting policies 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we believe these judgments have been materially accurate in the past and the basis for these judgments should not change significantly in the future 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized in the period title to product passes to customers and collectibility of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
as part of the revenue recognition process  we determine whether the resulting accounts receivable are reasonably assured of collection based on a variety of factors  including an evaluation of whether there has been deterioration in the credit quality of our customers  which could result in us being unable to collect the accounts receivable 
in situations where it is unclear as to whether we will be able to sell or collect the accounts receivable  we will request alternative financing arrangements  such as prepayment or commercial letters of credit  from the customer 
sales incentive  product price protection and returned material allowances we grant incentive allowances to selected customers as part of our sales programs 
the incentives are determined based on certain targeted sales volumes 
in certain instances  we also grant selected product price protection allowances 
certain distribution customers are also allowed to return inventory at the customer s original 
table of contents cost  in an amount not to exceed three percent of the prior year s purchases  in exchange for an order of equal or greater value 
sales revenues are reduced when incentives  allowances or returns are anticipated or projected 
we reduce revenues by recording a separate deduction to gross revenues 
future market conditions and product transitions might require us to take actions to increase customer incentive and product price protection offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive or allowance is offered 
additionally  certain incentive programs require us to estimate  based on historical experience  the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive 
we recognized incentive  price  and returned material allowances totaling million  million and million as deductions to gross revenues in  and  respectively 
the allowances for incentive rebates  price adjustments and returned material at december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on the specific identification method 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of accounts receivable  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
in order to assess the collectibility of the accounts receivable  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
in circumstances where we are aware of a customer s inability or unwillingness to pay outstanding amounts  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to its estimated collectible balance 
there have been occasions over the past decade where we recognized an expense associated with the rapid collapse of a distributor for which no specific reserve had been previously established 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
we recognized bad debt expense of million  million and million as a component of sg a expenses in  and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and was million and million  respectively 
inventory allowances we evaluate the realizability of our inventory on a product by product basis in light of anticipated sales demand  technological changes  product life cycle  component cost trends  product pricing and inventory condition 
in circumstances where inventory levels are in excess of anticipated market demand  where inventory is deemed technologically obsolete or not saleable due to condition or where inventory cost exceeds net realizable value  we record a charge to cost of goods sold and reduce the inventory to its net realizable value 
revisions to these inventory adjustments would be required if any of the factors mentioned above differed from our estimates 
at december  and  we had inventory allowances of million and million  respectively 
deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards  net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences between taxable income on our income tax returns and income before taxes under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
deferred tax assets generally represent future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our consolidated financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we are required to estimate taxable income in future years or develop tax 
table of contents strategies that would enable tax asset realization in each taxing jurisdiction and use judgment to determine whether or not to record a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset 
we recorded an additional million deferred tax asset valuation allowance during with respect to net operating losses generated primarily in the netherlands 
as of december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets related in part to domestic and foreign loss carryforwards  net of valuation allowances totaling million 
the realization of these assets is partially based upon estimates of future taxable income 
based on these estimates  we believe the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances will be realized 
this determination was based on current projections of future taxable income when taking into consideration the potential limitations on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards imposed by section of the internal revenue code section 
section imposed limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards if it experiences an ownership change 
in general terms  an ownership change results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
we believe the ownership change in connection with the july  belden cdt merger will have little  if any  impact upon the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had million of net operating loss carryforwards as adjusted by the tax agreement between us and our former parent  cooper industries ltd unless otherwise utilized  net operating loss carryforwards will expire as follows million in  million in  million between and  and million between and net operating loss carryforwards with an indefinite carryforward period total million 
the net operating loss carryforwards expiring in through will have an immaterial impact on the effective tax rate because of deferred tax asset valuation allowances attached to those losses 
income tax contingencies our effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when  despite the belief that our tax return positions are fully supported  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that our position may not be fully sustained 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  there could be a material effect on our income tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made 
valuation of long lived tangible assets and amortizable intangible assets we review long lived tangible assets and amortizable intangible assets to determine whether an event or change in circumstances indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we base our evaluation on such impairment indicators as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets and any historical or future profitability measurements  as well as other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  we determine whether impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
if impairment has occurred  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between a willing buyer and seller other than in a forced or liquidation sale and can be measured as the asset s quoted market price in an active market or  where an active market for the asset does not exist  our best estimate of fair value based on either discounted cash flow analysis or present value analysis 
the discounted cash flow analyses and present value analyses that we use to estimate the fair value of our long lived tangible assets and amortizable intangible assets are dependent on a number of factors including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates  terminal growth rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are not predictable with precision and therefore are inherently uncertain 
actual future results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents during  we determined that certain asset groups within the european operations of our networking segment were impaired 
the applicable assets of the segment s european operations were impaired due to our decision to exit the united kingdom communications cable market 
we estimated the fair value of the equipment based on anticipated net proceeds from its sale and recognized an impairment loss of million based on the difference between the carrying value of the equipment and its fair value 
this loss was reflected as a component of operating income in the consolidated statement of operations for during  we determined that certain asset groups within both the european operations and the united states operations of our electronics segment were impaired 
the applicable assets of the segment s european operations were impaired due to the exit from certain product lines within those operations 
the applicable assets of the segment s united states operations were impaired due to excess capacity primarily as a result of the combined capacity after the merger 
we estimated the fair value of the equipment based upon anticipated net proceeds from its sale and recognized an impairment loss of million based on the difference between the carrying value of the equipment and its fair value 
this loss was reflected as a component of operating income in the consolidated statement of operations for during  we determined that asset groups within the north american operations of our former communications segment were impaired 
we then estimated fair values using a variety of techniques including discounted cash flows and comparable market data 
assumptions utilized in estimating fair values under continued asset use included long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and capital expenditures 
comparable market data was obtained from appraisals and other third party valuation estimates 
we determined that fair values of asset groups within the north american operations of our former communications segment were less than carrying amounts by million 
we included this impairment charge in loss from discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of operations for during  we identified certain equipment in a german manufacturing facility within our electronics segment that would not be transferred to our other manufacturing facilities after the closure of that facility late in we estimated the fair value of the equipment based upon anticipated net proceeds from its sale and recognized an impairment loss of million based on the difference between the carrying value of the equipment and its fair value 
this loss was reflected as a component of operating income in the consolidated statement of operations for valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization in accordance with sfas no 
 we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment annually or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of these assets may no longer be recoverable 
sfas no 
requires that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value using the income approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment of goodwill has occurred and we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill as a component of operating expenses 
the income approach  which we use to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents sfas no 
requires that an impairment test for an indefinite lived intangible asset not subject to amortization consist of a comparison of the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss should be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
during  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill related to the european reporting unit within our networking segment was impaired due to our decision to exit the united kingdom communications cable market 
we estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill and recognized an impairment loss of million based on the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its implied fair value 
this loss was reflected as a component of operating income in the consolidated statement of operations for during and  we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying value of our goodwill using discounted cash flow projections 
based on the discounted cash flow projections  we determined that the carrying value of our goodwill was recoverable at both december  and we believe that if there is little to no improvement during and beyond from the revenues and profitability achieved by the european reporting unit within our electronics segment  future operating results would adversely affect the discounted future cash flows of those operations and  accordingly  could negatively affect the assessment of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the carrying value of goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  for the european reporting unit within our electronics segment totaled million at december  during and  we also evaluated the recoverability of the carrying values of our indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization 
based on a comparison of the fair values of these assets with their respective carrying values  we determined that the carrying values of our indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization were recoverable at december  and pension and other postretirement benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on the various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions relate to discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  health care cost trend rates and other factors 
we base the discount rate assumptions on current investment yields on high quality corporate long term bonds 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience and future or near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management s expectation of the future economic environment 
our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
our key assumptions are described in further detail in note  pension and other postretirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of the lesser of of the project benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets  amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants 
while the actual rate of return on plan assets over the past five years has been less than the assumed rate of return on plan assets  we believe the assumed rate is a reasonable assumption for the long term performance of our plan assets 
business combination accounting the merger was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase method requires management to make significant estimates 
first  management must determine the cost of the acquired entity based on the fair value of the consideration paid or the fair value of the net assets acquired  whichever is more clearly evident 
this cost is then allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the merger consummation date 
in addition  management must identify and estimate the fair values of intangible assets that should be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
management utilized third party appraisals to assist in estimating the fair value of tangible pp e and intangible assets acquired 
our estimations are described in further detail in note  belden cdt merger  to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 

table of contents outlook we announced in our decision to exit the united kingdom communications market when our contract with british telecom plc expires in october or sooner if the customer can arrange another source 
we are actively exploring alternatives for disposition of our manchester  united kingdom operation 
if unable to arrange a sale of the operation at an acceptable price  we plan to liquidate the assets and liabilities of the operation 
in  the manchester  united kingdom operation generated revenues of million and operating income of million 
our outlook excludes the projected operating results for the manchester  united kingdom operation and  therefore  takes as its baseline revenues of  million  operating income of million  and net income of million 
we anticipate relatively strong end markets in both north america and asia in  however  we expect somewhat slower growth in europe 
we estimate that our revenues will increase between and compared with baseline revenues due primarily to both sales price increases implemented to offset rising raw material costs and improved volume 
management expects improvement in operating income from all parts of the company particularly  from europe and the north american operations within our networking segment 
restructuring in europe is well under way  and management believes its recent reorganization in north america will help leverage the company s strengths and improve the contribution made to operating income by the north american operations within our networking segment 
we anticipate operating margins will reflect continued product mix enrichment in the networking market and will include further migration to higher bandwidth cables  more gigabit projects  and an increasing proportion of connectivity sales 
we will also benefit from the full year realization of the merger synergies in management expects operating income as a percent of revenues will be between and in this outlook  along with the outlook for diluted income per share  excludes the impact of our adoption of sfas no 
r effective january  management anticipates the company will generate diluted income from continuing operations per share  excluding any further restructuring charges  between and in we anticipate funding million in pension contributions and million in contributions for other postretirement benefit plans in the upcoming year 
we also plan to pay off tranches of both our and medium term notes totaling million during we anticipate we will have sufficient funds to satisfy these cash requirements 
management expects that the company s effective tax rate for continuing operations in will be 
because of net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  we anticipate that cash payments of united states income taxes during will be significantly less than tax expense 
cash payments of income taxes for foreign jurisdictions will approximate tax expense 
depreciation and amortization for are expected to total approximately million 
capital expenditures for belden cdt during are expected to be approximately million 
we have incurred severance charges related to the discontinuation of certain operations and with other actions intended to reduce costs 
the amount of the charges recognized but not funded as of december  is million 
management expects that that all of these charges will be funded in this will have a negative effect on cash flow 
management expects that there may be additional restructuring charges severance and asset impairment in future periods that would have a negative effect on both operating results and cash flow 
we anticipate that annual dividends in the aggregate of 
per common share 
per common share each quarter will be paid to all common stockholders 
on february   we announced organizational changes that we expect will change the segmentation of the business 
we announced that our north american operations will be organized in two groups  belden americas division and the specialty products division 
the heads of these two divisions will report to the chief executive officer  as will the president of european operations and the general manager  asia pacific 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from foreign currency exchange rates  certain commodity prices  interest rates and credit extended to customers 
to manage the volatility relating to exposures  we net the exposures on a consolidated basis to take advantage of natural offsets 
for residual exposures  we sometimes enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies in areas such as counterparty exposure and hedging practices 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the terms of such instruments and the transactions to which they relate generally do not exceed twelve months 
each of these risks is discussed below 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we manufacture and sell our products in a number of countries throughout the world  and  as a result  are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency exchange rate management activities is to manage the volatility associated with foreign currency purchases of materials or sales of finished product and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business 
our foreign currency exchange rate management strategy involves the use of natural techniques  where possible  such as the offsetting or netting of like currency cash flows 
where natural techniques are not possible  we will sometimes use foreign currency derivatives  typically foreign currency forward contracts  with durations of generally months or less 
cdt executed a foreign currency swap derivative contract that was assumed by us on the effective date of the merger 
the contract converted a notional amount of million euros into million czech koruny in april we did not consider the contract to be an effective hedge of its cash flow exposure and  therefore  recorded all currency gains or losses in the consolidated statement of operations as they occurred 
we had no other foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december  and did not employ any other foreign currency derivatives during the year then ended 
we generally view as long term our investments in international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the united states dollar 
as a result  we do not generally use derivatives to manage these net investments 
in terms of foreign currency translation risk  we are exposed primarily to the euro  the british pound and the canadian dollar 
our net foreign currency investment in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates translated into united states dollars using year end exchange rates was million and million at december  and  respectively 
commodity price risk certain raw materials used by us are subject to price volatility caused by supply conditions  political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors 
the primary purpose of our commodity price management activities is to manage the volatility associated with purchases of commodities in the normal course of business 
we do not speculate on commodity prices 
we are exposed to price risk related to our purchase of copper used in the manufacture of our products 
our copper price management strategy involves the use of natural techniques  where possible  such as purchasing copper for future delivery at fixed prices 
where natural techniques are not possible  we will sometimes use commodity price derivatives  typically exchange traded forward contracts  with durations of generally twelve months or less 
we did not have any commodity price derivatives outstanding at december  and did not employ any commodity price derivatives during the year then ended 
the following table presents the physical inventory of 
table of contents copper at december  by the amount of pounds held at average cost 
the fair value of this inventory as of december  is also presented 
in thousands  except average price pounds on hand weighted average price per pound value using weighted average price fair value we are also exposed to price risk related to our purchase of selected commodities derived from petrochemical feedstocks used in the manufacture of our products 
we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices established with the vendors as part of the purchase process 
recent trends indicate that pricing of these commodities may become more volatile due to the increased prices of petrochemical feedstocks as well as the current threat of terrorist activities 
historically  we have not used commodity financial instruments to hedge prices for commodities derived from petrochemical feedstocks 
there is a modest correlation  primarily in our networking segment  between costs for commodities derived from petrochemical feedstocks and the ultimate selling price of the product 
exposures to most changes in costs for commodities derived from petrochemical feedstocks remain unprotected 
interest rate risk we have occasionally managed our debt portfolio by using interest rate swap agreements to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates  however we were not a party to any interest rate swap agreements at december  or during the year then ended 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and average interest rates by expected maturity dates
