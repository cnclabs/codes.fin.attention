item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding financial and geographical information relating to our business segments 

table of contents there are several trends that are prevalent in the office imaging industry  including evolution of office workflow process 
the process of distributing information in the workplace has evolved over recent years through technological advances in communication  most notably electronic document delivery via e mail and the internet 
while documents have traditionally been produced on a copier and then distributed to the relevant working groups  electronic document delivery has allowed documents to first be distributed electronically and then printed by the end user on the printer linked to the end user s personal computer or stored for later use 
this evolution has led to the rapid growth of printed documents from desktop and network printers 
copier volume has remained relatively flat and competition from non traditional copier companies  such as manufacturers of desktop and network printers  has increased 
however  recent trends in the application and networking of computer systems throughout the entire office have begun to enable the migration of printed material to the most efficient or cost effective device  which often includes connected digital copiers and mfps 
shift from selling boxes to selling solutions 
the growth in the volume of documents printed from lower volume  desktop and network printers has substantially increased end users per image cost for printed material 
the ability of digital copiers and mfps to be connected to the information technology network has provided an opportunity for end users to reduce their per image costs while optimizing the use of their imaging equipment 
as companies look to reduce costs  they are increasingly requesting comprehensive solutions from their document imaging vendors 
these solutions involve both equipment and related software and service offerings that allow them to better meet their document imaging needs  and optimize the use of their installed equipment 
as such  most leading document imaging vendors are moving away from the analog box sale approach to one of being a provider of solutions that can satisfy their customers print management needs on a more efficient and cost effective basis 
increasing demand for color 
customers continue to demand high performance machines that produce presentation quality documents  leading to an interest in and demand for color equipment 
the emergence of digital copiers  mfps and lower cost color capable copiers allows companies to increase their level of in house document production and produce presentation quality copies for meetings  presentations and mailings 
although the transition to color is accelerating according to industry sources  it represents an increasingly important and growing segment of the market  offering higher revenue growth opportunities for companies in the office imaging industry compared to the black and white market due to the higher cost of some color capable equipment and most related consumable supplies 
the demand for color systems and products continues to grow  and additional manufacturers are entering the market 
as a result  we expect the transactional average selling price to decline going forward 
products and services office imaging systems we offer a large selection of the top brands of office imaging products as part of our document solutions packages 
these products represent a full complement of digital and color copiers  digital and color mfps and facsimile machines  as well as print management software and related parts and supplies 
in the united states  we sell high volume products  which include the kodak nexpress digimaster  canon ir  as well as the toshiba e studio series of digital products 
in the mid volume segment  we sell the full range of canon ir and toshiba e studio series digital copiers and mfps 
in the color segment  we sell the canon clc series of products as well as the toshiba e studio line of color products 
in addition  we sell a full complement of front end print server equipment and a portfolio of applications software which enhances the features and functions of the equipment 
for example  among other things  certain of these software products convert paper information to digital formats and allow the reproduction of documents in a variety of formats  help customers acquire  manage  store and retrieve documents in a secure manner  permit the scanning of paper documents and importation of electronic files and emails  and allow for smart distribution of print jobs across a range of printing devices 
in europe  we sell the kodak nexpress digimaster  as well as high volume products manufactured by ricoh under our infotec brand name  canon  toshiba and hewlett packard 
we also sell a full range of ricoh infotec and canon ir products in the mid volume range in europe  where we also sell a full portfolio of print server equipment and software with the capabilities described above 
technical services we also offer a broad range of field technical services which primarily involve the service and maintenance of our mif 
our worldwide network of field engineers is dedicated to ensuring that customers get maximum up time from their investment in our office imaging systems 
our field engineers are highly trained and capable of servicing multiple equipment brands and are equipped with the experience  training  tools and parts necessary to ensure that customers are provided with rapid response time and first time fix 
table of contents capability 
field engineers have access to a computerized warehouse system that stocks thousands of parts for immediate delivery to customers  and are equipped with laptop computers which contain reference materials and diagnostic software to assist with the early resolution of customer issues 
we generally offer our technical services pursuant to contracts 
our service and supply contracts typically have an initial term of one to three years in the us and four to five years in europe and renew on an annual basis thereafter 
new systems  as designed by manufacturers  are increasingly incorporating new technology into their mfps  that permit field maintenance to be performed by replacing key components with field replaceable units  or frus 
this trend may result in customer s requesting additional flexibility in their maintenance contracts that permit higher levels of self maintenance or time and materials engagements  and may impact the company s service revenue model 
professional services and software we offer a portfolio of value added service and software offerings that provide our customers with efficiency and cost savings opportunities  as well as provide us with supplemental revenue streams 
through our field deployed systems engineers and analysts we provide consulting services to our customers to help them reduce print costs  optimize the use of their office imaging equipment and improve their employees productivity by integrating our proven software solutions to leverage their investment in their imaging equipment

in europe  we also provide services through country level support centers that offer many of the services listed above 
competition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive 
we have competitors in all markets in which we operate  and our competitors include a number of companies worldwide with significant technological  distribution and financial resources 
competition in our industry is based largely upon technology  performance  pricing  quality  reliability  distribution  customer service and support and lease and rental financing 
in addition  our equipment suppliers continue to establish themselves as direct competitors in many of the areas in which we do business 
some manufacturers of products in our industry have been consolidating in an attempt to gain market share and reduce costs 
as such  the availability of certain products may become constrained or such products may become unavailable 
such consolidations may negatively impact our relationships with certain of our partners within the industry 
besides competition from within the office imaging industry  we are also experiencing competition from other sources as a result of evolving technology  including the development of alternative means of document processing  retention  storage and printing 
our retail operations are in direct competition with local and regional equipment suppliers and dealers  manufacturers  mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs 
we have suffered  and may continue to suffer  a reduction of our market share because of the high level of competition in our industry 
the intense competition in our industry may result in pressure on the prices and margins that we can obtain for our products and may affect our ability to retain customers 

table of contents seasonality we have experienced some seasonality in our business 
our european operations have historically experienced lower revenue for the second quarter of our fiscal year  which is the three month period ended september th 
this is primarily due to increased vacation time by european residents during july and august 
this has historically resulted in reduced sales activity and reduced usage of photocopiers  facsimiles and other office imaging equipment during that period 
employees as of march   we employed approximately  persons  with approximately  in our united states segment and approximately  in our europe australia segment 
some of our european employees are subject to labor agreements that  among other things  establish rates of pay and working hours 
we believe that we provide working conditions and wages that are comparable to those of our competitors 
trademarks and service marks we believe that our trademarks and service marks have gained recognition in the office imaging and document management industry and are important to our marketing efforts 
we have registered various trademarks and service marks 
in particular  we believe that the trademarks danka  infotec  techsource and danka the desktop are important to our ongoing business 
our policy is to continue to pursue registration of our marks whenever possible and to vigorously oppose any infringement of our proprietary rights 
depending on the jurisdiction  trademarks and service marks are valid as long as they are in use and or their registrations are properly maintained  and they have not been found to become generic 
registrations of trademarks and service marks in the united states can generally be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks and service marks are in use 
backlog backlogs are not material to our business 
item properties our general policy is to lease  rather than own  our business locations 
we lease numerous properties for administration  sales  service and distribution functions and for our retail and wholesale operations 
as of march   our principal facilities include  square feet of leased office space in st 
petersburg  florida that we use for our us and corporate operations 
the terms vary under the leases 
some of our leases contain a right of first refusal or an option to purchase the underlying real property and improvements 
in general  our lease agreements require us to pay our proportionate share of taxes  common area expenses  insurance and related costs of the rental properties 
our management believes that the properties we occupy are  in general  suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used 
item legal proceedings in june  we were served with a putative class action complaint titled stephen l 
edwards  et al  plaintiffs vs 
danka industries  inc  et al  including american business credit corporation  defendants  alleging claims of breach of contract  fraud intentional misrepresentation  unjust enrichment  violation of the florida deception and unfair trade protection act and seeking injunctive relief 
the claim was filed in the state court in tennessee  and we have removed the claim to the united states district court for the middle district of tennessee for further proceedings 
the plaintiffs have filed a motion to certify the class  which we have opposed 
we have filed a motion for summary judgment  which plaintiffs have opposed 
while the amount sought in the complaint is in excess of  we cannot  at this time  estimate its potential exposure 
we intend to vigorously defend all claims alleged by the plaintiffs 
we are also subject to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of our business 
we do not expect these legal proceedings to have a material effect upon our financial position  results of operations or liquidity

table of contents footnotes to selected financial data during fiscal year  we determined that based on changes in our business environment and an analysis of projected cash flows  the carrying amount of certain goodwill and other long lived assets in europe australia would not be recoverable 
accordingly  the resulting analysis necessitated a goodwill write down of million

we currently operate in over countries 
our reportable segments are the united states and europe australia  which include operations that are experiencing political  social and or economic difficulty 
we continue to evaluate the viability and future prospects of the operations in certain countries in light of uncertain conditions 
based on these evaluations  we sold our operations in canada and central and south america during fiscal year  and we sold our operations in portugal and russia during fiscal year should we decide to downsize or exit any of our other operations in the future  we could incur costs in respect of severance and closure of facilities and we may also be required to realize cumulative translation losses and minimum pension liabilities that would reduce our earnings  all or any of which may have a material impact on our operating results 
all tables presented herein are in thousands unless otherwise noted 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply various accounting policies 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  as their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  since financial reporting results rely on estimates of the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide allowances for doubtful accounts and allowances for billing disputes and inaccuracies on our accounts receivable as follows allowances for doubtful accounts generally credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of the customer s financial condition and collateral is generally not required 
some of the factors that we consider in determining whether to record an allowance against accounts receivable include the age of the receivable  historical write off experience and current economic conditions 
allowances for billing disputes and inaccuracies because of the difficulties we experience in accurately recording the number of copies made by customers  entering contract information into our system and timely identifying and correcting billing errors  we reduce revenue for an estimate of future credits that will be issued for billing disputes and billing inaccuracies at the time of sale 
these estimates are established based on our historical experience of write offs and credits issued for billing disputes and inaccuracies and are influenced by a number of considerations 

table of contents the following table summarizes our net accounts receivable march  march  accounts receivable  gross allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable  net allowance for doubtful accounts as a of gross accounts receivable inventories we acquire inventory based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any unexpected decline in demand and or rapid product improvements or technological changes may cause us to have excess and or obsolete inventories 
we have provided an appropriate estimate of reserves against these inventory items in current and prior periods 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions using historical trends and analysis 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts due  in part  to a greater acceleration within the industry to digital office imaging equipment  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our estimates are influenced by a number of considerations including  but not limited to  the following decline in demand due to economic downturns  rapid product improvements and technological changes  and our ability to return to vendors a certain percentage of our purchases 
revenue recognition we generally have agreements to provide product maintenance services for the equipment that we sell or lease to customers 
we follow the guidance in the emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  as modified for the impact of higher level accounting literature  to allocate revenue received between the two deliverables in the arrangement the equipment and the product maintenance services 
for arrangements in which the product maintenance services meet the definition in the financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin tb no 
 accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts tb  of a separately priced product maintenance contract  revenue equal to the amount paid by the customer to obtain the product maintenance services is allocated to the separately priced maintenance agreement  with the remainder of the revenue allocated to the equipment or operating lease payments for use of the equipment 
for arrangements in which the product maintenance services does not meet the definition in tb of a separately priced product maintenance contract  but the revenue recognized related to the equipment is governed by fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases sfas  revenue is allocated between the equipment or operating lease payments for use of the equipment and product maintenance services on a relative fair value basis using our best estimate of fair value of the equipment or operating lease payments for use of the equipment and of the product maintenance services 
revenue from wholesale and retail equipment and related sales  including revenue allocated to equipment sales as discussed above  is recognized upon acceptance of delivery by the customer 
in the case of equipment sales financed by third party finance leasing companies  revenue is recognized at the later of acceptance of delivery by the customer or credit acceptance by the finance leasing company 
in addition  for the sale of certain digital equipment that requires a comprehensive setup by us before it can be used by a customer  revenue is recognized upon the customer s written confirmation of delivery and installation 
supply sales to customers are recognized at the time of shipment unless supply sales are included in a service contract  in which case supply sales are recognized upon equipment usage by the customer 
we sell equipment with embedded software to our customers 
the embedded software is not sold separately  is not a significant focus of the marketing effort  and we do not provide post contract customer support specific to the software or incur significant costs that are within the scope of fasb statement no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed sfas 
additionally  the functionality that the software provides is marketed as part of the overall product 
the software embedded in the equipment is incidental to the equipment as a whole such that fasb statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sfas  is not applicable 
revenue from the sales of equipment subject to an operating lease  or of equipment that is leased by or intended to be leased by the purchaser to another party  and sales type leases is recognized in accordance with sfas revenue from all other sales of equipment is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
rental operating lease income is recognized straight line over the lease term 
retail service revenues are generally recognized ratably over the term of the underlying product maintenance contracts 
under the terms of the product maintenance contract  the customer is billed a flat periodic charge and or a usage based fee 
the typical agreement includes an allowance for a minimum number of copies for a base service fee plus an overage charge for any copies in excess of the minimum 
we record revenue each period for the flat periodic charge and for actual or estimated usage 
cost of sales inbound freight charges are included in inventory 
when the inventory is sold  the cost of the inventory  including the inbound freight charges  is relieved and charged to costs of sales 
when the inventory is rented  the cost of the inventory  including the inbound freight charges  is relieved and transferred to the rental equipment asset account 
the cost of the rental equipment asset is then depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment 
the depreciation of rental equipment assets is included in rental costs 

table of contents purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs  warehousing costs and other distribution costs are included in selling  general and administrative costs because no meaningful allocation of these expenses to equipment  supplies  rental and wholesale costs of sales is practicable 
accordingly  our gross margins may not be comparable to other companies  since some companies include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of sales  while others exclude a portion of them from gross margin  including them instead in operating expense line items 
these costs totaled million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
we receive vendor rebates based on arrangements with certain equipment vendors 
those arrangements typically require vendors to make incentive payments to the company based on the volume of periodic purchases dollar amounts  quantity of specific units  etc such rebates are accrued when purchases are made and can be reasonably estimated  recorded as reductions of inventory costs when accrued and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales when the related inventories are sold 
deferred income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we have to determine our income and corporation taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves determining our actual current tax expense and loss carryforwards together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenues and expenses for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
our past financial performance is a significant factor which contributes to our inability  pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  to use projections of future taxable income in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets 
management therefore is limited to considering the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
considering all relevant data  management concluded that it is not more likely than not we will realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets at march  consequently  we have a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in most jurisdictions at march  in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income and corporation taxes have been made for all years 
goodwill we had goodwill of million as of march  we review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually for possible impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
separable intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill was reviewed for possible impairment during each of the fourth quarters of our fiscal years and  in accordance with sfas in performing our impairment testing  we engaged an independent appraisal company to assist in the valuation of our reporting units 
the fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a guideline company method using valuation multiples 
the discounted cash flow model used estimates of future revenue and expenses for each reporting unit as well as appropriate discount rates  and the estimates that were used are consistent with the plans and estimates the company is using to manage the underlying business 
based on the analysis at january   management determined that the goodwill balance was impaired for its europe australia reporting unit 
as such  additional goodwill impairment testing was completed for that reporting unit  and based on the result of that testing  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year no such charge was needed for fiscal year accounting for stock based compensation as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we account for our stock option plans under the intrinsic value recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
as the exercise prices of all options granted under these plans were equal to the market price of the underlying american depositary shares ads on the grant date  million stock based employee compensation expense was recognized in net earnings related to the issuance of shares to our board of directors pursuant to the outside director stock compensation plan 
in general  these options expire in ten years and vest over three years 
the proceeds from options exercised are credited to shareholders equity deficit  net of related tax benefits 
for current disclosure purposes  we compute the impact to earnings loss of stock based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model 
sfas allows the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  an amendment of sfas sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based payments using apb and instead requires companies to 
table of contents recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method for costs related to share based payments  including stock options 
the expense will be measured as the fair value of the award at its grant date based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest  and recorded over the applicable service period 
in the absence of an observable market price for a share based award  the fair value would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
the requirements of sfas r are effective for our fiscal year beginning april  early adoption of the provisions of sfas r is encouraged  but not required 
the company has elected the modified retrospective method of applying sfas r 
at meetings held on january and   our human resources committee of the board of directors and our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all of our stock options outstanding as of january  the acceleration of the options took place on march  the purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable us to avoid recognizing in our income statement compensation expense associated with these options in future periods  due to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the pre tax charge to be avoided upon adoption of sfas r is expected to be approximately million and represents the fair value of the unvested awards as of the date of the acceleration as determined under sfas as a result of the accelerated vesting  approximately million shares with varying remaining vesting schedules became immediately exercisable 
in order to help avoid unintended personal benefits to holders of the accelerated options  any shares received through exercise of accelerated options may not be sold by the option holder until the original vesting date of the accelerated option or the termination of the employment of the option holder  whichever occurs first 
in connection with the accelerated vesting  each option agreement underlying such options was amended 
as a result of the accelerated vesting of the options  we recorded an immaterial charge to earnings under apb we expect the adoption of sfas r will have an unfavorable impact for all future grants on our consolidated results of operations and net earnings loss per common share 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current guidelines 
this requirement may reduce our net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
all grants after march  will be valued using a binomial pricing model and we will recognize the associated expense over the vesting period based on the fair values determined by the binomial pricing model using the accelerated attribution method 
restructuring charges we recognized restructuring charges for the consolidation of back office functions  exiting non strategic real estate facilities and reducing headcount 
these charges are recorded pursuant to formal plans developed and approved by management 
these charges are accounted for under the provisions of fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits sfas and fasb statement no 
 accounting for cost associated with exit or disposal activities sfas and the recognition of restructuring charges requires that we make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature  timing and amount of costs associated with these plans 
the estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring additional restructuring charges or the reduction of liabilities already recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with the restructuring programs 
for further discussion of our restructuring programs  refer to note restructuring charges credits to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
controls and procedures management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of march  based upon this assessment and as more fully explained in item a controls and procedures  management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of march  related to our revenue and billing process 
during the testing phase  management began developing remediation plans and is in the process of finalizing those plans 
once remediation plans are finalized  timelines where determinable will be established to complete those plans 
financial condition march  march  total assets total liabilities working capital liabilities to liabilities and capital inventory turnover ratio x x total assets as of march  decreased million or from march  this decrease was due to several factors  including the sale of our canadian and central and south american subsidiaries which reduced assets held for sale by million 

table of contents accounts receivable decreased million resulting from improved collections and decreasing revenue 
in addition  cash decreased million to fund operations  and fixed assets and rental assets decreased million due to continuing depreciation of assets and decreased capital spending on rental assets during fiscal year total liabilities decreased million from march   or 
this decrease was also due to several factors including the sale of our canadian and central and south american subsidiaries which reduced liabilities held for sale by million  and a decrease in accrued expenses of million due to the payout of restructuring accruals of million and payouts of other accrued professional fees of million primarily related to our sarbanes oxley compliance efforts during fiscal year 
taxes payable decreased by million due to favorable resolutions of tax contingenies 
these decreases in liabilities were offset by an increase in our borrowings on our credit facility which totaled million at the end of fiscal year working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  decreased million from march  primarily resulting from the sale of our canadian and central and south american subsidiaries discussed above 
liabilities to liabilities and capital increased at march  compared to march  due to operating losses during fiscal year for the period ending march   our annualized inventory turnover ratio remained stable at x

we have not aggregated any of our operating segments 
during fiscal year  our operating segments were the united states and europe australia  both of which were organized based on geographic areas 
our chief operating decision maker relies on an internal management reporting process that provides segment revenue and earnings from operations as shown in our consolidated statement of operations

for fiscal year  our revenue decreased by million or from fiscal year  with the united states segment decreasing million or and europe australia decreasing million or 
service revenues continued to decrease due in part to the continued conversion from analog devices to digital devices and a shift and decline in certain segments of our installed base 
in addition  we are experiencing decreases in our click rates per copy charge due to competitive pricing pressures and slower than expected growth in service volume from newer printer manufacturer customers 
our retail equipment and related sales increased slightly due to higher unit placements during the year 
this increase was offset by increased pricing pressures coupled with product portfolio gaps including our page per minute color machine offerings and other weaknesses in certain areas of our europe australia business  most notably  the united kingdom 
these issues  combined with the advent of other competitive equipment from printer manufacturers  may continue to hinder our progress in growing our retail equipment and related sales revenue

retail supplies and rental revenue declined by million or to million in fiscal year with the united states segment down million or 
this decline was primarily due to non investment in rental equipment 
in addition  renewal negotiations with certain governmental agencies were not completed during the fiscal year resulting in the inability to record million of rental revenue during the current fiscal year 
retail supplies and rental revenue in the europe australia segment was down million or 
the decrease in supplies is a result of the trend in the united kingdom where color machine service contracts are moving from being exclusive to inclusive of toner supplies and thus the related revenue is moving from supplies to service 
this decrease included a negative foreign currency movement of million or 
wholesale revenue declined by million or to million  due in part to pricing pressures 
during fiscal year  we changed the it platform in our european wholesale business to oracle and moved the physical location of the administration center

retail service margins decreased to from in the year ago period 
in the united states  the margins decreased from to  and in europe australia the margins decreased from to 
generally  the decrease in retail service margins was due to the fixed cost element of the service business  combined with lower revenue  and the decision to retain rather than reduce service personnel in anticipation of future service business with certain customers 
in addition  service revenues were impacted by the slower than expected ramp up of some of our printer manufacturer contracts combined with start up costs incurred to generate these contracts 
retail supplies and rental margins decreased to from in the year ago period 
in the united states  the margin decreased due to continuing depreciation being taken for rental equipment on contracts with certain governmental customers for which revenues have not been recognized in the current fiscal year as there had been delays in executing purchase orders by those customers as discussed above

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a during fiscal year decreased by million or from the year ago period to million from million 
as a percentage of total revenue  sg a expenses decreased to in the current year from in the prior year 
this decline reflects the success of our vision reengineering initiative  including significant headcount reductions and reduced facility costs

during the year ago period  we took a restructuring charge of primarily relating to severance charges under the fiscal year restructuring plan 
impairment charges goodwill was reviewed for possible impairment as of january  and  in accordance with sfas no 
in performing our impairment testing  we engaged an independent appraisal company to assist in the valuation of our reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting units were determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow model and a guideline company method using valuation multiples 
the discounted cash flow model used estimates of future revenue and expenses for each reporting unit as well as appropriate discount rates  and the estimates that were used are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
based on the analysis at january   management determined that the goodwill balance was impaired for its europe australia reporting unit 
as such  additional goodwill impairment testing was completed for that reporting unit  and based on those results  we recorded an impairment charge totaling million during fiscal year no such charge was needed during fiscal year other income expense other expense decreased million year over year primarily due to a loss of million associated with the disposal of our subsidiaries in portugal and russia in the prior year period 
operating earnings loss from continuing operations our operating loss from continuing operations was million for fiscal year compared to a loss of million in the prior year period 
during fiscal year  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
this decrease in operating loss was further attributable to the decreases in sg a  offset by lower sales and our lower gross margins as discussed above 
interest expense and interest income interest expense and interest income remained relatively stable for fiscal year at million and million  respectively 
income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million in the fiscal year compared to a tax benefit of million in the prior year period

revenues declined million primarily due to ongoing service declines in the uk  germany and france as a result of reduced mif and a de emphasis on rental investments 
this decrease was partially offset by a positive foreign currency movement of million or 
retail supplies and rental revenue declined by million or to million 
the decline in our revenue was primarily due to the transition in our industry from analog to digital products and the resulting lower retail placements  reduced mif  increased competition as a result of technology convergence  such as the advent of multifunctional peripherals mfps  and an increase in the migration of copy volume from copiers to network printers and weaker global economic conditions which resulted in reduced or delayed capital spending by customers 
retail supplies and rental revenues in the united states was down million or in fiscal year supplies decreased in the united states segment primarily due to the decline in our kodak analog base 
the kodak base uses a proprietary supply product and that page volume is rapidly moving to digital  a natural but negative consequence of the analog to digital transition 
rental revenue decreased due to strategic initiatives to de emphasize investment in rental equipment as leases expire  and our lack of investment in new rental placements is likely to continue downward pressure in these revenue streams 
this initiative reduces cash outlays for such equipment

margins increased in our united states segment due to lower national and enterprise revenues which tend to have low margins 
this increase was offset by lower europe australia margins due to pricing competition and sales force turnover 
retail service margins decreased to from in the year ago period primarily due to lower revenues offset by lower parts and labor costs 
retail supplies and rental margins decreased to from 
margins increases related to the de emphasis on investment in rental equipment  which resulted in lower depreciation costs for the year 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in supplies margins in the united states due to the decline in our kodak analog base which generally has higher margins 
wholesale margins decreased to from in the year ago period due to a shift toward lower margin business in an effort to win back customer loyalty resulting from poor execution on deliveries to customers due to back office constraints 
our conversion to our oracle system will help to alleviate these constraints  even though we experienced some difficulties due to the implementation of the system

the fiscal year restructuring charge was partially offset by a million reversal of prior years restructuring charges as a result of employee attrition and a change in restructuring plans offset by higher than originally estimated facility closure costs 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  we formulated plans to significantly reduce our sg a costs by consolidating our back office functions in the united states  exiting non strategic real estate facilities and reducing headcount in the americas and europe australia 
as part of those plans  we recorded a million restructuring charge in fiscal year that included million related to severance for employees and million related to future lease obligations for facilities 
the fiscal year restructuring charges were partially offset by a million reversal of prior years restructuring charges 
we expected to realize between million and million in connection with the fiscal year restructuring plan

our results of operations and financial condition have been  and in the future may be  adversely affected by the fluctuations in foreign currencies and by translation of the financial statements of our european subsidiaries  from local currencies to the united states dollar

during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year  we used our cash more evenly throughout the periods and have used cash to reduce our accounts payable and accrued expenses  which we expect will help improve the operation of our business 
in the first and third quarter of every fiscal year  we make combined interest payments of million for the subordinated notes and the senior notes 
generally  cash provided by operations and cash on the balance sheet continue to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures 
our net cash flow used in operating activities during fiscal year was million 
our net cash flow provided by operating activities was million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows from operations during fiscal year is a result of the continuing decline in our revenues and the resulting decline in our gross profit  payouts of restructuring of million  payouts of accrued professional fees of million and reductions in other accrued expenses 
these uses of cash were offset somewhat by improved collections of accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in cash flows during fiscal year is a result of declines in our revenues and declines in our gross profit

the actions needed to achieve these savings had been taken in steps  beginning with the charges taken in fiscal year and were expected to require up to million of cash 
our current estimate of cash required has been reduced to million to million in cash due to lower severance payouts than expected and favorable termination terms for facility leases

accordingly  dividends  which are cumulative  were paid in the form of additional participating shares through december at that time  we were obliged to pay the participating share dividends in cash 
however  the terms of the participating shares permit us to continue to pay payment in kind dividends following december  if our then existing principal indebtedness  which includes our credit facility and debt securities issued in an aggregate principal amount in excess of million in a bona fide underwritten public or private offering  prohibits us from paying cash dividends 
further  if we are not permitted by the terms of the participating shares to pay payment in kind dividends following december  and we have insufficient distributable reserves under english law to pay cash dividends  the amount of any unpaid dividend will be added to the liquidation return of each participating share 
the holders of the participating shares are  in general  entitled to appoint two directors to the board 
since the company has not paid dividends in cash for six successive quarters following december  they are entitled to appoint a further two directors until the time the company has paid cash dividends on the participating shares for four successive quarters 
as of june   the holders of the participating shares have appointed three directors to the company s board of directors 
the participating shares are currently convertible into ordinary shares at a conversion price of per ordinary share equal to per ads  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances to avoid dilution of the interests of participating shareholders 
as of march  the participating shares have voting rights  on an as converted basis  currently corresponding to approximately of the total voting power of our capital stock which includes an additional  participating shares in respect of payment in kind dividends 
if  by december   we have not converted or otherwise redeemed the participating shares  we are required  subject to compliance with applicable laws and the instruments governing our indebtedness  and except as set out immediately following to redeem all of the then outstanding participating shares 
if we fail to do this  we must then redeem the maximum number of such shares that can then lawfully be redeemed  assuming that the liquidation value per participating share is at that time greater than the market value of the ordinary shares into which the participating shares are convertible 
the amount to be paid on the redemption of each participating share in cash is the greater of a the then liquidation value or b the then market value of the ordinary shares into which the participating shares are convertible  in each case plus accumulated and unpaid dividends from the most recent dividend payment date 
if the price set out in b above is applicable  we are permitted to convert the participating shares into the number of ordinary shares into which they are convertible instead of making the cash payment 
english company law to which we are subject  as an english corporation requires that the participating shares may be redeemed only out of our accumulated  realized profits as described below  and generally described under english law as distributable profits or  subject to some restrictions  the proceeds of a new issuance of shares for the purposes of financing the redemption 
we currently estimate that  as of december   the liquidation value of the then outstanding participating shares will be approximately million 
to the extent that we are legally permitted to do so  and except where a majority of our board of directors decides bona fide that to do so would be materially prejudicial to the business of the subsidiary undertaking  we are required to use our best efforts to ensure that our subsidiary undertakings distribute to us a sufficient amount of their profits  if any  to enable us to redeem the convertible participating shares 
if we have insufficient distributable profits on december  to redeem the participating shares in full  we will be required to use our best efforts to complete a fresh issue of shares and use the proceeds of that fresh issue to finance the redemption 
as of the date of this document  we have no distributable profits 
however  in determining whether we are able to issue new shares  we may take into account then prevailing market conditions and other factors deemed reasonable by a majority of our board of directors  and we will not be required to issue new shares to the extent prohibited by our then existing indebtedness  whether under our principal bank credit facilities or pursuant to debt securities issued in an aggregate principal amount in excess of million in a bona fide underwritten public offering or in a bona fide private offering 
in the event that we are unable to redeem all of the then outstanding participating shares on december   we are required to redeem so many of the shares as we are able  pro rata among the holders of the participating shares 
any participating shares that are not so redeemed shall remain outstanding  but shall thereafter be entitled to dividends at an increased rate of per annum until redemption 
in the event of liquidation of danka  participating shareholders will be entitled to receive a distribution equal to the greater of a the liquidation return per share initially  and subject to upward adjustment on certain default events by us plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends accumulating from the most recent dividend date or b the amount that would have been payable on each participating share if it had been converted into ordinary shares if the market value of those shares exceed the liquidation value of the participating shares 

table of contents we are likely either to pursue alternative financing arrangements or modifications in relation to the relevant requirements in relation both to the redemption of the participating shares and to the maturity of the million of senior notes due in june in order to manage our liquidity and capital requirements beyond those dates 
general electric capital corporation we have an agreement with general electric capital corporation gecc under which gecc agrees to provide financing to our qualified united states customers to purchase equipment 
the agreement expires march  in connection with this agreement  we are obligated to provide a minimum level of customer leases to gecc 
the minimum level of customer leases is equal to a specified percentage of united states retail equipment and related sales revenues 
if we fail to provide a minimum level of customer leases under the agreement  we are obligated to pay penalty payments to gecc 
for the fiscal years ended march   and  the company was not required to make any penalty payments 
for the fiscal year ended march  the company was obligated for penalty payments of million 
tax payments we have not paid substantial amounts of income tax in the prior three years because of our net operating losses in many jurisdictions due to our net operating losses in those jurisdictions 
we are subject to audits by multiple tax authorities with respect to prior years and paid million in fiscal year related to these audits 
we expect to pay between million and million to certain european tax authorities within fiscal year principally as a result of audits nearing settlements 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas sfas r eliminates the ability to account for share based payments using accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and instead requires companies to recognize compensation expense using a fair value based method for costs related to share based payments  including stock options 
the expense will be measured as the fair value of the award at its grant date based on the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest  and recorded over the applicable service period 
in the absence of an observable market price for a share based award  the fair value would be based upon a valuation methodology that takes into consideration various factors  including the exercise price of the award  the expected term of the award  the current price of the underlying shares  the expected volatility of the underlying share price  the expected dividends on the underlying shares and the risk free interest rate 
the requirements of sfas r are effective for our fiscal year beginning april  early adoption of the provisions of sfas r is encouraged  but not required 
the company has elected the modified retrospective method in applying sfas r 
at meetings held on january and   our human resources committee of the board of directors and our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all of our stock options outstanding as of january  the acceleration of the options took place on march  the purpose of the accelerated vesting was to enable us to avoid recognizing in our income statement compensation expense associated with these options in future periods  due to the adoption of sfas r 
the pre tax charge to be avoided upon adoption of sfas r is expected to be approximately million and represents the fair value of the unvested awards as of the date of the acceleration as determined under sfas as a result of the accelerated vesting  approximately million shares with varying remaining vesting schedules became immediately exercisable 
in order to help avoid unintended personal benefits to holders of the accelerated options  any shares received through exercise of accelerated options may not be sold by the option holder until the original vesting date of the accelerated option or the termination of the employment of the option holder  whichever occurs first 
in connection with the accelerated vesting  each option agreement underlying such options was amended 
as a result of the accelerated vesting of the options  we recorded an immaterial charge to earnings under apb we expect the adoption of sfas r will have an unfavorable impact for all future grants on our consolidated results of operations and net income per common share 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current guidelines 
this requirement may reduce our net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
all grants after march  will be valued using a binomial pricing model and we will recognize the associated expense over the vesting period based on the fair values determined by the binomial pricing model using the accelerated attribution method

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed include foreign exchange risk and interest rates on debt 

table of contents interest rate risk our market risk is primarily limited to fluctuations in interest rates as it pertains to our borrowings under our credit facility  while the senior notes and the subordinated notes bear a fixed rate 
we have outstanding million of subordinated notes that have a fixed annual interest rate of and interest payments of million for the subordinated notes will be paid every six months on april and october the subordinated notes mature on april  we have outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that have a fixed annual interest rate of and interest payments of million for the senior notes will be paid every six months on june and december the senior notes mature on june  we also have a credit facility with bank of america  which acquired fleet capital corporation  that expires on january   to provide a million  senior secured revolving credit facility  which includes a million sublimit for standby and documentary letters of credit 
the fleet credit facility bears interest at an annual rate equal to  at our option  a the sum of the rate of interest publicly announced from time to time by bank of america as its prime or base rate of interest plus the applicable margin thereon or b the sum of libor for interest periods at our option of one  two  three or nine months plus the applicable margin thereon 
on december   we entered into a one year letter of credit facility with abn amro 
on november   this agreement was amended to provide us a letter of credit facility for euro million us million and an open term credit facility of euro million us million available for general working capital purposes  including overdrafts 
the open term credit facility expired on november  the letter of credit facility expired on december  the facilities were secured by the assets of certain of our netherlands subsidiaries and were also cash collateralized by euro million us million 
on january   we opened a replacement letter of credit facility with abn amro in favor of ricoh in the amount of euro million us million that is fully cash collateralized and will expire on june  this agreement can be renewed 
foreign currency exchange risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may impact future earnings and or cash flows 
revenue from europe australia represented approximately and of our consolidated revenue during fiscal years and  respectively 
the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to solely isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect of these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international subsidiaries into united states dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
while we may hedge specific transaction risks  we have not done so and we generally do not hedge translation risks because we believe there is no long term economic benefit in doing so 
at march   we had no outstanding forward contracts or option contracts to buy or sell foreign currency 
for the fiscal years  and there were no gains or losses included in our consolidated statements of operations on forward contracts and option contracts 
assets and liabilities are matched in the local currency  which reduces the need for united states dollar conversion 
any foreign currency impact on translating assets and liabilities into dollars is included as a component of shareholders equity 
our revenue results for fiscal year were negatively impacted by a million foreign currency movement  primarily due to the weakening of the euro and the british pound sterling versus the us dollar 
changes in foreign exchange rates that have the largest impact on translating our international operating profits relate to the euro and the british pound sterling versus the united states dollar 
we estimate that a adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have decreased our revenues by approximately million in fiscal year  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
as discussed above  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
further  the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
seasonality we have experienced some seasonality in our business 
our european operations have historically experienced lower revenue for the second quarter of our fiscal year  which is the three month period ended september th 
this is primarily due to increased vacation time by european residents during july and august 
this has historically resulted in reduced sales activity and reduced usage of photocopiers  facsimiles and other office imaging equipment during that period
