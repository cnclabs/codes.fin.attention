see item business 
our revenues are derived mainly from license fees from software license agreements entered into between axs one and our customers and resellers with respect to both our products and  to a lesser degree  third party products resold by axs one and services revenues from software maintenance agreements  training  consulting services including installation and custom programming 
we are based in rutherford  new jersey with full time employees  as of december   in offices worldwide  including australia  singapore  south africa  the united kingdom and the united states 
our foreign offices generated approximately of our total revenues for the twelve months ended december  we expect that such revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues in the future 
most of our international license fees and services revenues are denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar in the future could result in fluctuations in our revenue 
we have a ownership in a joint venture in our south african operation  axs one african solutions pty ltd african solutions 
african solutions sells and services our suite of products 
we use the equity method of accounting for our investment whereby the investment  including loans to the joint venture  is stated at cost plus or minus our equity in undistributed earnings or losses 
we encounter competition for all of our products in all markets and compete primarily based on the quality of our products  our price  our customer service and our time to implement 
the timing of the release of new products is also important to our ability to generate sales 
during the second half of  we launched our records compliance management solution for e mail and instant messaging archival  supervision  and legal discovery in response to new regulatory requirements for financial institutions in the united states as well as to address the need to reduce costs in the email management area 
during  axs one announced further significant development on the axs one compliance platform  focusing primarily on performance based enhancements 
version  featuring rapid axs  was launched in may  and introduced patent pending search functionality 
rapid axs takes advantage of grid computing architecture and leverages commodity hardware to deliver what axs one believes to be an unmatched price performance ratio 
version also introduced a search wizard  reducing the potential complexity of searches for non it staff and ensuring error proof search capabilities for legal discovery 
finally in axs one announced axs link for desktop  a desktop archiving product available both as an integrated component of the axs one compliance platform  as well as a stand alone solution 
our records compliance management software  including this new solution  accounted for approximately of our total license fee revenues for the year ended december  our future ability to grow revenue will be directly affected by continued price competition and our ability to sustain a high maintenance revenue base from which to grow 
our growth rate and total revenues depend significantly on future services for existing customers as well as our ability to expand our customer base and to respond successfully to the pace of technological change 
in order to expand our customer base  we have been actively seeking partnerships with resellers to supplement our direct sales force 
during  axs one announced several partnerships and began to recognize revenues from some of these 
the most significant of these was an announcement in january with sun microsystems whereby the two organizations entered into a technology development and license agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  sun is marketing  licensing  implementing and supporting the entire axs one compliance platform product suite worldwide as well as marketing and supporting this suite through sun s iforce partners its global reseller network 
in addition to formalizing and expanding its global relationship with sun microsystems  axs one has developed relationships around the world with sun iforce resellers and expects to continue this strategy throughout initial successes have been recorded in australia and the us 
throughout  axs one continued to expand its reseller network in asia  announcing partnerships with organizations in hong kong  china  india  malaysia  the philippines and thailand 
all resellers have been fully trained to sell the product with new sales closed or pending 
in response to the growing demand for hosted archiving solutions and software as a service  axs one continues to expand its channel strategy  entering into partnerships in with bt worldwide and amerivault in the us 
axs one expects its channel strategy to include partnership development into this expanding market 
if our maintenance renewal rate or pace of new customer acquisitions slows  our revenues and operating results would be adversely affected 
see risk factors 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
we believe that domestic and international operating results and cash flows will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors 
for a description of the factors that may affect our operating results see risk factors 
during  axs one saw renewed interest in our axs one central data archive product from both existing and new customers 
one of the key business drivers for this appears to be extended pressure for financial services organizations to be in compliance with rule a of the us securities and exchange commission promulgated under the securities exchange act sec a as well as interest across all industries in the sarbanes oxley act of in the united states and the requirement for organizations to manage and provide evidence of the trustworthiness of their financial statements 
the ability of our digital technology to reproduce states of time on demand ie  to reproduce any single transaction  as well as all corresponding documents and data is enabling customers to maintain their compliance with sec a as well as to address the requirements of sarbanes oxley or other regulations and policies that address records retention in the future 
in september  we announced that the four largest uk based tour operators thomas cook  mytravel  first choice and tui had signed three year subscription agreements with axs one for our e delivery service based on the axs one central archive which has been endorsed by the caa  the uk based civil aviation authority 
the same month  we also signed a similar agreement with one of the largest european ferry companies 
during axs one e delivery service  developed for the european travel industry  went live 
at the end of  tour operators had subscribed to the e delivery service 
we continue to make progress growing our customer base for our e mail archival and electronic retention management based solutions 
this includes both extending opportunities within existing customers as well as acquiring new customers

the decrease in other related parties revenue resulted from decreases in both management fee revenue and consulting revenue 
the decrease in management fees  inclusive of director s fees charged to african solutions  was as a result of our decision in the fourth quarter of to temporarily stop charging director s fees until the african solutions joint venture becomes profitable 
the decrease in consulting revenue resulted from decreased use of our consultants by african solutions 
operating expenses cost of license fees consist primarily of amortization of capitalized software development costs and royalties related to third party software resold by axs one in conjunction with the licensing of our products 
the elements can vary substantially from period to period as a percentage of license fees 
cost of license fees decreased million or from to primarily as a result of a decrease of million in amortization of capitalized software development costs and a decrease of million in third party software royalty fees 
cost of services consists primarily of personnel and third party costs for product quality assurance  training  installation  consulting and customer support 
cost of services decreased million or from to partially due to a decrease of personnel related expenses of million  a decrease of million in variable compensation resulting from a decrease in revenue  and a decrease in billable expense of million 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in third party consultants costs due to the use of these resources to supplement our internal employees on a large project in our south african operations 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses related to sales and marketing personnel as well as travel and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million or from to primarily due to an increase of million of employee related costs due to the hiring of more highly qualified sales and marketing personnel during the period  million in marketing programs  offset partially by million of lower variable compensation and million of other miscellaneous expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  costs of equipment  facilities and third party software development cost 
research and development expenses are generally charged to operations as incurred 
however  certain software development costs are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
such capitalized software development costs are amortized to cost of license fees on a straight line basis over periods not exceeding three years 
research and development expenses net of capitalized software development costs decreased million or from to due primarily to a decrease in personnel related expense of million resulting from lower headcount and a reduction of million of outside consultants expenses offset partially by lower capitalized software development costs which were million in and only thousand in the rate of capitalization of software development costs may fluctuate depending on the mix and stage of development of our research and development projects 
the decrease in capitalized costs during was mainly from a change in the nature of our development efforts for rcm products versus the historical enterprise financial products 
the nature of our current development for rcm products is generally such that we can measure technological feasibility most effectively using the working model method where the time between establishment of a working model and general availability is of short duration which results in very little or no costs that qualify for capitalization 
we historically used a detailed program design model to measure technological feasibility for our enterprise financial products 
this shift in development of our product lines will result in lower capitalized costs in the future 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries of administrative  executive and financial personnel and outside professional fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased million or from to primarily as a result of a decrease of million in the provision for bad debt in our foreign locations of which million recognized in related to one customer in our south african operations  a decrease of million in professional fees  a decrease of million in employee related expenses  a decrease of million of variable compensation expense and a decrease of million of other miscellaneous expenses 
on june   in order to reduce operating costs to better position ourselves in the current market  we eliminated positions in the united states and positions in our foreign operations 
we recorded a charge to operations in the second quarter totaling million related to involuntary termination benefits to be paid to the terminated employees 
approximately million of these restructuring costs have been paid during the remaining liability at december  is million and is expected to be paid in the elimination of the net positions was expected to result in annual savings of approximately million 
additionally  the executive management team reduced their base salaries by and the board of directors waived all cash compensation for the second half of  resulting in a savings of million 
such salary and board fee reductions were reinstated in on june   we eliminated positions in the united states and positions in our foreign operations and recorded a charge to operations totaling approximately million related to involuntary termination benefits which were subsequently paid to the terminated employees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in the second quarter  we expensed approximately million related to a retirement agreement with our former ceo 
the retirement benefits were paid in the first quarter of operating loss operating loss increased from of million for to million for due to a decrease of million in total revenues offset partially by a decrease of million in operating expenses 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was million expense in as compared to million income in mainly as a result of foreign exchange transaction losses of million in as compared to transaction gains of million in income tax benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of  in from one foreign entity 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in from the sale to third parties of certain expiring new jersey state tax net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits 
we cannot be certain that the state of new jersey will continue to allow such sales in the future or  if it did  that sales to third parties could be consummated 
for there was an additional tax benefit of  in one foreign entity 
results of operations as a consequence of the above  we generated a net loss of million in as compared to a net loss of million in compared to revenues total revenues decreased from to due to a decrease in services revenues partially offset by a increase in license fee revenues 
the increase in license fee revenues was mainly due to increases of million in our us operations  primarily resulting from licenses of our new email compliance software  and million in our southeast asia operations resulting from licenses of additional products to existing customers 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in our south african subsidiary which had a large contract in the second quarter of and no similar contract in approximately of our license fee revenues came from licenses of our records compliance management rcm software as compared to approximately in  a reflection of our new market strategy during the past year 
our license fee revenues also included licenses of our newer web based products to our existing customers as well as the license of additional users for previously licensed software 
the decrease in services revenues resulted mainly from a decrease in consulting revenues partially offset by an increase in maintenance fees 
the decrease in services revenues was primarily in the us and australian operations resulting from fewer orders for consulting services related to software upgrades in the installed base and from our strategic shift during the past year to rcm products 
the decrease in the us operations was also the result of the completion in mid of several large enterprise implementation projects and no new similar projects commenced in late the increase in maintenance fees is mainly the result of new license agreements and customary annual increases for existing agreements 
the increase in custom programming was mainly the result of a large contract with one customer

the increase also included an increase of million in variable compensation in the us operations due to a revision in the commission plans for that provided added incentives for the sales employees resulting in higher commissions 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in commission expense in our south african subsidiary which had a large license contract in the second quarter of and no similar contract in research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  and costs of equipment and facilities 
research and development expenses are generally charged to operations as incurred 
however  certain software development costs are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

research and development expenses net of capitalized software development costs increased from to due primarily to an increase of million in salaries and wages and related benefits due mainly to customary annual salary increases and million in temporaries and consultants working on the development of the new rcm products 
the increase was also the result of a decrease in capitalized software development costs of million 
we capitalized software development costs of million and million in and  respectively 
the rate of capitalization of software development costs may fluctuate depending on the mix and stage of development of our research and development projects 
the decrease in capitalized costs during was mainly the result of the completion and general release of projects that we had been capitalizing from prior periods and from a change in the nature of our development efforts for rcm products versus the historical enterprise financial products

restructuring and other costs on june   in order to streamline and reorganize our operations to better meet our long term goals  we eliminated positions in the united states and positions in our foreign operations 
we recorded a charge to operations in the second quarter of totaling approximately million related to involuntary termination benefits to be paid to the terminated employees 
in the third quarter of  we reduced the restructuring charge by approximately million mainly resulting from our decision to retain two people in our foreign operations 
the elimination of the net positions was expected to result in annual savings of approximately million that is being used to enhance the sales  marketing and research and development functions related to our rcm product strategy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the restructuring charges  we recognized approximately million in expenses related to a retirement agreement with our former ceo 
the retirement benefit was paid in january operating income loss operating income loss decreased from income of million for to a loss of million for due to a million increase in operating expenses  as described above  which includes restructuring and other costs of million  and a decrease in revenue of million 
other income expense  net other income expense  net was million in as compared to million in mainly as a result of an increase of million in interest income due to higher cash balances during  a decrease of million in interest expense and a foreign exchange gain of million in as compared to a loss of million in interest expense related to the interest on the revolving line of credit and term loan that was fully paid as of march  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income tax benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of million and million in and  respectively  from the sales to third parties of certain expiring new jersey state tax net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits 
we cannot be certain that the state of new jersey will continue to allow such sales in the future or  if it did  that sales to third parties could be consummated 
for there was an additional tax benefit of  in one foreign location 
the sale of new jersey state tax net operating loss carry forwards was partially offset by a  provision for income taxes for one foreign location 
results of operations as a consequence of the above  we generated a net loss of million in as compared to net income of million in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and a working capital deficit of million which included million of deferred revenue 
the increase of the working capital deficit from million at december  is primarily the result of a decrease in cash and decreased accounts receivable offset partially by a decrease in deferred revenue

on august   we entered into a two year loan and security agreement with a different institution which contains a revolving line of credit under which we have available the lesser of million or of eligible accounts  as defined see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on january   we amended the loan and security agreement first loan modification to revise the financial covenant based on ebitda for the six months ended december  we were in compliance with this revised covenant and all other covenants as of december  on march   we further amended the agreement second loan modification in order to set the ebitda and adjusted quick ratio quarterly covenants for we were not in compliance with the ebitda covenant as of june  on september   we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement amended agreement in order to revise certain terms of the agreement including the loan fees  interest on the loan and the financial covenants

our operating activities used cash of million and million in and respectively  and provided cash of million in net cash used by operating activities in is primarily the result of the net loss  a decrease in deferred revenue and decreased accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by non cash depreciation and amortization charges and by a decrease in accounts receivable 
the decrease in deferred revenue is mainly the result of a decrease in long term deferred revenue as twelve months of a two year pre paid maintenance agreement with one large customer have now been substantially recognized as revenue 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses in is mainly due to timing of payments and lower bonus accruals 
the decrease in accounts receivable in  mainly in us operations  is due to lower revenue during the current year as well as better collections from customers in compared to net cash used by operating activities in is primarily the result of the net loss  an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets and a decrease in deferred revenue partially offset by non cash depreciation and amortization charges  the net provision for doubtful accounts and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily the result of the net income  non cash depreciation and amortization charges and an increase in deferred revenue partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and an increase in accounts receivable 
our investing activities used cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively  principally for purchases of equipment and leasehold improvements and for capitalized software development costs 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities from to was mainly the result of a decrease in capitalized software development costs and by a decrease in the purchase of equipment 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities from to was mainly the result of a decrease in capitalized software development costs partially offset by an increase in the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
the increase in cash used in investing activities from to resulted mainly from an increase in capitalized software development costs related primarily to development of the new email compliance software 
our financing activities provided cash of million and million in and respectively  and used cash of million in cash provided by financing activities in and was primarily the result of the net proceeds received from the private placements and the exercise of stock options and warrants during the period 
this was partially offset in by the payment of the remaining balance of the outstanding term loan 
cash used in financing activities for resulted mainly from repayments on the term loan in accordance with the loan agreement as of march   the company has approximately million in cash  including million held by our foreign subsidiaries 
the increase from year end is due to the prepayment of maintenance fees  specifically by one large customer 
the prepayment of maintenance fees by the one large customer will be recorded as service revenue over a three year time period starting in the first quarter of we generated a net loss of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  after generating net income of million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  we experienced a decline in revenue as our business has shifted to focus more heavily on the records compliance management business 
management s initiatives over the last two years  including the june and restructurings and the april and june private placements of common stock have been designed to improve operating results and liquidity and better position axs one to compete under current market conditions 
as a result of these efforts  we expect that our current cash balance  availability of borrowing capacity under our bank line of credit and operating cash flow should be sufficient to meet the short term requirements of the business 
our ability to fund our operations for the next twelve months is heavily dependent on the growth of our revenues over levels 
additionally  there is a risk that cash held by our foreign subsidiaries may not be readily available for use in our us operations to pay our obligations as the transfer of funds is sometimes delayed due to various foreign government restrictions 
accordingly  we may in the future be required to seek new sources of financing or future accommodations from our existing lender or other financial institutions  or we may seek equity infusions from private investors 
we may also be required to further reduce operating costs in order to meet our obligations 
we have successfully reduced costs in prior years and believe that we would be successful if additional costs reductions were necessary to help fund our operations 
no assurance can be given that management s initiatives will be successful or that any such additional sources of financing  lender accommodations or equity infusions will be available

capitalized software development costs 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from two sources i software licenses and ii services and support revenue  which includes software maintenance  subscription services  training  consulting and custom programming revenue 
we also derive a limited amount of consulting revenue and directors fees from the related party joint venture in south africa less than of total revenue in  and 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we normally license our software products on a perpetual basis 
each license agreement generally includes a provision for initial post contract support maintenance 
for the majority of license sales we use a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for maintenance fees  we use a maintenance agreement as evidence of the arrangement 
we use a professional services agreement as evidence of an arrangement for our training  subscription  custom programming and consulting revenues 
occasionally  where a master license or services agreement with a customer already exists  we accept the customer s purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
director fee revenues from our joint venture are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  and statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenue from non cancelable software licenses is recognized when the license agreement has been signed  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
the company recognizes revenue from resellers when an end user has placed an order with the reseller and the above revenue recognition criteria have been met with respect to the reseller 
in multiple element arrangements  we defer the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe related to the undelivered elements and recognize revenue on the delivered elements using the residual method 
the most commonly deferred elements are initial maintenance and consulting services 
initial maintenance is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial maintenance term 
the vsoe of maintenance is determined by using a consistent percentage of maintenance fee to license fee based on renewal rates 
maintenance fees in subsequent years are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the applicable agreement 
maintenance contracts entitle the customer to hot line support and all unspecified product upgrades released during the term of the maintenance contract 
upgrades include any and all unspecified patches or releases related to a licensed software product 
maintenance does not include implementation services to install these upgrades 
the vsoe of services is determined by using an average consulting rate per hour for consulting services sold separately multiplied by the estimate of hours required to complete the consulting engagement 
delivery of software generally occurs when the product on cds is delivered to a common carrier 
occasionally  delivery occurs through electronic means where the software is made available through our secure ftp file transfer protocol site 
the company does not offer any customers or resellers a right of return 
for software license  services and maintenance revenue  we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is probable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
the majority of our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates 
we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
however  when we enter into an arrangement that is based on a fixed fee or requires us to perform significant work either to alter the underlying software or to build additional complex interfaces so that the software performs as the customer requests  we recognize the related revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this would apply to our custom programming services  which are generally contracted on a fixed fee basis 
anticipated losses  if any  are charged to operations in the period such losses are determined to be probable 
revenues from transaction fees associated with our subscription arrangements  billable on a per transaction basis and included in services revenue on the consolidated statements of operations  are recognized based on the actual number of transactions processed during the period 
revenues from joint ventures included in revenues other related parties in our consolidated statements of operations includes consulting revenue for the joint ventures use of our south african subsidiary s consultants and directors fees during the period only in accordance with the joint venture agreement 
revenue is recognized upon performance of the services 
we assess assuredness of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earliest of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
capitalized software development costs our policy is to capitalize certain software development costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas 
under sfas  costs incurred to develop or significantly enhance computer software products are charged to research and development expense as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
we establish technological feasibility upon completion of a working model or completion of a detailed program design 
generally costs related to projects that reach technological feasibility upon completion of a working model are not capitalized as the time period between establishment of the working model and general availability is of short duration 
for projects that meet technological feasibility upon completion of a detailed program design  all research and development costs for that project are capitalized from that point until the product is available for general release to customers 
the nature of our current development for rcm products is generally such that we can measure technological feasibility most effectively using the working model method where the time between establishment of a working model and general availability is of short duration which results in very little or no costs that qualify for capitalization 
we historically used a detailed program design model to measure technological feasibility for our enterprise financial products 
this shift in development of our product lines will result in lower capitalized costs in the future 
the establishment of technological feasibility and the ongoing assessment of recoverability of capitalized software development costs require considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  anticipated future revenues  estimated economic life and changes in technology 
it is reasonably possible that estimates of anticipated future revenues  the remaining estimated economic life of the products  or both will be reduced in the future due to competitive pressures 
as a result  the carrying amount of the capitalized software costs may be reduced through a charge to operations in the near term 
upon the general release of the software product to customers  capitalization ceases and such costs are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated life  which is generally three years 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas no 
r addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and non vested stock grants  to be recognized as a compensation cost based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r no later than january  under sfas no 
r  we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share based payments  the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption 
the company expects to adopt the modified prospective method of transition  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and non vested stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of sfas no 
r based on the fair value of the awards determined at the date of grant 
on october   the board of directors of the company approved the acceleration of vesting of all unvested out of the money stock options previously awarded to current employees and directors under the company s stock option plans 
the accelerated options had exercise prices ranging from to with a weighted average exercise price of 
options to purchase approximately million shares became exercisable immediately as a result of the vesting acceleration 
to avoid any unintended personal benefits  the company also imposed a holding period on the shares underlying the accelerated options in the form of a resale restriction agreement 
this agreement requires all optionees to refrain from selling any shares acquired upon the exercise of the accelerated options until the earlier of the date such shares would have vested under the options original vesting terms or the date of the employee s or director s termination from the company 
as a result of this acceleration  the company expects to reduce the stock compensation expense it otherwise would have been required to record beginning in january upon adoption of sfas r by approximately million over approximately years 
in making the decision to accelerate these options  the board of directors considered the interests of the company s stockholders as this acceleration will reduce compensation expense in future periods 
the company expects expense of approximately million for the year ended december  related to the adoption of sfas r based on the unvested options outstanding at december  the company anticipates it will grant additional employee stock options and or non vested stock units in the fair value of these grants is not included in the amount above  as the impact of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the number of share based payments granted and the then current fair values 
on december   the fasb issued statement no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
statement no 
addresses the measurement of exchanges of non monetary assets and redefines the scope of transactions that should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the statement is effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe adoption of statement no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on december   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of the american jobs creation act introduces a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer repatriation provision  provided certain criteria are met 
fas provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision 
fas is effective immediately  though the treasury department or congress is expected to provide additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision 
the adoption of fas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as we do not currently have foreign earnings available for repatriation
