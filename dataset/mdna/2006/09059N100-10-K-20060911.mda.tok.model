item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included under item of this annual report on form k  which are presented beginning at page f summary of critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was released by the sec  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  financial reporting release no 
was released by the sec  which requires all companies to include a discussion to address  among other things  liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following discussion is intended to supplement the summary of significant accounting policies as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended june  included under item in this annual report on form k  which are presented beginning at page f these policies were selected because they represent the critical accounting policies and methods that are broadly applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  upfront nonrefundable fees associated with research and development collaboration agreements where the company has continuing involvement in the agreement  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated research and development period using the straight line method 
if the estimated period is subsequently modified  the period over which the up front fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis using the straight line method 
continuation of certain contracts and grants are dependent upon the company and or its co development partners achieving specific contractual milestones  however  none of the payments received to date are refundable regardless of the outcome of the project 
upfront nonrefundable fees associated with licensing arrangements are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the term of the licensing arrangement using the straight line method  which approximates the life of the last to expire of the underlying patents 
royalty revenue from product licensees is recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  the goods have been delivered and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company currently sells its products to wholesale distributors and directly to hospitals  clinics  and retail pharmacies 
revenue from product sales is recognized when the risk of loss is passed to the customer  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
research and development contract revenue includes sales in our pre commercial stage named patient program for evoltra r as well as certain payments due from our co development partner relating to the reimbursement of for certain of our ongoing research costs in the development of evoltra r outside the united states 
the company follows the guidance of emerging issues task force  or etif   reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent in the presentation of revenues and direct costs of revenues 
this guidance requires the company to assess whether it acts as a principal in the transaction or as an agent acting on behalf of others 
the company records revenue transactions gross in its statements of operations if it is deemed the principal in the transaction  which includes being the primary obligor and having the risks and rewards of ownership 
stock based compensation on july   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r  requiring the company to recognize expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation 
the modified prospective transition method was used as allowed under sfas r 
under this method  the stock based compensation expense includes a compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and b compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company had accounted for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  as permitted by sfas under apb opinion no 
 no stock based employee compensation cost was reflected in reported net loss  when options granted to employees have an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant 
we utilize the black scholes model to measure the value of an employee option 
the black scholes model is a trading options pricing model that neither considers the non traded nature of employee stock options  nor the restrictions on such trading  the lack of transferability or the ability of employees to forfeit the options prior to expiry 
if the model adequately permitted consideration of the unique characteristics of employee stock options  the resulting estimate of the fair value of the stock options could be different 
our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the black scholes model 
the key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events 
we determine expected volatility based on historical activity 
we believe that these market based inputs provide a better estimate of our future stock price movements 
we also use historical exercise patterns as our best estimate of future exercise patterns 
we utilize historical turnover rates in estimating expected forfeitures separately for executives and non executives 
impairment of long lived assets we believe that the accounting estimate relating to impairment of our intangible assets involves a critical accounting estimation methodology 
the estimate is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions about future revenue  operating costs and development expenditures 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the intangible asset impairment estimation process include the timing and amount of projected future cash flows  the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows  and the competitive trends impacting the asset  including consideration of any technical  legal  regulatory  or economic barriers to entry as well as expected changes in standard of practice for indications addressed by the asset 
changes in events or circumstances that may affect long lived assets  particularly in the pharmaceutical industry  makes judgments and assumptions with respect to the future cash flows highly subjective and may include  but are not limited to  cancellations or terminations of license agreements or the risk of competition that could render our products noncompetitive or obsolete 
overview and company status we are a product oriented biopharmaceutical company primarily focused upon the acquisition  development  distribution and marketing of compounds and technologies for the treatment of cancer  autoimmune disease and infection 
our product pipeline includes evoltra r clofarabine  modrenal r for which bioenvision has obtained regulatory approval for marketing in the united kingdom for the treatment of post menopausal breast cancer following relapse to initial hormone therapy  and certain anti infective technologies including the oligon r technology  an advanced biomaterial that has been incorporated into various fda approved medical devices and suvus tm  an antimicrobial agent currently in clinical development for refractory chronic hepatitis c infection 
evoltra r is our lead product 
in may the european medicines agency approved evoltra r for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia all in pediatric patients who have relapsed or are refractory to at least two prior regimens 
the licensed indication includes patients who were less than years of age at the time of initial diagnosis of their leukemia 
evoltra r has been granted orphan drug designation  providing marketing exclusivity for years in europe  which year period commenced in may upon our receipt of ema marketing approval 
we have a dedicated sales force in the uk and several other countries within the eu and will continue to expand our sales force as we continue to work through pricing and reimbursement in individual countries within the eu in march  we entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with mayne pharma limited  a public company in australia  to sell  market and distribute evoltra r clofarabine in australia and new zealand in certain cancer indications 
we anticipate entering into similar arrangements with other marketing and distribution partner s around the world outside north america to capitalize on the commercial potential of evoltra r clofarabine  with a fully integrated sales and marketing team being a primary focus for the sales and marketing partner s we may select at any time or from time to time 
we also are developing evoltra r for the treatment of adult acute myeloid leukemia aml as first line therapy 
the company has completed enrollment of its phase ii clinical trial for the treatment of adult aml in elderly patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy and expects to file a marketing authorization application in for this indication the company s first label extension for evoltra r 
also  in conjunction with our north american co development partners  genzyme corporation  clofarabine evoltra r is in clinical development for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome mds  chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll  chronic myeloid leukemia cml  non hodgkin s lymphoma nhl  multiple myeloma mm  solid tumors and as a preconditioning regimen for transplantation 
bioenvision is also conducting late stage preclinical development of evoltra r for the treatment of psoriasis and is planning further worldwide development of evoltra r in autoimmune diseases 
bioenvision holds an exclusive worldwide license for clofarabine outside japan and southeast asia and an exclusive  irrevocable option to develop  market and distribute clofarabine for all human applications in japan and southeast asia 
bioenvision granted an exclusive sublicense to genzyme to co develop clofarabine for cancer indications in the us and canada 
genzyme is commercializing clofarabine for certain cancer indications in the us and canada under the brand name clolar r 
bioenvision holds an exclusive license in the us and canada for all non cancer indications 
bioenvision originally obtained clofarabine development and commercialization rights under patents held by southern research institute 
in the us  in december  the food and drug administration  or fda  approved clofarabine  for the treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia  or all  in patients who are relapsed or refractory to at least two prior regimens of treatment 
we believe clofarabine was the first new medicine initially approved in the us  for children with leukemia in more than a decade 
our us partner  genzyme corporation  received orphan drug designation status for clofarabine in the us  providing marketing exclusivity for years 
genzyme is marketing clofarabine under the brand name clolar r in the us we are marketing our second product  modrenal r  in the united kingdom  or uk  through our sales force of six sales specialists 
modrenal r is approved in the uk for the treatment of post menopausal advanced breast cancer following relapse to initial hormone therapy 
with the approval of evoltra r under the ema s centralized process  we intend to continue to expand our sales force by adding six to sales specialists in each of five other key regions within the eu either directly or through a sales agent or marketing and distribution partner s which include the countries of france  germany  italy  spain  portugal  netherlands  austria  belgium  denmark and sweden 
further  we intend to penetrate all of the other markets within the eu upon establishing traction in the eu s major markets 
initially  outside the uk  we maintain a fully dedicated sales force through innovex  an affiliate of quintiles limited  which we intend to convert to a direct sales force of our own by fourth quarter calendar in addition to evoltra r and modrenal r  we are currently in clinical development of suvus r for chronic hepatitis c 
this product is also in pre clinical development for the treatment of west nile virus and influenza 
over the next months  we intend to continue our internal growth strategy to provide the necessary regulatory  sales and marketing capabilities which will be required to pursue the expanded development programs described above 
we have made significant progress in developing our product portfolio over the past twelve months  and have multiple products in clinical trials 
we have incurred losses during this early stage of our operations 
we anticipate that revenues derived from evoltra r will permit us to further develop the other products currently in our product pipeline 
in addition to clofarabine and modrenal r  we are performing development work suvus tm for the treatment of hepatitis c 
the work to date on these compounds has been limited because of the need to concentrate on evoltra r  but management believes these compounds have potential value 
with suvus tm the company has commenced a phase ii clinical trial in patients with hepatitis c viral infection 
we have had discussions with potential product co development partners from time to time  and plan to continue to explore the possibilities for co development and sub licensing in order to implement our development plans 
in addition  we believe that some of our products may have applications in treating non cancer conditions in humans and in animals 
those conditions are outside our core business focus and we do not presently intend to devote a substantial portion of our resources to addressing those conditions 
in may  we entered into a license and sub license agreement with dechra pharmaceuticals  plc  or dechra  pursuant to which we sub licensed the marketing and development rights to vetoryl r trilostane  solely with respect to animal health applications  in the us and canada  to dechra 
we received million in cash  together with future milestone and royalty payments which are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events 
we intend to continue to try and capitalize on these types of opportunities as they arise 
the company also owns rights to oligon r technology and we have had discussions with potential product licensing partners from time to time  and plan to continue to explore the possibilities for co development and sub licensing in order to implement our development plans 
you should consider the likelihood of our future success to be highly speculative in light of our limited operating history  as well as the limited resources  problems  expenses  risks and complications frequently encountered by similarly situated companies 
to address these risks  we must  among other things o satisfy our future capital requirements for the implementation of our business plan  o commercialize our existing products  o complete development of products presently in our pipeline and obtain necessary regulatory approvals for use  o implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy to commercialize products  o establish and maintain our client base  o continue to develop new products and upgrade our existing products  o continue to establish and maintain relationships with manufacturers for our products  o respond to industry and competitive developments  and o attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel 
we may not be successful in addressing these or any risks associated with our business and or products 
if we were unable to do so  our business prospects  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the development cycles of new pharmaceutical products and technologies and the competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate 
results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  we reported revenues of approximately  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  this increase was primarily an increase in royalties from us sales of clofarabine of approximately  and named patient reimbursements of approximately  for sales of evoltra tm 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in research and development contract revenue of approximately  as the company did not record revenue for the year ended june   related to the reimbursement from our co development partner for certain of our ongoing research costs in the development of evoltra tm outside the united states because it determined that the criteria for recognizing such contract revenue had not been met 
if and when the company determines that collectibility is reasonably assured  the company will record the revenue 
the cost of products sold for years ended june  and june  was approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  the cost of products sold reflects the direct costs associated with our commercial sales and royalties due on the sale of our lead products of approximately  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
research and development costs for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  our research and development costs include costs associated with the six projects shown in the table below  five of which the company currently devotes time and resources in thousands product change evoltra r   modrenal r   suvus tm velostan oligon r gene therapy total   evoltra r research and development costs for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  the increase primarily reflects costs which are associated with our increased development activities and clinical trials of evoltra r being conducted in europe which includes the filing process for eu approval coupled with recording stock based compensation expense  relating to stock options granted to employees that devote their time to clofarabine research and development 
modrenal r research and development costs for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  this increase is due primarily to the costs associated with our phase ii clinical trial in pre menopausal cancer and phase iv clinical trial in patients with post menopausal cancer  which are each being conducted in the uk 
suvus tm research and development costs for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  the increase primarily reflects the costs associated with the ongoing  multi center investigator sponsored phase ii clinical trial being conducted in egypt during the twelve months ended june  and costs associated with the preparation of an ind application to be filed with fda 
velostan research and development costs for the years ended june  and were approximately and  respectively  representing a decrease of approximately  there were no research and development costs associated with velostan for the year ended june  because our third party vendors must develop a manufacturing process to create a raceamic form of the compound for use in the company s clinical development program in order for us to continue our development activities with this compound 
no assurance can be given the company will be able to create the l form velostan required for the clinical development program or  if it can  the timing of such development 
oligon r research and development costs for the years ended june  and were and  respectively  representing a decrease of  our continued lack of devoted resource to develop this compound reflects our continued emphasis on the development of evoltra r during this period 
the clinical trials and development strategy for the evoltra r and modrenal r projects  in each case  is anticipated to cost several million dollars and will continue for several years based on the number of clinical indications within which we plan to develop these drugs 
currently  management cannot estimate the timing or costs associated with these projects because many of the variables  such as interaction with regulatory authorities and response rates in various clinical trials  are not predictable 
total costs to date for each of our projects is as follows i evoltra r research and development costs have been approximately  ii modrenal r research and development costs have been approximately  iii velostan research and development costs have been approximately  iv suvus tm research and development costs have been approximately  v oligon r research and development costs have been approximately  and vi gene therapy research and development costs have been approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  this increase primarily is due to o an increase of approximately  in employee stock based compensation expense a non cash item primarily due to the company s adoption of sfas r on july  and the extension of the exercise period of  vested options originally granted to an officer of the company from five to ten years  o an increase in sales and marketing costs of approximately  related to the company s development of a sales and marketing force in europe  o an increase in payroll due to the significant increase in employee headcount in both new york and edinburgh offices of approximately o an increase of approximately  due to an increase in insurance premiums paid by the company

provision for bad debts for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing a decrease of approximately  the decrease is due to the company recording a valuation allowance relating to certain of the outstanding receivable balances from our co development partner totaling  in the prior year 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  we reported revenues of approximately  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  this increase primarily was due to an increase in license and royalty revenue from milestone payments and royalties received from certain of our co development partners in the amount of approximately  an increase in research and development contract revenue due to increased sales in the named patient program  increased reimbursements from genzyme related to clofarabine research and development expenses  in the amount of approximately  and revenue from the sale of modrenal r of approximately  the cost of products sold for years ended june  and june  were approximately  and  respectively 
the cost of products sold reflects the direct costs associated with our sales of modrenal r and royalties due on the sale of our lead products of approximately  research and development costs for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  our research and development costs include costs associated with the six projects shown in the table below  five of which the company currently devotes time and resources in thousands product change evoltra r    modrenal r   suvus tm velostan oligon r gene therapy total    evoltra r research and development costs for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  the increase primarily reflects costs which are associated with our increased development activities and clinical trials of evoltra r being conducted in europe  certain of which are partially reimbursed by genzyme 
modrenal r research and development costs for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing a decrease of approximately  the decrease primarily reflects the company s primary focus on evoltra r during this period 
suvus tm research and development costs for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  the increase primarily reflects the costs associated with the ongoing  multi center investigator sponsored phase ii clinical trial being conducted in egypt and southern europe during the year ended june  velostan research and development costs for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing a decrease of approximately  the decrease primarily reflects the company s primary focus on evoltra r during this period 
oligon research and development costs for the years ended june  and were  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  the increase primarily reflects pre development costs incurred in connection with continuing co partnering discussions 
the clinical trials and development strategy for the evoltra r and modrenal r projects  in each case  is anticipated to cost several million dollars and will continue for several years based on the number of clinical indications within which we plan to develop these drugs 
currently  management cannot estimate the timing or costs associated with these projects because many of the variables  such as interaction with regulatory authorities and response rates in various clinical trials  are not predictable 
total costs to date for each of our projects is as follows i evoltra r research and development costs have been approximately  ii modrenal r research and development costs have been approximately  iii velostan research and development costs have been approximately  iv suvus tm research and development costs have been approximately  v oligon research and development costs have been approximately  and vi gene therapy research and development costs have been approximately  selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  this increase primarily is due to o an increase in payroll due to the significant increase in employee headcount in both new york and edinburgh offices of approximately o an increase in consulting and legal fees due to the company s expansion of regulatory and investor relations initiatives  and the restatement of the company s financial statements included in the company s annual report on form ksb  in the amount of o an increase in sales and marketing costs of approximately  related to the company s development of a sales and marketing force in the uk  o an increase of approximately  due to an increase in the company s annual rent expense  and o an increase of approximately  due to an increase in insurance premiums paid by the company 
these increases are substantially offset by a decrease in costs associated with the variable accounting treatment of options issued to an officer of the company in the amount of approximately  depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  this increase primarily reflects the corresponding increase in our net asset base 
provision for bad debts for the years ended june  and were approximately  and  respectively 
the increase is due to the company recording a valuation allowance relating to certain of the outstanding receivable balances from our co development partner totaling  in the current year 
management believes the amounts billed to its co development partner and previously recorded as revenue through march  are supportable and continues to actively pursue collection of the outstanding balances 
during its quarterly closing process the company further evaluated the collectibility of such amounts and concluded that based upon the available information a valuation allowance was required 
additionally  based on the delay in payment from our co development partner and other information  management concluded that collectibility was no longer reasonably assured and therefore  did not recognize revenue on amounts billed in the quarter ended june  prior to the fourth quarter of  we tested for impairment our methylene blue intangibles acquired in connection with the pathagon acquisition and determined that  based on our assumptions  the sum of the expected future cash flows  undiscounted and pertaining solely and exclusively to approved indications  exceeded the carrying value of its long lived assets and therefore we did not recognize an impairment 
due to the loss of an intellectual property patent suit relating to the international use of methylene blue in fresh frozen plasma  we re evaluated the intangible asset relating to methylene blue at june  at that date  we estimated that our undiscounted future cash flows  again relating solely and exclusively to approved uses of methylene blue  were less than the carrying value 
as a result  we recognized a non cash impairment loss of  equal to the difference between the estimated future cash flows for approved uses of methylene blue  discounted at an appropriate rate  and the carrying amount of the asset 
making the impairment determination and the amount of impairment requires significant judgment by management and assumptions with respect to the future cash flows 
changes in events or circumstances that may affect long lived assets makes judgments and assumptions with respect to the future cash flows highly subjective 
the company has been incurring losses since inception and therefore has not recorded an income tax provision for the years ended june  and the company has recorded a deferred income tax benefit of approximately and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance as to whether or when we will generate material revenue or achieve profitable operations 
on june   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  short term securities of  and working capital of  management believes the company has sufficient cash and cash equivalents  short term securities and working capital to continue currently planned operations through june  however  we may need additional financing to continue to fund the research and development and marketing programs for our products and to generally expand and grow our business 
because we will be required to fund additional operating losses in the foreseeable future  our financial position will continue to deteriorate 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to find financing in the future or  if found  such funding may not be on terms favorable to us 
if adequate financing is not available  we may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate some of our research and development programs  to relinquish rights to certain technologies or products  or to license third parties to commercialize technologies or products that we would otherwise seek to develop 
any inability to obtain additional financing  if required  would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our operations and implement our business plan 
although we do not currently plan to acquire or obtain licenses for new technologies  if any such opportunity arises and our board deems it to be in our interests to pursue such an opportunity  it is possible that additional financing would be required for such a purpose 
for the fiscal year ended june  and  net cash used in operating activities was approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  this increase is primarily due to increased costs associated with i our expanded research and development activity  ii selling general and administrative expenses  including an increase in costs associated with the expanded sales and marketing and administrative infrastructure and costs associated with the internal build out of the company and iii cash paid for insurance premiums 
for the fiscal year ended june  and  net cash used in investing activities was approximately  and  respectively  representing a decrease of approximately  this decrease is primarily due to the company investing the proceeds from our february secondary offering in short term securities in the fiscal year ended june  in order to obtain a higher investment yield 
for the fiscal year ended june  and  net cash provided by financing activities was approximately  and  representing a decrease of  this decrease is primarily due to the completion of the secondary public offering in february which yielded net proceeds of approximately  for the fiscal years ended june  and  net cash used in operating activities was approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of approximately  this increase is primarily due to increased costs associated with i our expanded research and development activity  with evoltra r specifically  ii selling general and administrative expenses  including an increase in costs associated with the expanded sales and marketing and administrative infrastructure and costs associated with the internal build out of the company and iii cash paid for insurance premiums

the company has the following commitments due over the next five years payments due in operating leases     contractual obligations  total     the contractual obligations relate to minimum payments due for research conducted on modrenal 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes that a company should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
in may  the fasb issued sfas accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion and sfas sfas changes the accounting for  and reporting of  a change in accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior period s financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle  and changes required by new accounting standards when the standard does not include specific transition provisions  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections made in fiscal years beginning after december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our excess cash is invested in certificates of deposit with various short term maturities 
we hold no derivative financial instruments and we do not currently engage in hedging activities 
as of june   we do not have any outstanding debt 
accordingly  due to the maturity and credit quality of our investments  we are not subjected to any substantial risk arising from changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and commodity and equity prices 
however  the company does have some exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations arising from maintaining an office for the company s uk based  wholly owned subsidiary which transacts business in the local functional currency 
management periodically reviews such foreign currency risk and to date has not undertaken any foreign currency hedges through the use of forward exchange contracts or options and does not foresee doing so in the near future
