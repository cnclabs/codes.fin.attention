the increase in the america s revenues was negatively impacted by the client driven migration of call volumes from the united states to comparable or higher margin offshore operations  including latin america and the asia pacific rim  and the resulting mix shift in revenues from the united states to offshore each offshore seat generates roughly half the revenue dollar equivalence of a us seat 
revenues from our offshore operations represented of consolidated revenues in compared to in the trend of generating more of our revenues from new and existing client programs in offshore operations could continue in while operating margins generated offshore are generally comparable or higher than those in the united states  our ability to maintain these offshore operating margins longer term is difficult to predict due to potential increased competition for the available workforce and costs of functional currency fluctuations in offshore markets

table of contents differences  valuation allowances  foreign withholding taxes  state income taxes  and foreign income tax rate differentials including tax holiday jurisdictions

this reversal resulted from a favorable change in forecasted and book income for one emea legal entity  which provided sufficient evidence for current and future sources of taxable income

while the average offshore revenue per seat is less  the operating margins generated offshore are generally comparable or higher than those in the united states 
however  our ability to maintain these offshore operating margins longer term is difficult to predict due to potential increased competition for the available workforce in offshore markets 
the increase in emea s revenue of million  or  for was primarily related to the strengthening euro  which positively impacted revenues for by approximately million compared to the euro in excluding this foreign currency benefit  emea s revenues would have increased million compared with last year reflecting an improvement in certain customer call volumes and higher incentive payments related to quality operating performance

this 
table of contents decrease was due to lower direct and indirect salaries and related benefits primarily attributable to an overall reduction in us customer call volumes 
this decrease was offset by higher telephone costs related to transporting calls offshore  higher staffing and training costs associated with the ramp up offshore and certain duplicative costs as we simultaneously ramped down us customer contact management centers  termination costs related to the consolidation of two european customer contact management centers and higher claim costs associated with our automotive program in canada related to higher fuel costs and the severe canada winter

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
we utilize these capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our customer contact management services  invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including repurchase of our common stock in the open market and to fund possible acquisitions 
in future periods  we intend similar uses of these funds 
on august   the board of directors authorized the company to purchase up to three million shares of our outstanding common stock 
a total of million shares have been repurchased under this program since inception 
the shares are purchased  from time to time  through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions  and the purchases are based on factors  including but not limited to  the stock price and general market conditions 
during the year ended december   we did not repurchase common shares under the repurchase program 
during the year ended december   we generated million in cash from operating activities and received million in cash from issuance of stock and million in cash from the sale of facilities  property and equipment 
further  we used million in funds for capital expenditures  million to purchase the stock of kelly  luttmer associates limited  million to purchase investments and million to repay long term debt resulting in a million increase in available cash including the unfavorable effects of international currency exchange rates on cash of million 
net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  were million  compared to net cash flows provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the million increase in net cash flows from operating activities was due to an increase in net income of million  a million net change in assets and liabilities and a million increase in non cash reconciling items such as deferred income taxes and a net gain on disposal of property and equipment 
this million net change in assets and liabilities was principally a result of a million decrease in receivables  a million increase in deferred revenue  a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in accrued employee compensation  and a million increase in other liabilities offset by a million increase in other assets and a million decrease in taxes payable 
capital expenditures  which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our credit facilities  were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  which was driven primarily by lower investments in offshore facilities 
during the year ended december   approximately of the capital expenditures were the result of investing in new and existing customer contact management centers  primarily offshore  and was expended primarily for maintenance and systems infrastructure 
in  we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of million to million 
an available source of future cash flows from financing activities is from borrowings under our million revolving credit facility the credit facility  which amount is subject to certain borrowing limitations 
pursuant to the terms of the credit facility  the amount of million may be increased up to a maximum of million with the prior written consent of the lenders 
the million credit facility includes a million swingline subfacility  a million letter of credit subfacility and a million multi currency subfacility 
the credit facility  which includes certain financial covenants  may be used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions  share repurchases  working capital support  and letters of credit  subject to certain limitations 
the credit facility  including the multi currency subfacility  accrues interest  at our option  at a the base rate defined as the higher of the lender s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus plus an applicable margin up to  or b the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin up to 
borrowings under the swingline subfacility accrue interest at the prime rate plus an applicable margin up to and borrowings under the letter of credit subfacility accrue interest at the libor plus an applicable margin up to 
in addition  a commitment fee of up to is charged on the unused portion of the credit facility on a quarterly basis 
the borrowings under the credit facility  which will terminate on march   are secured by a pledge of of the stock of each of our active direct foreign subsidiaries 
the credit facility prohibits us from incurring additional indebtedness  subject to certain specific exclusions 
there were no borrowings in and and no 
table of contents outstanding balances as of december  and with million availability under the credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the credit facility 
at december   we had million in cash  of which approximately million was held in international operations and may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the united states 
on october  the president signed the american jobs creation act of the act 
the act created a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the incentive was only available in and was subject to a number of limitations 
based on a cost benefit analysis  the company decided not to repatriate any foreign income under the act 
we believe that our current cash levels  accessible funds under our credit facilities and cash flows from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs  future debt repayment requirements if any  continued expansion objectives  anticipated levels of capital expenditures and contractual obligations for the foreseeable future and stock repurchases 
off balance sheet arrangements and other at december   we did not have any material commercial commitments  including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations  or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
from time to time  during the normal course of business  we may make certain indemnities  commitments and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions 
these include  but are not limited to i indemnities to clients  vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct and ii indemnities involving breach of contract  the accuracy of representations and warranties  or other liabilities assumed by us in certain contracts 
in addition  we have agreements whereby we will indemnify certain officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is  or was  serving at our request in such capacity 
the indemnification period covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited  however  we have director and officer insurance coverage that limits our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe the applicable insurance coverage is generally adequate to cover any estimated potential liability under these indemnification agreements 
the majority of these indemnities  commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential for future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and other guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we have some client contracts that do not contain contractual provisions for the limitation of liability  and other client contracts that contain agreed upon exceptions to limitation of liability 
we have not recorded any liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets with respect to any client contracts under which we have or may have unlimited liability 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than total year years years after years operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations amounts represent the expected cash payments of our operating leases as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
other long term liabilities  which exclude deferred income taxes  represent the expected cash payments due minority shareholders of certain subsidiaries and others 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results we recognize revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards  including sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  sab  revenue recognition and the emerging issues task force eitf no 
 eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
sab  as amended  and sab summarize certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provide guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry 
eitf provides further guidance on how to account for multiple element contracts 
we recognize revenue from services as the services are performed under a fully executed contractual agreement and record reductions to revenue for contractual penalties and holdbacks for failure to meet specified minimum service levels and other performance based contingencies 
royalty revenue is recognized when a contract has been fully executed  the product has been delivered or provided  the license fees or rights are fixed and determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is probable and there are no other contingencies 
revisions to these estimates  which could result in adjustments to fixed price contracts and estimated losses  are recorded in the period when such adjustments or losses are known or can be reasonably estimated 
product sales are recognized upon shipment to the customer and satisfaction of all obligations 
we recognize revenue from licenses of our software products and rights when the agreement has been executed  the product or right has been delivered or provided  collectibility is probable and the software license fees or rights are fixed and determinable 
if any portion of the license fees or rights is subject to forfeiture  refund or other contractual contingencies  we defer revenue recognition until these contingencies have been resolved 
revenue from support and maintenance activities is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
table of contents and the unrecognized portion is recorded as deferred revenue 
certain contracts to sell our products and services contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  we evaluate each contract to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements and the timing of revenue recognition for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client acceptance are resolved  and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
once we determine the allocation of revenue between deliverable elements  there are no further changes in the revenue allocation 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts of million as of december   or of receivables  for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would reduce income from operations 
we reduce deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence for each respective tax jurisdiction  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance for a particular tax jurisdiction is allocated between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets for that jurisdiction on a pro rata basis 
available evidence which is considered in determining the amount of valuation allowance required includes  but is not limited to  our estimate of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies 
at december   management determined that a valuation allowance of approximately million was necessary to reduce us deferred tax assets by million and foreign deferred tax assets by million  where it was more likely than not that some portion or all of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of the remaining net deferred tax asset of million at december  is dependent upon future profitability within each tax jurisdiction 
as of december   based on our estimates of future taxable income and any applicable tax planning strategies within various tax jurisdictions  we believe that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax asset will be realized 
see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we review long lived assets  which had a carrying value of million as of december   including goodwill  intangibles and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable and at least annually for impairment testing of goodwill 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
upon determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired  we would record an impairment charge or loss to reduce the asset to its fair value 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and  therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  share based payment which revises sfas and supersedes apb and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires companies to recognize in their income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees and directors 
we adopted sfas r on january  the standard requires that compensation expense for most equity based awards be recognized over the requisite service period  usually the vesting period  while compensation expense for liability based awards those usually settled in cash rather than stock be re measured to fair value at each balance sheet date until the award is settled 
under sfas r  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
the adoption of sfas r is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows as most outstanding options were fully vested as of december  we use the black scholes formula to estimate the value of stock based compensation granted to employees and directors and expect to continue to use this option valuation model in  but may consider switching to another model in the future  if we determine that such model will produce a better estimate of fair value 
because sfas r must be applied not only to new awards  but to previously granted awards that are not fully vested on january   the effective date of sfas r  compensation cost for some previously granted options will be recognized under sfas r 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of this standard would have 
table of contents approximated the impact described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per share in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as previously required 
we will use the modified prospective method  which requires us to record compensation expense for the non vested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding at the initial date of adoption and to record compensation expense for any awards issued or modified after january  in march  the sec issued sab sab  share based payments  which provides guidance on valuation methods available and guidance on other related matters in applying the provisions of sfas r 
we adopted the provisions of sab in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r on january  in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas no 
r sfas r  practical accommodation to the application of grant date as defined in fas r 
sfas r provides guidance on the application of grant date as defined in sfas r 
in accordance with this standard  a grant date of an award exists if a the award is a unilateral grant and b the key terms and conditions of the award are expected to be communicated to an individual recipient within a relatively short time period from the date of approval

r sfas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
sfas r provides an elective alternative method that establishes a computational component to arrive at the beginning balance of the accumulated paid in capital pool related to employee compensation and a simplified method to determine the subsequent impact on the accumulated paid in capital pool of employee awards that are fully vested and outstanding upon the adoption of sfas r on january  we are currently evaluating the use of this transition method

fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations that requires an entity to recognize a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability can be reasonably estimated 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity

sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle and redefines the term restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
under retrospective application  the new accounting principle is applied as of the beginning of the first period presented as if that principle had always been used

sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  in july  the fasb issued an exposure draft of a proposed interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes entitled accounting for uncertain tax positions 
the proposed interpretation stipulates that the benefit from a tax position should be recorded only when it is probable that the tax position will be sustained upon audit by taxing authorities  based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
the final issuance of this proposed interpretation  which may be subject to significant changes  will be no earlier than the first quarter of and the effective date has not been determined 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this proposed standard on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in non us currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to non us exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  those results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
movements in non us currency exchange rates may affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
periodically  we use foreign currency contracts to hedge intercompany receivables and payables  and transactions initiated in the united states that are denominated in foreign currency 
the principal foreign currency hedged is the euro using foreign currency contracts ranging in periods from one to three months 
foreign currency contracts are accounted for on a mark to market basis  with realized and unrealized gains or losses recognized in the current period  as we do not designate our foreign currency contracts as accounting hedges 
unrealized and realized gains or losses related to these contracts for the three years ended december  were immaterial 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from variable debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
based on our level of variable rate debt outstanding during the year ended december   a one point increase in the weighted average interest rate  which generally equals the libor rate plus an applicable margin  would not have had a material impact on our annual interest expense 

table of contents at december   we had no debt outstanding at variable interest rates 
we have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates
