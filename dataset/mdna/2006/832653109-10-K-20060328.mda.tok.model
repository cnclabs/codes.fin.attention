item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risk  assumptions  and uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
words such as believe  may  could  expects  likely  variations of these words  and similar expressions  are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below in the section entitled risk factors  as well as those discussed in this item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
business overview we are a truckload carrier that provides nationwide transportation of diversified freight  concentrating primarily on the flatbed segment of the truckload market 
we offer comprehensive truckload transportation services to shippers located predominantly between the rocky mountains in the west and the appalachian mountains in the east  and in the southern provinces of canada 
beginning in and continuing through most of  truckload carriers operated in a very difficult business environment 
a combination of high fuel prices  rising insurance premiums  tightened credit standards  a depressed used truck market  a declining number of independent contractors  and slowing freight demand associated with an economic downturn affected the profitability of many trucking companies  including our company 
in addition to these general industry factors  the impact of the economic downturn on our customer base was particularly severe  resulting in a more pronounced weakening in our freight demand than that experienced by truckload carriers generally 
during that period  several customers experienced economic difficulties  some of which declared bankruptcy 
beginning in the last half of and continuing today  our industry has begun to feel the positive effects of an increase in freight demand and general economic improvement 
in the second quarter of  we began to implement a plan designed to return smithway to profitability by achieving a more streamlined and efficient operation 
our return to profitability in and continued profitability in is a testament to the positive impact of that plan 
average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenues  our main measure of asset productivity  improved  to  in from  in  as we increased miles per tractor  reduced non revenue miles  and reduced the number of tractors without drivers 
in addition  we reduced our fixed costs of terminals  equipment  and non driving personnel  although these savings were partially offset by higher maintenance and fuel costs per mile 
the net result was an improvement of basis points in our operating ratio  to in from in revenues and expenses we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile for our services 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  and other accessorial services 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate  among other things  to the united states economy  inventory levels  the level of capacity in the trucking industry  specific customer demand  and driver availability 
we monitor our revenue production primarily through average revenue per tractor per week 
in  our average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenues increased to  from  in our operating revenue increased million  to million in from million in  while weighted average tractors increased to  in from  in our ending fleet size grew by units to  units at december  compared to  units at december  the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which are recorded under purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and financing of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and the compensation of non driver personnel 
effectively controlling our expenses has been a key component of our profit improvement plan 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to revenue for the periods indicated operating revenue operating expenses purchased transportation compensation and employee benefits 
fuel  supplies  and maintenance insurance and claims taxes and licenses general and administrative communication and utilities gain on disposal of assets depreciation and amortization total operating expenses earnings loss from operations interest expense  net other income loss earnings before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss earnings comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue increased million to million in from million in the increase in operating revenue resulted from increased average operating revenue per tractor per week and a increase in our weighted average tractors 
operating revenue  excluding fuel surcharge revenue of million  increased million to million in from million  excluding fuel surcharge revenue of million  in operating revenue in  excluding fuel surcharge revenue of million  brokerage revenue of million  and other revenue of million  was million 
operating revenue in  excluding fuel surcharge revenue of million  brokerage revenue of million  and other revenue of  was million 
average operating revenue per tractor per week increased significantly to  in from  in operating revenue includes revenue from operating our trucks as well as other  more volatile  revenue items  including fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue 
we believe the analysis of tractor productivity is more meaningful if fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue are excluded from the computation 
average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue increased to  in from  in  primarily due to increased production from our seated equipment 
for the year  revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue increased to in from in fuel surcharge revenue increased million to million in from million in during and  approximately million and million  respectively  of the fuel surcharge revenue collected helped to offset our fuel costs 
the remainder was passed through to independent contractors 
our weighted average tractors increased to  in from  in reflecting an increase in the number of independent contractor providers of equipment 
purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation increased to in from in the changes reflect higher pay to independent contractors resulting from increases in fuel surcharge revenue and average revenue per billed mile  an increase in the number of independent contractors and in the percentage of the fleet supplied by independent contractors  and higher payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
the percentage of total operating revenue provided by independent contractors increased to in from in we believe we are one of the few companies providing an environment to increase our independent contractor fleet  which grew nearly in during the last half of  we leased new tractors under operating leases 
payments under operating leases  a component of purchased transportation  increased million  to million in from  in if the leased tractors would have been purchased  instead of leased  we would have incurred a similar amount of depreciation and interest expense in lieu of purchased transportation expense 
compensation and employee benefits increased million to million in from million in reflecting increases in the number of company drivers and their rate of pay  and increases in non driver employee wages  partially offset by decreased health insurance costs 
as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits decreased to in from in  reflecting the changes described above and an increase in our revenue per loaded mile and fuel surcharge revenue  which increases revenue without a proportionate increase in wages 
our ratio of tractors to non driver employees  a key measure of administrative efficiency  has improved to during compared to during the market for recruiting drivers continues to be challenging 
we have increased driver pay three times since the third quarter of and expect that further increases will be necessary 
future increases in driver pay would negatively impact our results of operations to the extent that corresponding freight rate increases are not obtained 
fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased to of revenue in compared with in this reflects higher fuel prices  partially offset by an increase in our average revenue per loaded mile  which increases revenue without a corresponding increase in fuel  supplies  and maintenance costs 
maintenance costs have stabilized as we continue to update our fleet with new equipment 
fuel prices  however  increased approximately to an average of per gallon in from per gallon in the per gallon increase in fuel prices was partially offset by a per gallon million increase in fuel surcharge revenue attributable to company owned tractors which is included in operating revenue  mitigating of the increase in fuel prices 
insurance and claims increased million to million in from million in  primarily due to additional premiums paid for our reinstated excess insurance coverage 
as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims remained constant at of revenue in both years 
this reflects a reduction in the cost of auto liability  physical damage  and cargo claims and an increase in our average revenue per loaded mile  which increases revenue without a corresponding increase in insurance and claims costs  partially offset by premiums paid for our reinstated excess insurance coverage 
on february   we reinstated excess insurance coverage that we had discontinued in july the additional insurance  which increases our per claim coverage from million to million  added million to our insurance and claims expense during claims that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  or claims for which coverage is not provided  may cause our financial condition and results of operations to suffer a materially adverse effect 
the insurance policies were renewed on july  with no change in our retention levels 
taxes and licenses decreased  to million in from million in increases related to the increase in the number of company owned tractors subject to annual license and permit costs were more than offset by reduced over dimensional permit costs and lower real estate taxes of  resulting from a successful appeal of the assessed value on one of our locations 
as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses decreased to of revenue in compared with of revenue in  reflecting the items noted above and an increase in our revenue per loaded mile and fuel surcharge revenue which increases revenue without a proportionate increase in taxes and licenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  to million in from million in  primarily due to increased professional fees related to sarbanes oxley compliance efforts and driver recruiting and orientation expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenue in compared with in  reflecting an increase in our revenue per loaded mile and fuel surcharge revenue which increases revenue without a proportionate increase in general and administrative expenses 
communications and utilities decreased  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities decreased to of revenue in compared with of revenue in  reflecting an increase in our revenue per loaded mile and fuel surcharge revenue which increases revenue without a proportionate increase in communications and utilities expenses 
gains on the disposal of assets increased million to million in from  in as a percentage of revenue  gains on the disposal of assets increased to of revenue in compared with in the increase in gains is primarily attributable to the sale of used trailers 
prior to  very few trailers had been replaced 
as we replace our trailer fleet over the next several years we expect gains to continue at or near levels  assuming consistent market conditions for used equipment 
depreciation and amortization decreased million to million in from million in  reflecting the acquisition during of new tractors under operating leases 
payments under operating leases are a component of purchased transportation 
if the leased tractors would have been purchased  instead of leased  approximately million of depreciation expense would have been incurred in in lieu of purchased transportation expense 
also  some of our older equipment still generates revenue but is no longer being depreciated 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to of revenue in compared with in  reflecting the changes described above and an increase in our average revenue per loaded mile and fuel surcharge revenue which increases revenue without a proportionate increase in depreciation expense 
as we continue to upgrade our equipment fleet  we expect depreciation expense to increase 
interest expense  net  increased  to million in from million in this increase was attributable to higher average debt outstanding and higher interest rates 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net  remained relatively constant at of revenue in compared with in during  we recorded  of income from life insurance proceeds 
this non operating income is tax exempt and added to our earnings per share for this was a one time event that did not recur in and will not recur in the future 
as a result of the foregoing  our pre tax margin increased to in from in our income tax expense in was million  or of earnings before income taxes 
our income tax expense in was million  or of earnings before life insurance proceeds and income taxes 
in both years  the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by us 
the impact of paying per diem travel expenses varies depending upon the ratio of drivers to independent contractors and the level of our pre tax earnings or loss 
as a result of the factors described above  net earnings were million in of revenue  compared with million in of revenue 
without the life insurance proceeds of  our net earnings would have been million of revenue in the period 
in addition  our operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was during as compared with during our operating ratio  excluding fuel surcharge revenue  was during as compared with during comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue increased million to million in from million in the increase in operating revenue resulted from increased average operating revenue per tractor per week and an increase in fuel surcharge revenue  offset partially by a reduction in our weighted average tractors 
operating revenue  excluding fuel surcharge revenue  increased million to million in from million in operating revenue in  excluding fuel surcharge revenue of million  brokerage revenue of million  and other revenue of  was million 
average operating revenue per tractor per week increased significantly to  in from  in operating revenue includes revenue from operating our trucks as well as other  more volatile  revenue items  including fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue 
we believe the analysis of tractor productivity is more meaningful if fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue are excluded from the computation 
average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue increased to  in from  in  primarily due to increased production from our seated equipment and a lower number of unseated company tractors 
for the year  revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge  brokerage  and other revenue increased to in from in fuel surcharge revenue increased million to million in from million in during and  approximately million and million  respectively  of the fuel surcharge revenue collected helped to offset our fuel costs 
the remainder was passed through to independent contractors 
our weighted average tractors decreased to  in from  in this reflects our planned reduction in fleet size implemented during which reduced the number of unmanned company owned tractors 
in addition  we contracted with a declining number of independent contractor providers of equipment throughout purchased transportation consists primarily of payments to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment  expenses related to brokerage activities  and payments under operating leases of revenue equipment 
purchased transportation increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  purchased transportation decreased to in from in the changes reflect a decrease in the number of independent contractors throughout and in the percentage of the fleet supplied by independent contractors 
the percentage of total operating revenue provided by independent contractors decreased to in from in we believe the decline in independent contractors as a percentage of our total fleet was attributable to high fuel costs  high insurance costs  tighter credit standards  and slow freight demand  which diminished the pool of drivers interested in becoming or remaining independent contractors 
the decline in the number of independent contractors slowed significantly near the end of as freight demand and the general economy improved 
during  our number of independent contractors slowly increased 
compensation and employee benefits increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  compensation and employee benefits decreased to in from in  reflecting an increase in our revenue per loaded mile and fuel surcharge revenue which increases revenue without a proportionate increase in wages 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in the percentage of the fleet comprised of company owned tractors and an increase in drivers pay rate  which was raised approximately two cents per mile on august  finally  increases in health care costs continued to negatively impact our health insurance and workers compensation expense 
fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  fuel  supplies  and maintenance increased to of revenue in compared with in this reflects higher fuel prices and an increase in the percentage of the fleet comprised of company owned tractors  partially offset by an increase in our rate per loaded mile which increases revenue without a corresponding increase in maintenance costs 
fuel prices increased approximately to an average of per gallon in from per gallon in the per gallon increase in fuel prices was partially offset by a per gallon million increase in fuel surcharge revenue attributable to company owned tractors which is included in operating revenue  mitigating of the increase in fuel prices 
insurance and claims increased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  insurance and claims increased to of revenue in compared with in during  we exercised an option to retroactively increase the deductible for our auto liability policy to  per incident beginning july  through june  which reduced our expense by  this did not recur in generally  higher insurance premiums and claims were partially offset by the elimination of premiums for excess insurance coverage which we discontinued in july  due to our financial condition and the rising cost of insurance  leaving million of primary coverage with a  self insured retention 
taxes and licenses increased  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  taxes and licenses decreased to of revenue in compared with of revenue in  reflecting an increase in our revenue per loaded mile and fuel surcharge revenue which increases revenue without a proportionate increase in taxes and licenses 
general and administrative expenses remained constant at million in and as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenue in compared with in  reflecting an increase in our revenue per loaded mile and fuel surcharge revenue which increases revenue without a proportionate increase in general and administrative expenses 
communications and utilities decreased  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  communications and utilities decreased to of revenue in compared with of revenue in  reflecting an increase in our revenue per loaded mile and fuel surcharge revenue which increases revenue without a proportionate increase in communications and utilities expenses 
gains on the disposal of assets increased  to  in from  in as a percentage of revenue  gains on the disposal of assets decreased to of revenue in compared with in depreciation and amortization decreased million to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization decreased to of revenue in compared with in  partly due to increased average revenue per tractor and reduction of unseated tractors  which more efficiently spreads depreciation expense 
additionally  some of our older equipment still generated revenue but was no longer being depreciated 
interest expense  net  decreased  to million in from million in this decrease was attributable to lower average debt outstanding  partially offset by higher interest rates 
as a percentage of revenue  interest expense  net  decreased to of revenue in compared with in during  we recorded  of income from life insurance resulting from the death of william g 
smith  our former president and chief executive officer 
this non operating income is tax exempt and added to our earnings per share for this was a one time event that will not recur in the future 
as a result of the foregoing  our pre tax margin increased to in from in our income tax expense in was million  or of earnings before life insurance proceeds and income taxes 
our income tax benefit in was million  or of loss before income taxes 
in both years  the effective tax rate is different from the expected combined tax rate for a company headquartered in iowa because of the cost of nondeductible driver per diem expense absorbed by us 
the impact of paying per diem travel expenses varies depending upon the ratio of drivers to independent contractors and the level of our pre tax earnings or loss 
as a result of the factors described above  net earnings were million in of revenue  compared with a net loss of million in of revenue 
without the life insurance proceeds of  our net earnings would have been million of revenue in the period 
in addition  our operating ratio operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was during as compared with during our operating ratio  excluding fuel surcharge revenue  was during as compared with during liquidity and capital resources uses and sources of cash we require cash to fund working capital requirements and to service our debt 
we have historically financed acquisitions of new equipment with borrowings under installment notes payable to commercial lending institutions and equipment manufacturers  borrowings under lines of credit  cash flow from operations  and equipment leases from third party lessors 
we also have obtained a portion of our revenue equipment fleet from independent contractors who own and operate the equipment  which reduces overall capital expenditure requirements compared with providing a fleet of entirely company owned equipment 
our primary sources of liquidity have been funds provided by operations and borrowings under credit arrangements with financial institutions and equipment manufacturers 
we are experiencing improved cash flow as we have returned to profitability 
as of the date of this report  we have adequate borrowing availability on our line of credit to finance any near term needs for working capital 
we had positive working capital of  on december  and million on december  working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  is not always fully representative of our liquidity position because cash and trade receivables account for a large portion of our current assets 
our trade accounts receivable are generally collected within days 
alternatively  current maturities of long term debt  a large portion of our current liabilities  are paid over one year 
our ability to fund cash requirements in future periods will depend on our ability to comply with covenants contained in financing arrangements and the availability of other financing options  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
our financial condition and results of operations will depend on insurance and claims experience  general shipping demand by our customers  fuel prices  the availability of drivers and independent contractors  continued success in implementing the profit improvement plan described above  and other factors 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that cash generated by operations and available sources of financing for acquisitions of revenue equipment will be adequate to meet our currently anticipated working capital requirements and other cash needs through we will require additional sources of financing over the long term to upgrade our tractor and trailer fleets 
to the extent that actual results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may be unable to meet our financial covenants 
specifically  our short and long term liquidity may be adversely affected by one or more of the following factors costs associated with insurance and claims  weak freight demand or a loss in customer relationships or volume  the impact of new hours of service regulations on asset productivity  the ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified drivers and independent contractors  elevated fuel prices and the ability to collect fuel surcharges  inability to maintain compliance with  or negotiate amendments to  loan covenants  the ability to finance the tractors and trailers delivered and scheduled for delivery  and the possibility of shortened payment terms by our suppliers and vendors worried about our ability to meet payment obligations 
based upon our improving results  anticipated future cash flows  current availability under our financing arrangement with lasalle bank  and sources of equipment financing that are available  we do not expect to experience significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
to the extent that actual results or events differ from our financial projections or business plans  our liquidity may be adversely affected and we may be unable to meet our financial covenants 
in such event  we believe we could renegotiate the terms of our debt or that alternative financing would be available  although this cannot be assured 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
historically  our principal use of cash is to service debt and to internally finance acquisitions of revenue equipment 
total receivables increased  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the average age of our trade accounts receivable was approximately days for  days for  and days for net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
such amounts related primarily to purchases and sales of revenue equipment 
net cash used in financing activities of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  consisted primarily of net payments of principal under our long term debt agreements 
we have a financing arrangement with lasalle bank  which expires on october   and provides for automatic month to month renewals under certain conditions after that date 
lasalle bank may terminate the arrangement prior to october   in the event of default  and may terminate at the end of any renewal term 
the agreement provides for a revolving line of credit which allows for borrowings up to of eligible receivables 
at december   total borrowings under the revolving line were  the financing arrangement also includes financing for letters of credit 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million for self insured amounts under our insurance programs 
we are required to pay an annual fee of of the outstanding letters of credit 
these letters of credit directly reduce the amount of potential borrowings available under the financing arrangement discussed above 
any increase in self insured retention  as well as increases in claim reserves  may require additional letters of credit to be posted  which would negatively affect our liquidity 
the combination of borrowings under the line of credit and outstanding letters of credit with lasalle bank cannot exceed the lower of million or a specified borrowing base  which at december  was million  leaving million in remaining availability at such date 
we are required to pay a facility fee on the lasalle bank s financing arrangement of 
of the unused loan limit 
borrowings under the arrangement are secured by accounts receivable 
the interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the arrangement is equal to a spread on lasalle bank s prime rate or libor  at our option 
the spread is determined by our ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rent  or ebitdar  as defined under the agreement 
at december  the applicable interest rate under the arrangement was equal to the prime rate minus basis points 
the lasalle bank financing arrangement requires compliance with certain financial covenants  including compliance with a minimum tangible net worth  debt to ebitdar  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with these requirements at december  we believe we will maintain compliance with all covenants throughout  although there can be no assurance that the required financial performance will be achieved 
in addition  equipment financing provided by a manufacturer contains a minimum tangible net worth requirement 
we were in compliance with the required minimum tangible net worth requirement for december  and we expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
if we fail to maintain compliance with these financial covenants  or to obtain a waiver of any noncompliance  the lenders will have the right to declare all sums immediately due and pursue other remedies 
in this event  we believe we could renegotiate the terms of our debt or that alternative financing would be available  although this cannot be assured 
as of the filing date  we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables set forth the contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments in thousands due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt     operating lease obligations    purchase obligations total     in our normal course of business we place orders with equipment manufacturers for future delivery of new tractors and trailers 
the orders for trailers can be cancelled at any time without penalty prior to taking delivery 
the orders for tractors can be cancelled without penalty at any time up to days prior to production of the tractor 
if the termination occurs less than days  but more than days  prior to production  we retain the right to cancel subject to a minimal per truck penalty of orders generally cannot be cancelled within days prior to production 
at december   we had commercial commitments of approximately  related to tractor orders that cannot be cancelled 
approximately of our long term debt carries a variable interest rate making reliable estimates of future interest payments difficult 
using our weighted average interest rate of as of december   the following approximately represents our expected obligations for future interest payments interest payments in thousands due by period less than more than total year years years years total interest payments    we had no other commercial commitments at december  off balance sheet arrangements our liquidity is not materially affected by off balance sheet transactions 
during the last six months of we leased new tractors under operating leases 
these new leases will increase equipment rent expense  a component of purchased transportation expense  in future periods 
our obligations under non cancelable operating lease agreements are as follows  million   million   million      thereafter  these obligations exclude potential terminal remainder adjustment clause trac payments or refunds on tractors amounting to of the original purchase price due at the end of the original month term of the lease 
after months  we expect the residual value of the tractors to be greater than of the original cost  allowing us to return the tractors without penalty 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors we consider as relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable accounting principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which impact reported amounts and disclosures 
changes in future economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of our estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in preparation of the financial statements is contained in note of the consolidated financial statements attached hereto 
other footnotes describe various elements of the financial statements and the assumptions on which specific amounts were determined 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we generally recognize operating revenue when the freight to be transported has been loaded 
we operate primarily in the short to medium length haul category of the trucking industry  therefore  our typical customer delivery is completed one day after pickup 
accordingly  this method of revenue recognition is not materially different from recognizing revenue based on completion of delivery 
we recognize operating revenue when the freight is delivered for longer haul loads where delivery is completed more than one day after pickup 
amounts payable to independent contractors for purchased transportation  to company drivers for wages  and other direct expenses are accrued when the related revenue is recognized 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided by use of the straight line and declining balance methods over lives of to years for buildings and improvements  years for tractors  years for trailers  and to years for other equipment 
tires purchased as part of revenue equipment are capitalized as a cost of the equipment 
replacement tires are expensed when placed in service 
expenditures for maintenance and minor repairs are charged to operations  and expenditures for major replacements and betterments are capitalized 
the cost and related accumulated depreciation on property and equipment retired  traded  or sold are eliminated from the property accounts at the time of retirement  trade  or sale 
the gain or loss on retirement or sale is included in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operation 
gains on trade ins are included in the basis of the new asset 
judgments concerning salvage values and useful lives can have a significant impact 
estimated liability for insurance claims losses resulting from auto liability  physical damage  workers compensation  and cargo loss and damage are covered by insurance subject to certain self retention levels 
losses resulting from uninsured claims are recognized when such losses are incurred 
we estimate and accrue a liability for our share of ultimate settlements using all available information 
we accrue for claims reported  as well as for claims incurred but not reported  based upon our past experience 
expenses depend on actual loss experience and changes in estimates of settlement amounts for open claims which have not been fully resolved 
however  final settlement of these claims could differ materially from the amounts we have accrued at year end 
our judgment concerning the ultimate cost of claims and modification of initial reserved amounts is an important part of establishing claims reserves  and is of increasing significance with higher self insured retention and lack of excess coverage 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
our judgment concerning future cash flows is an important part of this determination 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
this statement sfas r is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related implementation guidance 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services through share based payment transactions 
sfas r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
sfas r is effective for our company on january  we will adopt sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  we will recognize compensation cost for share based payments to our employees based on their grant date fair value from the beginning of measurement and attribution of compensation cost for awards that were granted prior to  but not vested as of december   will be based on the same estimate of the grant date fair value used previously under sfas no 
for pro forma disclosure purposes 
for those awards that are granted  modified or settled after december   compensation cost will be measured and recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
for periods prior to adoption  the financial statements will remain unchanged 
accordingly  pro forma disclosures will not be necessary for periods after the adoption of the new standard 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
statement establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to a newly adopted accounting principle 
this statement will be effective for our company for all accounting changes and any error corrections occurring after january  in march  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations that requires conditional asset retirement obligations to be recognized if a legal obligation exists to perform asset retirement activities and a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the obligation can be made 
fin also provides guidance as to when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
we adopted the provisions of fin on december  and recorded conditional asset retirement obligations of  inflation and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operation 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices  the compensation paid to drivers  and fuel prices 
innovations in equipment technology and comfort have resulted in higher tractor prices  and there has been an industry wide increase in wages paid to attract and retain qualified drivers 
we attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and certain cost control efforts 
the failure to obtain rate increases in the future could adversely affect profitability 
high fuel prices also decrease our profitability 
most of our contracts with customers contain fuel surcharge provisions 
although we attempt to pass through increases in fuel prices to customers in the form of surcharges and higher rates  the fuel price increases are not fully recovered 
seasonality in the trucking industry results of operations show a seasonal pattern because customers generally reduce shipments during the winter season  and we experience some seasonality due to the open  flatbed nature of the majority of our trailers 
we at times have experienced delays in meeting shipment schedules as a result of severe weather conditions  particularly during the winter months 
in addition  our operating expenses have been higher in the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs in colder weather 
risk factors we may from time to time make written or oral forward looking statements 
written forward looking statements may appear in documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  in press releases  and in reports to stockholders 
the private securities litigation reform act of contains a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
we rely on this safe harbor in making such disclosures 
in connection with this safe harbor provision  we hereby identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement made by us or on our behalf 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  the following the transportation industry is affected by business risks that are largely out of our control  any of which could significantly reduce our operating margins and income 
our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include excess capacity in the transportation industry  significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates  insurance and claims costs  tolls  license and registration fees  declines in the resale value of used equipment and the cost of healthcare for our employees  to the extent that the negative impact of these factors is not offset by increases in freight rates or fuel surcharges 
our results of operations also are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in geographic areas  market segments and industries in which we have a concentration of customers 
our results of operations are also affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments during the winter months 
rapid changes in fuel costs and potential changes in fuel taxes could impact our financial results 
fuel and fuel taxes currently represent of our operating expenses 
fuel prices have continued to rise throughout  and shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
we are subject to risk with respect to purchases of fuel 
prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political  economic  and market factors that are generally outside our control 
political events in the middle east  venezuela  and elsewhere and hurricanes  and other weather related events  also may cause the price of fuel to increase 
because our operations are dependent upon diesel fuel  significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition if we are unable to pass increased costs on to customers through rate increases or fuel surcharges 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of short term increases in fuel prices from customers through fuel surcharges 
fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset the increase in the cost of diesel fuel 
to the extent we are not successful in these negotiations  our results or operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  we incur additional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or out of route miles that cannot be billed to customers 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
from time to time  various legislative proposals are introduced to increase federal  state  or local taxes  including taxes on motor fuels 
we cannot predict whether  or in what form  any increase in such taxes that impact us will be enacted and  if enacted  whether or not our independent contractors would attempt to pass the increase on to us or whether we will be able to reflect this potential increased cost of capacity  if any  in prices to customers 
moreover  competition from other transportation service companies including those that provide non trucking modes of transportation and intermodal transportation would likely increase if federal or state taxes on fuel were to increase without a corresponding increase in taxes imposed upon other modes of transportation 
seasonality and the impact of weather affect our operations and profitability 
our tractor productivity decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations  and some shippers reduce their shipments after the winter holiday season 
revenue can also be affected by bad weather and holidays  since revenue is directly related to available working days of shippers 
at the same time  operating expenses increase and fuel efficiency declines because of engine idling and harsh weather which creates higher accident frequency  increased claims  and more equipment repairs 
we can also suffer short term impacts from weather related events such as hurricanes  blizzards  ice storms  and floods that could harm our results or make our results more volatile 
we will have significant ongoing capital requirements that could reduce our income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations 
the trucking industry is very capital intensive 
historically  we have depended on cash from operations  equipment financing  and debt financing for funds to update our revenue equipment fleet 
beginning in  we began to upgrade our tractor fleet 
going forward we will need to continue to upgrade our tractor and trailer fleets 
we expect to pay for the projected capital expenditures and or operating leases with cash flows from operations and borrowings from equipment manufacturers or under the financing arrangement with lasalle bank 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms in the future  we may have to enter into less favorable financing arrangements or operate our revenue equipment for longer periods  any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability 
increased prices  reduced productivity  and restricted availability of new revenue equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows 
going forward  as we continue to upgrade our equipment fleet  we expect depreciation and or equipment rent expense  a component of purchased transportation expense  to increase 
prices for new tractors have been increasing over the past few years  and we expect this trend to continue  partially as a result of government regulations applicable to newly manufactured tractors and diesel engines  in addition to higher commodity prices and better pricing power among equipment manufacturers 
more restrictive emissions standards for will require vendors to introduce new engines 
as a result  we expect to continue to pay increased prices for equipment and incur additional expenses and related financing costs for the foreseeable future 
if revenue production were to decrease  the increased depreciation and or rent could have a materially adverse effect on operating results 
furthermore  new engines after are expected to reduce equipment productivity and lower fuel mileage and  therefore  increase our operating expenses 
in addition  a decreased demand for used revenue equipment could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we rely on the sale and trade in of used revenue equipment to offset the cost of new revenue equipment 
the demand for used revenue equipment is currently stable 
however  a reversal of this trend could result in lower market values 
this would increase our capital expenditures for new revenue equipment and increase our maintenance costs if management decides to extend the use of revenue equipment in a depressed market 
difficulty in attracting drivers and independent contractors could affect our profitability and ability to grow 
competition for drivers and independent contractors is intense in the trucking industry 
there is  and historically has been  an industry wide shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors which has been particularly severe during the past few years 
the number of independent contractors has decreased industry wide for a variety of economic reasons 
our independent contractors are responsible for paying their own equipment  fuel and other operating costs  and significant increases in these costs could cause them to seek higher compensation from us or seek other opportunities within or outside the trucking industry 
furthermore  competition for drivers continues to increase 
if a shortage of drivers should continue  or if we are unable to recruit additional drivers and independent contractors  this could force us to increase compensation or limit fleet size  either of which could have a materially adverse effect on operating results 
we operate in a highly competitive industry  and our business will suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other factors that may adversely affect our operations and significantly reduce our operating margins and income 
numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability 
these factors include the following we compete with many other transportation service providers including other truckload carriers  private fleets operated by existing and potential customers  and to some extent railroads and railroad intermodal service  some of which have a lower cost structure  more equipment and greater capital resources than we do or have other competitive advantages 
some of our competitors periodically reduce their prices to gain business  especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy  which limits our ability to maintain or increase prices or maintain significant growth in our business 
our customers may negotiate rates or contracts that minimize or eliminate our ability to continue to hedge fuel price increases through a fuel surcharge on our customers 
many customers reduce the number of carriers they use by selecting so called core carriers as approved transportation service providers  and in some instances we may not be selected 
many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs  and this process may depress prices or result in the loss of some business to competitors 
the trend towards consolidation in the ground transportation industry may continue to create larger carriers with greater financial resources and other competitive advantages relating to their size 
advances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive  and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments 
ongoing insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our income 
our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels  which could significantly reduce our earnings 
if the number or severity of claims for which we are self insured increases  our earnings could be significantly reduced 
we currently self insure for a portion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss  personal injury  property damage and workers compensation and a portion of employee health insurance 
our limited amount of excess coverage and high self insured retention increases our risk associated with the frequency and severity of accidents and could increase our expenses or make them more volatile from period to period 
furthermore  if we experience claims that exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  or if we experience claims for which coverage is not provided  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer a materially adverse effect 
in february  we reinstated excess insurance coverage for losses above our primary policy limit of million up to million 
the cost of this excess insurance to provide protection against unusually large claims will increase our insurance premiums in the future 
furthermore  insurance carriers have recently raised premiums for most trucking companies 
as a result  our insurance and claims expenses could increase when some of our current coverages expire in june if these expenses increase  and we are unable to offset the increase with higher rates  our earnings could be materially and adversely impacted 
we operate in a highly regulated industry  and costs of compliance with  or liability for violation of  existing or future regulations could significantly increase our costs of doing business 
the us department of transportation and various state and federal agencies exercise broad powers over our business  generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations and safety 
effective october   driver hours of service regulations were revised 
the majority of these rule changes had initially been effective in january in general  the new rules are likely to create a moderate reduction in the amount of time available to drivers in longer lengths of haul  which could reduce equipment productivity in those lanes 
the federal motor carrier safety administration is studying rules relating to braking distance and on board data recorders that could result in new rules being proposed 
we are unable to predict the effect of any proposed rules  but we expect that any proposed rules would increase costs in our industry  and the on board data recorders potentially could decrease productivity and the number of people interested in being drivers 
the us environmental protection agency epa recently adopted new emissions control regulations  which require progressive reductions in exhaust emissions from diesel engines through  for engines manufactured in october and thereafter 
in part to offset the costs of compliance with the new epa engine design requirements  some manufacturers have significantly increased new equipment prices and eliminated or sharply reduced the price of repurchase or trade in commitments 
if new equipment prices were to increase  or if the price of repurchase commitments by equipment manufacturers were to decrease  more than anticipated  we may be required to increase our depreciating and financing costs or retain some of our equipment longer  with a resulting increase in maintenance expenses 
to the extent we are unable to offset these increases in expenses with rate increases or cost savings  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
if our fuel or maintenance expenses were to increase as a result of our use of the new  epa compliant engines  and we are unable to offset these increases with fuel surcharges or higher freight rates  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
further  our business and operations could be adversely impacted if we experience problems with the reliability of the new engines 
our management team is an important part of our business and loss of key personnel could impair our success 
we benefit from the leadership and experience of our senior management team and depend on their continued services to successfully implement our business strategy 
we have not entered into employment agreements for a fixed period with members of our current management 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  business or financial condition 
fear of terrorism and the increased costs associated with homeland security may negatively impact our business 
in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on the united states  federal  state and municipal authorities have implemented and are implementing various security measures  including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks 
if the new security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries  we may fail to meet the needs of our customers  or may incur increased expenses to do so 
we cannot assure you that these measures will not significantly increase our costs and reduce our operating margins and income 
in addition  we cannot predict the effects on the economy or consumer confidence of actual or threatened armed conflicts or terrorist attacks  efforts to combat terrorism  military action against a foreign state or group located in a foreign state  or heightened security requirements 
enhanced security measures could impair our operating efficiency and productivity and result in higher operating costs 
we are highly dependent on a few major customers  the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of major customers 
for the year ended december   our top customers accounted for approximately of our revenue 
a reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we are dependent on computer and communications systems  and a systems failure could cause a significant disruption to our business 
our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems and infrastructure 
we currently use a centralized computer network and regular communication to achieve system wide load coordination 
our operations and those of our technology and communications service providers are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist attacks  internet failures  computer viruses  and other events beyond our control 
in the event of a significant system failure  our business could experience significant disruption 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties 
in addition to direct regulation by the us department of transportation and other agencies  we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials  underground fuel storage tanks  and discharge and retention of storm water 
we operate in industrial areas  where truck terminals and other industrial facilities are located  and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred 
our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage  environmental damage  and hazardous waste disposal  among others 
if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances  or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations  we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability 
our business also is subject to the effects of new tractor engine design requirements implemented by the epa such as those that became effective october  and are expected to become effective in which are discussed above under risk factors increased prices for  or increased costs of operating  new revenue equipment may materially and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
additional changes in the laws and regulations governing or impacting our industry could affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by influencing the demand for  and the costs of providing  services to shippers 
some states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel powered tractors  such as ours  may idle  in order to reduce exhaust emissions 
these restrictions could force us to alter our drivers behavior  purchase on board power units that do not require the engine to idle  or face a decrease in productivity 
our independent contractors may be improperly classified  and any changes to their classification costs may increase our operating expenses 
from time to time  various legislative or regulatory proposals are introduced at the federal or state levels to change the status of independent contractors classification to employees for either employment tax purposes withholding  social security  medicare and unemployment taxes or other benefits available to employees 
currently  most individuals are classified as employees or independent contractors for employment tax purposes based on common law factors rather than any definition found in the internal revenue code or internal revenue service regulations 
in addition  under section of the revenue act of  taxpayers that meet certain criteria may treat an individual as an independent contractor for employment tax purposes if they have been audited without being told to treat similarly situated workers as employees  if they have received a ruling from the internal revenue service or a court decision affirming their treatment  or if they are following a long standing recognized practice 
we classify all of our independent contractors and independent commission sales agents as independent contractors for all purposes  including employment tax and employee benefit purposes 
there can be no assurance that legislative  judicial  or regulatory including tax authorities will not introduce proposals or assert interpretations of existing rules and regulations that would change the employee independent contractor classification of independent contractors or independent commission sales agents currently doing business with us 
although we believe that there are no proposals currently pending that would change the employee independent contractor classification of independent contractors or independent commission sales agents currently doing business with the company  the costs associated with potential changes  if any  with respect to these independent contractor classifications could have a material adverse effect on us  including our results of operations and financial condition if we were unable to reflect them in our fee arrangements with the independent contractors or independent commission sales agents or in the prices charged to our customers 
we may not make acquisitions in the future and any acquisitions we do make may fail to achieve desired results 
we have made no acquisitions of companies during the past three years and there is no assurance that we will make acquisitions in the future 
if we fail to make any future acquisitions  our ability to compete in the industry could be negatively affected 
furthermore  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the acquired company s operations  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the risks of entering into markets in which management has no or only limited direct experience  and the potential loss of customers  key employees and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results 
if we make any acquisitions in the future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired companies or assets into our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  most importantly the effects of the price and availability of diesel fuel and changes in interest rates 
commodity price risk our operations are heavily dependent upon the use of diesel fuel 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can vary and are subject to political  economic  and market factors that are beyond our control 
significant increases in diesel fuel prices could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we presently use fuel surcharges to address the risk of increasing fuel prices 
we believe these fuel surcharges are an effective means of mitigating the risk of increasing fuel prices  although the competitive nature of our industry prevents us from recovering the full amount of fuel price increases through the use of such surcharges 
in the past  we have used derivative instruments  including heating oil price swap agreements  to reduce a portion of our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
since we have had no such agreements in place 
we do not trade in such derivatives with the objective of earning financial gains on price fluctuations 
interest rate risk we also are exposed to market risks from changes in certain interest rates on our debt 
our financing arrangements with lasalle bank and some other lenders provide for a variable interest rate 
at december   approximately million of our total debt  or  carried variable interest rates 
this variable interest exposes us to the risk that interest rates may rise 
assuming borrowing levels at december   a one point increase in the prime rate would increase annual interest expense by approximately  the remainder of our other debt carries fixed interest rates
