overview centillium designs  develops and supplies highly integrated programmable system on a chip soc solutions that enable high speed broadband access  which is the delivery of high capacity bandwidth to consumers and enterprises for networking of data  voice and video signals 
our soc products incorporate digital and mixed signal semiconductors and related software 
we serve the digital subscriber line dsl  voice over internet protocol voip and fiber to the premises fttp  which is also known as optical networking  markets 
our customers are systems vendors and original equipment manufacturers who sell dsl and optical network equipment for deployment in central offices and customer premises  and voip equipment  for use in carrier class and enterprise class gateways and consumer telephony 
we currently sell through our direct sales force and through independent sales representatives in the asia pacific region  europe  and north america 
since inception  our net revenues have been derived primarily from the sale of our dsl products to two customers in japan 
these two customers are nec corporation nec and sumitomo electric industries  ltd 
sumitomo 
in compared to  the adsl new subscriber market in japan shrank dramatically  which adversely impacted our financial performance 
in compared to  the adsl new subscriber market shrank further 
as the dsl market continues to approach maturity  we expect that the new subscriber rate in will remain at or be lower than the rate experienced in we have not reported an operating profit for any year since inception and have experienced net losses of approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows in the near term 
we must achieve substantial revenue growth and continue to reduce expenses to improve our financial position 
our ability to achieve the necessary revenue growth will depend on how successful we are in diversifying our dsl business to markets outside of japan and diversifying our business by targeting opportunities in the fttp and voip markets 
during the third quarter of  we announced our entry into the vdsl market with extremevdsl  a highly optimized and flexible solution that will complement our fttp initiative and extend our dsl product portfolio 
in the second quarter of  we announced an expansion to the palladia tm product family  which delivers the industry s first integrated voip solution for the adsl market 
in  we introduced atlanta  which provides a secure high performance router solution for the cpe market with superior voip capability  and our voice services platform vsp  which is designed as the consumer electronics industry s turnkey platform for the development and deployment of carrier grade voip products 
we announced in a line of optical access products for the developing fttp market 
our fttp revenues were million and  in and  respectively 
growth  if any  in our fttp revenues in and beyond is dependent on qualification of our fttp products and the purchase of significant quantities of these products by our customers 
one such customer in japan  which we had expected to account for a significant percentage of this growth  has postponed purchases because our product did not meet a previously waived requirement 
moreover  for this customer  our product must now meet additional requirements and we are in the process of redesigning this product 
this is expected to significantly slow our anticipated growth in optical revenues in we will also incur further costs to implement these customer requirements 
even if we are successful  we expect the delay to defer revenue to as late as the fourth quarter of and possibly beyond 
however  there can be no assurance that our product will meet customer requirements now or in the future and that even if they do meet these requirements  that our customers will purchase our product 
in addition to our expanded product lines  we have also increased our sales and marketing presence outside of japan 
we reduced our operating expenses  primarily in the research and development area 
the investments we made in our design center in india and in attracting talented engineers resulted in our ability to reduce expenses by conducting more of our research and development in india  where costs are substantially lower than in the united states 
in  we recorded total charges of about million for surplus space in a building at our fremont  california location  which we abandoned 
in addition  we recorded a million charge for licensed software tools  which were written off as these tools are not expected to have future alternative uses 
during the fourth quarter of  we restructured our organization by implementing a workforce reduction and terminating a million license for certain software design tools 
we also cancelled certain development programs to better focus on higher growth opportunities 
the total expense related to the reduction in force was million  of which million related to research and development personnel 
these initiatives coupled with a increase in revenues  an increase in the gross margin  as well as further expense reductions resulted in a significant decrease in our net loss for our net loss decreased by approximately million  or  to a net loss of million for as compared to million for our planned actions for are based on certain assumptions concerning the adoption of broadband technologies  the rate of dsl subscriber growth  the successful deployment of our fttp products in japan and the cost and expense structure of our business 
these assumptions could prove to be inaccurate 
if current economic conditions deteriorate to an unexpected degree  or if our planned actions are not successful in achieving our goals  there could be additional adverse impacts on our revenues  profitability  financial position  or cash flows 
in that case  we might need to modify our strategic focus and restructure our business to realign our resources and achieve additional cost and expense savings 
net revenues in  and  dsl revenues accounted for  and of our net revenues  respectively 
in  and  nec accounted for  and and sumitomo accounted for  and of net revenues  respectively 
lucent technologies accounted for of net revenues in no other customer accounted for or more of net revenues in any year during this three year period 
we believe revenues from our dsl products will continue to decrease as a percentage of net revenues due to the anticipated growth in revenues from voip and fttp products 
we believe that our three largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenues in our sales have historically been denominated in us dollars  and major fluctuations in currency and exchange rates could materially impact our customers demand and pricing overall 
the cycle for test  evaluation and adoption of our products by customers can range from three to more than six months  with an additional three to more than nine months before a customer commences volume production of equipment incorporating our products 
additionally  this cycle may be as long as to months for our voip products 
due to this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we incur expenses for research and development  marketing and selling  and investment in inventory  to the time we generate corresponding revenues  if any 
we anticipate that the rate of orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if anticipated shipments in any quarter do not occur when expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high or low  and our results of operations for that quarter  and potentially for future quarters  would be materially and adversely affected 
competition and technological change in the rapidly evolving dsl market has and may continue to influence our quarterly and annual net revenues and results of operations 
average selling prices of our products tend to be higher at the time of introduction and decline over time due to competitive pressures 
we expect this pattern to continue with existing and future products 
our average selling prices are also impacted by our customer concentration and product mix 
cost of revenues we are a fabless semiconductor company and we outsource the wafer fabrication  assembly and testing of our products 
our cost of revenues primarily consists of purchased finished wafers  assembly and test services  royalties  overhead associated with procurement and production engineering  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  and product warranty costs 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and related personnel expenses  fees paid to consultants  non recurring engineering  prototype costs  evaluation and testing of pre production parts and engineering design tools 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  the timing of which can cause significant quarterly variability in our expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include employee compensation and related personnel expenses in sales and marketing  product marketing  applications engineering  and corporate functions including accounting  finance  legal  human resources and information systems 
stock based compensation deferred compensation represents the difference between the grant price and the fair market value for financial statement reporting purposes of our common stock option and restricted stock grants 
as required by apb  we have recorded an adjustment to stock based compensation expense related to employees who forfeited options for which compensation expense had been recognized using the graded vesting method  but which are unvested on the date their employment terminated 
amortization of deferred compensation using the straight line vesting method was  in compared to  in the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition beginning in the first quarter of although centillium has not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  it believes the adoption of fas r will have a material adverse impact on operating results 
interest income and other  net interest income consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalent balances and short term investments 
provision for income taxes the provision for income tax expense was  in   in and  in the provisions for income taxes relate to current taxes payable for income generated by the company s subsidiaries located in foreign jurisdictions 
as of december   we have million and million of net operating loss carryforwards for us federal and state purposes  respectively 
we also have research and development tax credit carryforwards for us federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal net operating losses and federal tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  if not utilized 
the california net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in utilization of net operating loss and credit carry forwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards before full utilization 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and our reported cumulative net losses to date  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because we do not believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that  of the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following are critical accounting policies  which may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition revenues related to product sales are generally recognized when the products have been shipped and risk of loss has passed to the customer  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the price is fixed or determinable 
if sales arrangements contain customer specific acceptance requirements  revenue is deferred and is recognized upon receipt of customer acceptance 
sales returns and allowances we establish  upon shipment of our products  a provision for estimated returns 
under certain circumstances  we allow our customers to return products and a provision is made for such returns 
our estimate of product returns is based on contractual terms or sales agreements  historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
additional provisions and allowances may be required  resulting in decreased net revenue and gross profit  should we experience increased product returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we record allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses based upon specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible 
we record additional allowances based on certain percentages of our aged receivables  which are determined based on historical experience and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required 
we have a limited number of customers with individually large amounts due at any given balance sheet date 
any unanticipated change in one of those customers creditworthiness or other matters affecting the collectibility of amounts due from such customers could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which such changes or events occur 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost  or net realizable value 
cost is based on a first in  first out basis 
we perform detailed reviews of the net realizable value of inventories  both on hand as well as for inventories we are committed to purchase with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence  and other factors 
we typically use a six or nine month rolling forecast based on the type of products  anticipated product orders  product order history  forecasts and backlog 
we compare our current or committed inventory levels to these forecasts on a regular basis and any adverse changes to our future product demand may result in increased writedowns  resulting in decreased gross profit 
in the event we experience unanticipated demand and are able to sell previously written down inventories  gross profit will increase 
warranty a limited warranty is provided on our products generally for a period of one year and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of replacing chipsets  rework costs and freight incurred in replacing a chipset after failure 
we monitor product returns for warranty and maintain a reserve for the related warranty expenses based on historical experience of similar products 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty 
if actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
litigation and contingencies from time to time  we receive various inquiries or claims in connection with patent and other intellectual property rights 
in certain cases  we have accrued estimates of the amounts we expect to pay upon resolution of such matters 
should we not be able to secure the terms we expect or should the terms become more favorable than the terms we expect  these estimates may change and may result in increased accruals  resulting in decreased profit or decreased accruals  resulting in increased profit  respectively 
the above items are not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for our management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k that contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain data from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of acquisition related intangibles total operating expenses operating loss interest income  net loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net loss less than years ended december  and net revenues the following table presents net revenues  cost of revenues and gross profit in thousands except for percentages year ended year ended december  december  of net of net increase amount revenues amount revenues decrease change net revenues    cost of revenues  gross profit  our revenues are generated principally by sales of our dsl  voip and fttp products 
the following table presents net revenues for each of our major product lines in thousands except for percentages  year ended year ended december  december  of net of net increase products amount revenues amount revenues decrease change dsl    voip    fttp  net revenues  net revenues in were million  compared with million in  an increase of million  or 
revenues from our dsl products accounted for million  or  of net revenues in  as compared to  million or  of net revenues in the decline in dsl revenues was primarily due to a significant decrease in the number of new dsl subscribers in japan as compared to  and to a lesser extent  by a decrease in the average selling price of our dsl products 
average selling prices of products are expected to decline as they mature 
historically  competition in the semiconductor industry has driven down the average selling prices of products 
revenues from japan comprised and of our net revenues in and  respectively 
japan s dsl market has been an important part of our business  and new dsl subscribers in japan has been a significant driver of consumption for centillium s dsl products 
therefore  the continuing decreasing number of new dsl subscribers in japan will likely continue to impact our future revenues 
revenues from japan  which have been largely attributable to our dsl products  have decreased by million to million in as compared to million in revenues from voip products accounted for million of revenues in as compared to million in  or and of net revenues  respectively 
we expect our voip revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues in revenues from our fttp products accounted for million of revenues in as compared to  in  or and of net revenues  respectively 
we expect our fttp revenues to continue to grow in  but this growth is highly dependent on qualification of our fttp products and the purchase of significant quantities of these products by our customers 
one such customer in japan has postponed purchases because our product did not meet a previously waived requirement 
this is expected to significantly slow our anticipated growth in optical revenues in and we expect the delay to defer revenue to as late as the fourth quarter of and possibly beyond 
the following customers  the first two of whom are located in japan  accounted for more than of net revenues years ended december  nec sumitomo lucent less than gross profit gross profit represents net revenues less the cost of revenues 
gross profit increased by million  to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to significant increases in voip and fttp revenues as the impact of the decrease in dsl revenues on gross profit was largely offset by lower wafer  assembly and test costs  as well as improved yields and a favorable product mix 
gross profit margin increased to in from in primarily due to the lower costs  improved yields and product mix  which more than offset the decline in the average selling price 
our future gross profit margins may be affected by competitive pricing strategies  fluctuations in unit volume and manufacturing costs  and changes in product and customer mix among other factors 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by to million in from million in the million decrease resulted primarily from million in decreased employee compensation and related personnel expenses  million in engineering design tools expense which includes a million charge for licensed software tools  which were written off as these tools are not expected to have future alternative uses  million in engineering evaluation board and pre production testing expenses  million in consulting expense  million in facilities and million in travel expense 
the decreased expenses in employee compensation and related personnel expenses was primarily attributable to significantly lower headcount in the united states due to both the reduction in force implemented in the fourth quarter of and to additional decreases in headcount in however  we expect research and development expenses in to be slightly higher than in as we anticipate a higher level of program development 
however  there can be no assurance that our research and development expenses will not increase further in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in increased by to million from million in the million increase resulted primarily from the million charge for surplus space in our fremont  california location which we abandoned and to a million increase in sales commissions  partially offset by decreases in expenses of million in marketing  million in public company compliance  million in travel  million in depreciation and amortization  million in business insurance and million in legal expenses 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses in will decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
however  there can be no assurance that our sales and marketing expense will not increase in the future or that we will develop a cost structure  which will lead to profitability under current and expected revenue levels 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense was  in compared to  in in april  our board of directors determined to supplement the equity based compensation of the board by making an annual grant to each non employee director of  shares of restricted common stock of the company  with such shares vesting on the first anniversary of the date of the grant resulting in a compensation expense of  for the year ended december  the expense was attributable to the amortization of deferred compensation expense recorded in  net of forfeitures  using the graded vesting method  which resulted in accelerated amortization of deferred compensation expense in the earlier years of the awards vesting period 
as required by apb  we have recorded an adjustment to stock based compensation expense related to employees who forfeited options for which compensation expense had been recognized using the graded vesting method  but which are unvested on the date their employment terminated 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net was million in compared to million in the overall rise in interest rates throughout resulted in an increased interest income that more than offset the decrease in funds available for investment 
provision for income taxes the provision for income tax expense was  in and  in the provision for income taxes relates to current taxes payable for income generated by the company s subsidiaries located in foreign jurisdictions 
as of december   we have million and million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state purposes  respectively 
we also have research and development tax credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively

revenues from our dsl products accounted for million  or  of net revenues in  as compared to million  or  of net revenues in the decline in dsl revenues was primarily due to a significant decrease in the number of new dsl subscribers in japan as compared to  and to a much lesser extent  by a decrease in the average selling price 
revenues from japan comprised and of our net revenues in and  respectively 
revenues from voip products accounted for million of revenues in as compared to million in  or and of net revenues  respectively 
the following customers  the both of whom are located in japan  accounted for more than of net revenues years ended december  nec sumitomo gross profit gross profit decreased by million to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to substantially lower unit volume 
the gross profit margin increased to in from in primarily due to lower manufacturing costs which more than offset the decline in the average selling price 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by to million in from million in the million increase resulted primarily from the increase in expenditures for new engineering development programs including million in employee compensation  million in consulting expense  million in software development tools expense  million of engineering evaluation boards expense  and million in travel expense  partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation of million 
in the fourth quarter of we re focused our engineering efforts by implementing a reduction in force resulting in a million charge 
in addition  we recorded a million charge due to the early termination of a certain licensed software development tool 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in increased by to million from million in the increase was largely due to a million increase in compensation and travel expenses resulting from the substantial increase in our sales and marketing headcount  a million increase in costs associated with complying with new corporate governance and public disclosure standards  partially offset by a million decrease in stock based compensation and a million decrease in business insurance 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense was  in compared to million in the million decrease was primarily related to the use of the graded vesting method  which resulted in accelerated amortization of deferred compensation expense in the earlier years of the awards vesting period 
as required by apb  we have recorded an adjustment to stock based compensation expense related to employees who forfeited options for which compensation expense had been recognized using the graded vesting method  but which are unvested on the date their employment terminated 
as of december   deferred compensation had been fully amortized 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net was million in both and as the impact of higher interest rates in offset the decrease in funds available for investment 
provision for income taxes the provision for income tax expense was  in and  in the provisions for income taxes relate to current taxes payable for income generated by centillium s subsidiaries located in foreign jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through operating activities and the sale of equity securities 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million at december  operating activities during used million in cash primarily due to our net loss of million and increases in accounts receivable of million and other current and long term assets of million 
net cash used in operating activities were partially offset by non cash expenses of million for depreciation and amortization  and a million loss on retirement of property and equipment  decrease in inventories of million  and increases of million in accrued liabilities  million in other long term liabilities  million in accrued compensation and related expenses and million in accounts payable 
the loss was due to an organizational infrastructure that was larger than the scale of our business 
inventories decreased at december  primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from later shipments in the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  we anticipate that our operating expenses will be lower in net cash provided by investing activities was million in net cash provided by investing activities related to sales and maturities of short term investments of million  partially offset by purchases of short term investments of million and the purchase of million of property and equipment 
property and equipment purchases relate principally to the purchase of engineering design tools  lab equipment and computer hardware to support our research and development 
we expect expenditures for property and equipment to continue at a similar level in the near term to support our current operating and research and development activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  which consisted of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 
our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
the rate at which we will consume cash will be dependent on the cash needs of future operations that will  in turn  be directly affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the levels of demand for our products and other risks listed in the risk factors section 
contractual obligations significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments are shown in the table below in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating leases     purchase obligations  total  we have taken substantial steps during the second half of and during to reduce losses and preserve cash and anticipate operating expenses in to be less than our future capital requirements depend on many factors that affect our research and development  and sales and marketing activities 
we believe that existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for these cash flow and operating results expectations are subject to numerous assumptions  many of which may not actually occur 
if some or all of such assumptions do not occur  our results may be substantially lower or different than expected 
such assumptions include  without limitation  assumptions that new product introductions will occur on a timely basis and achieve market acceptance  that our existing and potential customer base will continue to grow and that our industry s competitive landscape will not change adversely 
for more information about the risks relating to our business  please read carefully the risk factors set forth below 
we expect to devote capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to support our sales and marketing  and to fund general corporate activities 
from time to time  we receive various inquiries or claims in connection with intellectual property and other rights and may become party to associated claims 
in certain cases  management has accrued estimates of the amounts it expects to pay upon resolution of such matters 
depending on the amount and timing of the resolutions of these claims  our future cash flows could be materially adversely affected in a particular period 
if our existing resources and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements in the long term  we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
the sale of equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas  which requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of every voluntary change in accounting principal unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors beginning in fiscal centillium does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on centillium s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r share based payment which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r was originally effective for reporting periods beginning after june  on april  the us securities and exchange commission announced a deferral of the effective date of fas r for calendar year companies until the beginning of the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition beginning in the first quarter of as noted earlier  centillium has not yet determined whether the adoption of sfas r will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under sfas  but it believes that the adoption will have a material adverse impact on operating results 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for information related to the pro forma effect on centillium s reported net income and net earnings per share of applying the fair value provisions of the sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based employee compensation 
in march  the sec released sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab provides the sec staff position regarding the application of sfas r share based payment 
sab contains interpretive guidance relating to the interaction between sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations  as well as the sec staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
sab also highlights the importance of disclosures made related to the accounting for share based payment transactions 
centillium is currently evaluating sab and will be incorporating it as part of its adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
the guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of assets exchanged 
the guidance in that opinion  however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
this statement amends opinion to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued statement no 
inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  sfas  which amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage 
this statement now requires that these costs be expensed as current period charges 
in addition  this statement requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that our adoption of sfas on january  will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in various areas  including revenue recognition and stock option accounting  accounting standards and practices continue to evolve 
additionally  the sec and the fasb s emerging issues task force continue to address revenue and stock option related accounting issues 
the management of centillium believes it is in compliance with all of the rules and related guidance as they currently exist 
however  any changes to us generally accepted accounting principles in these areas could impact centillium s future accounting 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while concurrently maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the current value of the principal amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities  with maturities of less than eighteen months 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market funds  high quality commercial paper  and government and non government debt securities 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities as of december  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements
