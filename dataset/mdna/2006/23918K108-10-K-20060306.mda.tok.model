the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and item business 
overview we are a leading provider of dialysis services in the united states through a network of approximately  outpatient dialysis centers and hospitals  serving approximately  patients 
in october  we acquired dva renal healthcare  inc formerly known as gambro healthcare  inc  one of the largest dialysis service providers in the united states  for approximately billion  subject to a tax basis step up adjustment  and entered into a year alliance and product supply agreement with gambro valued as a million intangible liability 
at the time of the acquisition  dva renal healthcare was operating outpatient dialysis centers and generating annual revenues of approximately billion 
the operating results of dva renal healthcare are included in our operating results effective october  in accordance with a consent order issued by the federal trade commission on october   we were required to divest a total of outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements in order for us to complete the dva renal healthcare acquisition 
in  we divested a total of centers and terminated the two management services agreements 
in addition  effective january   we completed the sale of three additional centers that were previously pending state regulatory approval 
we received total cash consideration of approximately million for all of the centers divested and used approximately million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture  to distribute a minority owners share of the sale proceeds  and to pay related transaction costs 
we anticipate paying related income taxes of approximately 
table of contents million 
the operating results of the historical davita divested centers and its one management services agreement are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
our stated mission is to be the provider  employer and partner of choice 
we believe our attention to these three areas our patients  our teammates  and our business partners represent the major drivers of our long term success  aside from external factors such as government policy and physician practice patterns 
accordingly  two principal non financial metrics we track are quality clinical outcomes and teammate turnover 
we have developed our own composite index for measuring improvements in our clinical outcomes  which we refer to as the davita quality index  or dqi 
our clinical outcomes have improved over each of the past three years  and we ended with the best clinical outcomes that we have ever achieved 
although it is difficult to reliably measure clinical performance across our industry  we believe our clinical outcomes compare favorably with other dialysis providers in the united states 
over the past several years we have achieved significant reductions in teammate turnover  which has been a major contributor to our performance improvements 
we will continue to focus on these fundamental long term value drivers 
we are pleased with the overall clinical  operating and financial performance levels achieved over the past three years 
although our business has areas of significant potential exposure  as delineated in the risk factors in item a  under the heading risk factors  our operating results over the past three years have not been significantly adversely affected by these risk factors  although we cannot provide any assurance that they will not have an impact in the future 
our operations represent a single reporting segment  with more than of our revenues currently derived directly from providing dialysis services  of which represents outpatient hemodialysis services in  centers that are wholly owned or majority owned 
other direct dialysis services  which are operationally integrated with our center operations  are peritoneal dialysis and home based hemodialysis and hospital inpatient hemodialysis services 
the principal drivers of our revenue are a the number of treatments  which is primarily a function of the number of chronic patients requiring three treatments per week  and b average treatment revenue 
the total patient base is a relatively stable factor  influenced by a demographically growing need for dialysis  our relationships with referring physicians together with the quality of our clinical care  and our pace of opening and acquiring new centers 
the number of dialysis treatments increased approximately in as compared to and approximately in as compared to the acquisition of dva renal healthcare accounted for approximately of treatment volume growth for  and represented approximately of the total treatments in the fourth quarter of approximately of the increase in the number of treatments in resulted from routine acquisitions and approximately was due to increased treatments in existing centers 
acquisitions accounted for approximately of our year over year treatment volume growth  with the remaining attributable to increased treatments in existing centers 
average revenue per treatment is principally driven by our mix of commercial and government principally medicare and medicaid patients  the mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  commercial and government payment rates  and our dialysis services charge capture  billing and collecting operations performance 
on average  payment rates from commercial payors are more than double medicare and medicaid payment rates  and therefore the percentage of commercial patients to total patients represents a major driver of our total average revenue per treatment 
approximately of our patients are currently covered under government programs principally medicare  medicaid  and medicare assigned hmo plans 
the acquisition of dva renal healthcare did not materially affect this patient mix percentage 

table of contents approximately of our total dialysis revenue is from government based programs 
government payment rates are principally determined by federal medicare and state medicaid policy 
these payment rates have limited potential for rate increases and are sometimes at risk of being reduced 
medicare revenues represent approximately of our dialysis revenue 
cumulative net increases in medicare payment rates from through total approximately 
there were no medicare payment rate increases for and a increase was effective on january   however this increase was more than offset by other structural changes to medicare dialysis payment rates that also became effective january  in addition  effective january   cms implemented a increase 
medicaid rates in some states have been under severe budget pressures 
approximately of our dialysis revenue is from commercial insurance and managed care plans 
commercial rates can vary significantly and a major portion of our commercial rates are at contracted amounts with major payors and are subject to intense negotiation pressure 
over the past three years we have been successful in maintaining relatively stable average payment rates in the aggregate for patients with commercial plans  in addition to obtaining periodic fee schedule increases  although we expect continued pressure on commercial payment rates 
approximately of our dialysis revenue has been associated with physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  with epo accounting for approximately of our dialysis revenue 
therefore changes in physician practice patterns  pharmaceutical protocols  and pharmaceutical intensities significantly influence our revenue levels 
such changes  driven by physician practice patterns and protocols focused on improving clinical outcomes  accounted for a significant portion of the increase in average revenue per treatment in our operating performance with respect to dialysis services charge capture  billing and collection can also be a significant factor in how much average revenue per treatment we actually realize 
over the past three years we have invested heavily in new systems and processes that we believe have helped improve our operating performance and reduce our regulatory compliance risks and we expect to continue to improve these systems 
we are in the process of upgrading our billing and collections systems as we integrate our systems with dva renal healthcare s systems which may impact our collections performance 
our revenue recognition involves significant estimation risks 
our estimates are developed based on the best information available to us and our best judgment as to the reasonably assured collectibility of our billings as of the reporting date 
changes in estimates are reflected in the then current period financial statements based upon on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
our annual average dialysis revenue per treatment for continuing operations was  and for   and  respectively 
the revenue per treatment averages for continuing operations for the three and nine month periods ending september   prior to the acquisition of dva renal healthcare  were approximately and per treatment  respectively 
principal factors affecting our average revenue per treatment were increases in our standard fee schedules principally impacting non contracted commercial revenue  changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  commercial contract negotiations  together with a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates 
the combined average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter  including dva renal healthcare s results from october   was per treatment 
the decrease in average revenue per treatment in the fourth quarter reflects the effect of lower average revenue per treatment attributable to the dva renal healthcare centers and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals in the quarter 
our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors  changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  government payment policies  and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future 
additionally  the integration process for the dva renal healthcare billing system could adversely affect our collections through the two to three year transition period 
the principal drivers for our patient care costs are clinical hours per treatment  labor rates  vendor pricing of pharmaceuticals  and business infrastructure and compliance costs 
however  other cost categories can also 
table of contents represent significant cost changes such as increased insurance costs experienced in our average clinical hours per treatment have improved over the past three years primarily because of reduced teammate turnover and improved training and processes 
we believe there is limited opportunity for productivity improvements beyond the levels achieved in and  and federal and state policies can adversely impact our ability to achieve optimal productivity levels 
labor rates have increased consistent with general industry trends 
for the past three years we have been able to negotiate relatively stable pharmaceutical pricing with our vendors 
we expect relatively stable pricing through  however  our agreement with amgen for the purchase of epo includes volume discount and other thresholds which could negatively impact our earnings if we are unable to meet those thresholds 
our acquisition of dva renal healthcare did not have a significant impact on our overall patient costs on a per treatment basis in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses have remained relatively constant as a percent of total revenues over the past three years 
however  this reflects substantial increases in spending related to strengthening our business and regulatory compliance processes  legal and other professional fees  and expanding support functions 
we expect that these higher levels of general and administrative expenses will be generally maintained or increased to support our long term initiatives and to support our efforts to achieve the highest levels of regulatory compliance 
approximately million in integration costs associated with the acquisition of dva renal healthcare were incurred in the fourth quarter of  and we currently expect integration costs to be in the range of million in  exclusive of capital asset expenditures 
although other revenues represent less than of total revenues  successful resolutions of disputed medicare billings at our florida lab resulted in recoveries related to prior years services being recognized as current period revenue and operating income of approximately million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
outlook for we are currently targeting operating income in to be in the million range before the impact of fasb no 
r related to stock based compensation expense 
we currently expect that our pre tax stock option expense will be in the range of million to million  significantly dependent on the timing and amounts of grants in  as well as the company s stock price at those future dates 
these projections and the underlying assumptions involve significant risks and uncertainties  and actual results may vary significantly from these current projections 
these risks  among others  include those relating to the concentration of profits generated from ppo and private indemnity patients  possible reductions in private and government payment rates  changes in pharmaceutical practice patterns  payment policies or pharmaceutical pricing  our ability to maintain contracts with our physician medical directors  legal compliance risks  including our continued compliance with complex government regulations and the ongoing review by the us attorney s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania and the oig  the subpoena from the us attorney s office for the eastern district of new york and the subpoenas from the us attorney s office for the eastern district of missouri  dva renal healthcare s compliance with its corporate integrity agreement  and our ability to complete and integrate acquisitions of businesses  including the integration of dva renal healthcare 
you should read risk factors in this annual report on form k and the forward looking statements and associated risks as discussed on page for more information about these and other potential risks 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise these projections  whether as a result of changes in underlying factors  new information  future events or otherwise 

table of contents results of operations following is a summary of operating results for reference in the discussion that follows 
prior year operating results have been restated to reflect only continuing operations 
year ended december  continuing operations dollar amounts rounded to nearest million  except per treatment data net operating revenues current period services prior years services laboratory operating expenses and charges patient care costs general and administrative depreciation and amortization provision for uncollectible accounts minority interests and equity income  net total operating expenses and charges operating income including prior years recoveries ie  including amounts in italics dialysis treatments average dialysis treatments per treatment day average dialysis revenue per treatment the operating results of dva renal healthcare are included in our operating results from october  our operating income margins  excluding recoveries for prior years lab services  declined from in to in  primarily due to higher labor and benefit costs  and the effects of the dva renal healthcare acquisition 
the average revenue per treatment rates attributable to dva renal healthcare centers are lower than our average rates before the acquisition  and we incurred approximately million in integration costs in the fourth quarter of our combined operating margin for the fourth quarter of was approximately 
net operating revenues operating revenues for current period services increased in compared to and in compared to the acquisition of dva renal healthcare in the fourth quarter of accounted for approximately of the increase in  approximately was due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments with the balance of approximately due to additional increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment and additional lab  management fees and ancillary revenue 
approximately of the increase in was due to increases in the number of dialysis treatments with the balance attributable to increases in the average dialysis revenue per treatment 
dialysis revenues represented approximately  and of net operating revenues in   and  respectively 
lab and other ancillary services and management fee income accounted for the balance of revenues 
dialysis revenues 
we generate approximately  and of our total dialysis revenue from outpatient hemodialysis  peritoneal dialysis and home based dialysis  and hospital inpatient hemodialysis  respectively 
major components of dialysis revenues include the administration of epo and other pharmaceuticals as part of the dialysis treatment  which represents approximately of total dialysis revenues 
approximately of our total dialysis revenues are from government based programs  principally medicare  medicaid  and medicare advantage plans  representing approximately of our total patients 
our 
table of contents non government payors consist principally of commercial insurance plans  including more than with whom we have contracted rates 
additionally  we have approximately  single patient agreements establishing our payment rates for patients not covered by other contracts 
approximately percent of our revenue is associated with non contracted commercial plans 
less than one percent of our dialysis services payments were received directly from patients 
no single commercial payor accounts for more than of total dialysis revenues 
on average we are paid at more than double the medicare or medicaid rates for services provided to patients covered by commercial healthcare plans 
patients covered by employer group health plans transition to medicare coverage after a maximum of months 
as of year end  the medicare esrd dialysis treatment rates for our patients were between and per treatment  or an overall average of per treatment  excluding the administration of separately billed pharmaceuticals 
the majority of our net earnings from dialysis services are derived from commercial payors  some of which pay at negotiated payment rates and others which pay based on our usual and customary fee schedule 
the commercial payment rates are under continuous downward pressure as we negotiate contract rates with large hmos and insurance carriers  and may be further negatively impacted by the dva renal healthcare acquisition 
additionally  as a patient transitions from commercial coverage to medicare or medicaid coverage  the payment rates normally decline substantially 
our year over year treatment volume growth was as follows treatment growth related to existing and newly opened centers routine center acquisitions dva renal healthcare acquisition effective total treatment growth the average dialysis revenue per treatment for continuing operations was  and for   and  respectively 
the revenue per treatment averages for continuing operations for the three and nine month periods ending september   prior to the acquisition of dva renal healthcare  were approximately and per treatment  respectively 
principal factors affecting our average revenue per treatment were increases in our standard fee schedules impacting non contracted commercial revenue  changes in mix and intensity of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  commercial contract negotiations  together with a relatively stable mix of commercial patients and commercial rates 
the combined average revenue per treatment for the fourth quarter  including dva renal healthcare s results effective october  was per treatment 
the decrease in average revenue per treatment in the fourth quarter reflects a lower average revenue per treatment attributable to the dva renal healthcare centers and a decline in the intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals in the quarter 
dva renal healthcare s percentage mix of government and non government patients is similar to our historical percentages 
our ability to negotiate acceptable payment rates with contracted commercial payors  changes in the mix and intensities of physician prescribed pharmaceuticals  government payment policies  and changes in the mix of government and non government payments may materially impact our average revenue per treatment in the future 
additionally  the integration process for the dva renal healthcare billing system could adversely affect our collections through the two to three year transition period 
lab and other services 
lab and other services represented approximately of net operating revenues for and a third party carrier review of medicare claims associated with our florida based laboratory was initiated in no medicare payments were received for our lab services from the second quarter of until the third quarter of while we were appealing the medicare payment withholds 
following a favorable administrative law judge ruling in june  payments for the earliest review periods  as well as for current lab services  were received in the third quarter of favorable rulings were subsequently received for the other review periods  resulting in additional recoveries 
prior year recoveries include approximately million received in  million in  million in  and million in as of december   there are no significant unresolved medicare lab billing issues 

table of contents management fee income 
management fee income represented less than of net operating revenues for and we operated or provided administrative services to and third party or minority owned dialysis centers as of december  and  respectively 
our management fees are principally based on a percentage of the revenue of the managed operations  or based upon a percentage of operating income 
operating expenses and charges patient care costs 
patient care costs are those costs directly associated with operating and supporting our dialysis centers and ancillary operations  and consist principally of labor  pharmaceuticals  medical supplies and facility costs 
as a percentage of current period operating revenues  patient care costs were approximately for  for and for on a per treatment basis  patient care costs increased year over year approximately and in and  respectively 
the increase in was principally due to higher labor and benefit costs  and to a lesser extent medical supply costs 
the overall average patient care costs per treatment in the fourth quarter of were or approximately higher than the full year average 
this increase in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by higher pharmaceutical and other medical supply costs  and reflects the blended average of the combined operations after the acquisition of dva renal healthcare 
the increase in was primarily due to higher labor costs and increases in the levels of revenue generating physician prescribed pharmaceuticals 
the higher labor costs reflect rising labor rates and the effect of the increase in the number of newly opened centers  which are not yet at normal productivity levels 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of those costs not specifically attributable to the dialysis centers and ancillary operations  and include expenses for corporate and divisional administration  including centralized accounting  billing and cash collection functions  and regulatory compliance oversight 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of current period operating revenues were   and in   and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expense for was primarily due to infrastructure costs for expanding business operations  professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives and government investigations  higher labor costs  and integration costs associated with the dva renal healthcare acquisition 
the increase in principally consisted of higher labor costs  professional fees for legal and compliance initiatives  and increases in support infrastructure for corporate initiatives and business expansion 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization was approximately of current period operating revenues for each of the past three years  and for the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding valuations of intangibles acquired or assumed in connection with the acquisition of dva renal healthcare 
provision for uncollectible accounts 
as a result of the dva renal healthcare acquisition and the higher historical provision rate for dva renal healthcare  the post acquisition average provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was in the fourth quarter of the provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were approximately of current period operating revenues for the full year  and for and minority interests and equity income  net 
minority interests net of equity income increased in by approximately million over due to an increase in new centers having minority partners as well as growth in the earnings of our joint ventures 
impairments and valuation adjustments 
we perform impairment or valuation reviews for our property and equipment  amortizable intangibles  and investments in and advances to third party dialysis businesses at least annually and whenever a change in condition indicates that a review is warranted 
such changes include shifts in our business strategy or plans  the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners  or when a center experiences deteriorating operating performance 
goodwill is also assessed at least annually for possible valuation impairment using fair value methodologies 
no significant impairments or valuation adjustments were recognized during the periods presented 

table of contents other income other income  which was a net of approximately million  million  and million for   and  respectively  consisted principally of interest income 
debt expense and refinancing charges debt expense for   and consisted of interest expense of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  and amortization of deferred financing costs of approximately million in  million in  and million in the increase in interest expense in as compared to was primarily attributable to borrowings under our new credit facility in connection with the acquisition of dva renal healthcare  increases in the libor based variable interest rates and issuance of our new senior and senior subordinated notes that have average fixed interest rates of approximately  offset by changes in our libor based receipts from swap settlements 
the decrease in interest expense in as compared to was due to changes in the mix of our debt instruments 
for most of we incurred higher interest rates on our senior subordinated notes  which were paid off in the second half of and replaced with lower interest rate borrowings from our prior credit facility 
this decrease was partially offset by the effect on interest rates from our swap agreements and higher average debt balances 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for represented an effective annualized tax rate of  compared with  and in and the lower effective tax rates for and were primarily due to lower state income taxes and tax valuation allowance adjustments 
we currently project that the effective income tax rate for will be in the range of to 
the higher projected rate for is principally due to favorable tax valuation adjustments in  higher effective state income tax rates  and lower levels of tax exempt interest income 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable balances at december  and represented approximately and days of revenue  respectively  net of bad debt provision 
the relative increase in the days of net revenue in accounts receivable as of december  reflects an increased level of delayed billings and delayed cash collections associated with the medicare certification process for newly opened and acquired centers  as well as general collection patterns 
as of december  approximately million in unreserved accounts receivable  which represented less than of our total unreserved accounts receivable balance  were more than six months old 
there were no significant unreserved balances over one year old 
less than one half of of our treatments are classified as patient pay 
virtually all revenue realized is from government and non government third party payors  as discussed above 
amounts pending approval from third party payors as of december   other than the standard monthly processing  consisted of approximately million associated with medicare bad debt claims  classified as other accounts receivable 
our medicare bad debt claims are typically not paid to us until the medicare fiscal intermediary audits the claims  and such audits typically occur one to four years after the claims are filed 
as a kidney dialysis provider  our revenue is not subject to cost report settlements except for potentially limiting the collectibility of medicare bad debt claims 
dva renal healthcare acquisition on october   we completed our acquisition of dva renal healthcare  inc formerly known as gambro healthcare  inc 
from gambro  inc 
under a stock purchase agreement dated december   for billion  subject to a tax basis step up election 
dva renal healthcare was one of the largest dialysis service providers in the united states  operating outpatient dialysis centers serving approximately  
table of contents patients and generating annual revenues of approximately billion 
we have incurred approximately million in acquisition related costs through december  if we make an election pursuant to section h of the internal revenue code as permitted under the stock purchase agreement  we would be required to make an additional cash payment to gambro inc  which we currently estimate to be approximately million 
this election would result in tax benefits realizable over years 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we entered into an alliance and product supply agreement the supply agreement with gambro ab and gambro renal products  inc for a minimum of years 
the supply agreement has an initial term of seven years and will automatically renew for three additional one year periods if we have not negotiated the terms of an extension during the initial term period 
under the supply agreement we are committed to purchase a significant majority of our hemodialysis products  supplies and equipment at fixed prices 
for the year ended december  our total expenditures on such items was approximately of our total operating costs 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
divestitures per federal trade commission consent order 
as a condition of completing the dva renal healthcare acquisition  we were required by the federal trade commission to divest a total of outpatient dialysis centers and to terminate two management services agreements 
on october   davita and dva renal healthcare completed the sale of outpatient renal dialysis centers to renal advantage inc  formerly known as renalamerica  inc and also completed the sale of one other center to a separate physician group  and terminated the two management services agreements 
in addition  effective january   we completed the sale of three additional centers to renal advantage inc that were previously pending state regulatory approval in illinois 
we received total cash consideration of approximately million for all of the centers divested and used approximately million to purchase the minority interest ownership of a joint venture  to distribute a minority owner s share of the sale proceeds  and to pay related transaction costs 
we anticipate paying related income taxes of approximately million on these divestitures 
as part of this transaction  renal advantage assumed specific liabilities related to the centers and all other liabilities were retained by the company 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the operating results of the historical davita divested centers are accounted for as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
liquidity and capital resources available liquidity 
as of december  our cash balance was million and we had undrawn credit facilities totaling million  of which approximately million was committed for outstanding letters of credit 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and operating cash flows to fund our scheduled debt service and other obligations over the next twelve months 
cash flow from operations during amounted to million  compared with million  including after tax medicare lab recoveries of million for non operating cash outflows in included million for capital asset expenditures  including million for new center developments and  million for acquisitions 
we also received in approximately million from the sale of discontinued operations 
non operating cash outflows in included million for capital asset expenditures  including million for new center developments  million for acquisitions and million for stock repurchases 
the acquisition of dva renal healthcare in the fourth quarter of resulted in the net addition of dialysis centers after related divestitures 
we acquired other dialysis centers and opened new dialysis centers during during  we acquired a total of dialysis centers and opened new dialysis centers 
the largest acquisition during was the purchase of the common stock of physicians dialysis  inc pdi  for approximately million  which added centers 
we currently expect to spend approximately million to million for general capital asset expenditures in  and approximately million to million for new center development and center acquisitions 
our current projections include opening approximately new centers in we expect to 
table of contents generate approximately million to million of operating cash flow in  before capital expenditures and acquisitions 
capital structure changes 
on october   we entered into a new credit agreement allowing for borrowings of up to billion 
the facilities under the credit agreement consist of a million six year revolving credit facility  a million six year term loan a facility and a  million seven year term loan b facility the facilities 
existing borrowings under the facilities bear interest at libor plus margins initially ranging from to 
the margins are subject to adjustment depending upon our achievement of certain financial ratios and can range from to for the revolving credit facility and the term loan a  and to for the term loan b 
the facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors assets 
the credit agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and requires compliance with financial covenants  including a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio that determine the interest rate margins described above 
the aggregate amount of the facilities may be increased by up to million as long as no default exists or would result from such increase and we remain in compliance with the financial covenants after such increase 
such additional loans would be on substantially the same terms as the original borrowings under the facilities 
the term loan a requires annual principal payments of million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and in  maturing in october the term loan b requires annual principal payments of million in years through  million in and  million in  maturing in october on october   we borrowed  million under the facilities million on the revolving credit facility  million on the term loan a and  million on term loan b  and used these borrowings  along with available cash of million  to purchase dva renal healthcare and pay related bank fees and expenses of approximately million and to pay fees and expenses in connection with terminating our then existing credit facility 
on october   we repaid the million of the revolving credit facility with proceeds from the sale of the divested centers 
on march   we issued million of senior notes due and million of senior subordinated notes due and incurred related deferred financing costs of million

substantially all of our facilities are leased 
we have potential acquisition obligations for several jointly owned centers  in the form of put provisions in joint venture agreements  which are exercisable at the third party owners future discretion 
these put provisions  if exercised  would require us to purchase the third party owners interests at either the appraised fair market value or a predetermined multiple of earnings or cash flow attributable to the equity interest put to us

our total expenditures on such items has been approximately of our total operating costs 
the actual amount of purchases in future years under the alliance and product supply agreement will depend upon a number of factors  including the operating and capital requirements of our centers  the number of centers we acquire  growth of our existing centers and gambro renal products ability to meet our needs

in june  dva renal healthcare was served with a complaint filed in the superior court of california by one of its former employees that worked for its california acute services program 
the complaint  which is styled as a class action  alleges  among other things  that dva renal healthcare failed to provide overtime wages  defined rest periods and meal periods  or compensation in lieu of such provisions and failed to comply with certain other california labor code requirements 
we are evaluating the claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter 
we also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action 
at this time  we cannot estimate the range of damages  if any 
on august   blue cross blue shield of louisiana filed a complaint in the united states district court for the western district of louisiana against gambro ab  dva renal healthcare and related entities 
the plaintiff seeks to bring its claims as a class action on behalf of itself and all entities that paid any of the defendants for health care goods and services from on or about january through at least december the complaint alleges  among other things  damages resulting from facts and circumstances underlying dva renal healthcare s december settlement agreement with the department of justice and certain agencies of the united states government 
we are investigating these claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter 
we also intend to vigorously oppose the certification of this matter as a class action 
at this time  we cannot estimate the range of damages  if any 
in addition to the foregoing  we are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business  including from time to time  contractual disputes and professional and general liability claims 
we may also be subject to additional claims by commercial payors and other third parties relating to billing practices and other matters covered by the dva renal healthcare settlement agreement with the department of justice 
we believe that the ultimate resolution of any such pending proceedings  whether the underlying claims are covered by insurance or not  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets  liabilities  and contingencies 
all significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are developed based on the best information 
table of contents available to us at the time made and are regularly reviewed and updated when necessary 
actual results will generally differ from these estimates 
changes in estimates are reflected in our financial statements in the period of change based upon on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
interim changes in estimates are applied prospectively within annual periods 
certain accounting estimates  including those concerning revenue recognition and provision for uncollectible accounts  impairments of long lived assets  variable compensation accruals  accounting for income taxes and purchase accounting valuation estimates  are considered to be critical to evaluating and understanding our financial results because they involve inherently uncertain matters and their application requires the most difficult and complex judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
there are significant estimating risks associated with the amount of revenue that we recognize for a reporting period 
payment rates are often subject to significant uncertainties related to wide variations in the coverage terms of the more than commercial healthcare plans under which we receive payments 
in addition  ongoing insurance coverage changes  geographic coverage differences  differing interpretations of contract coverage  and other payor issues complicate the billing and collection process 
revenue recognition uncertainties inherent in our operations are addressed in aicpa statement of position sop no 
as addressed in sop no 
 net revenue recognition and allowances for uncollectible billings require the use of estimates of the amounts that will actually be realized considering  among other items  retroactive adjustments that may be associated with regulatory reviews  audits  billing reviews and other matters 
revenues associated with medicare and medicaid programs are recognized based on a the payment rates that are established by statute or regulation for the portion of the payment rates paid by the government payor eg for medicare patients and b for the portion not paid by the primary government payor  the estimated amounts that will ultimately be collectible from other government programs paying secondary coverage eg medicaid secondary coverage  the patient s commercial health plan secondary coverage  or the patient 
commercial healthcare plans  including contracted managed care payors  are billed at our usual and customary rates  however  revenue is recognized based on estimated net realizable revenue for the services provided 
net realizable revenue is estimated based on contractual terms for the patients under healthcare plans with which we have formal agreements  non contracted healthcare plan coverage terms if known  estimated secondary collections  historical collection experience  historical trends of refunds and payor payment adjustments retractions  inefficiencies in our billing and collection processes that can result in denied claims for payments  and regulatory compliance issues 
determining applicable primary and secondary coverage for our more than  patients at any point in time  together with the changes in patient coverages that occur each month  requires complex  resource intensive processes 
collections  refunds and payor retractions typically continue to occur for up to three years and longer after services are provided 
our range of dialysis revenue estimating risk is generally expected to be within of total revenue  which can represent as much as of operating income 
changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements based on on going actual experience trends  or subsequent settlements and realizations depending on the nature and predictability of the estimates and contingencies 
changes in revenue estimates for prior periods are separately disclosed and reported if material to the current reporting period and longer term trend analyses 
lab service revenues for current period dates of services are recognized at the estimated net realizable amounts to be received 
impairments of long lived assets 
we account for impairment of long lived assets  which include property and equipment  investments  amortizable intangible assets and goodwill  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets or sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  as applicable 
impairment reviews are performed whenever a change in condition occurs which indicates that the carrying amounts of assets may not be recoverable  and at least annually for goodwill 

table of contents such changes include changes in our business strategies and plans  changes in the quality or structure of our relationships with our partners and deteriorating operating performance of individual dialysis centers 
we use a variety of factors to assess the realizable value of assets depending on their nature and use 
such assessments are primarily based upon the sum of expected future undiscounted net cash flows over the expected period the asset will be utilized  as well as market values and conditions 
the computation of expected future undiscounted net cash flows can be complex and involves a number of subjective assumptions 
any changes in these factors or assumptions could impact the assessed value of an asset and result in an impairment charge equal to the amount by which its carrying value exceeds its actual or estimated fair value 
accounting for income taxes 
we estimate our income tax provision to recognize our tax expense for the current year and our deferred tax liabilities and assets for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply in the periods when the deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be realized 
deferred tax assets are assessed based upon the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income and  to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
the allowance is regularly reviewed and updated for changes in circumstances that would cause a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these calculations and assessments involve complex estimates and judgments because the ultimate tax outcome can be uncertain or future events unpredictable 
variable compensation accruals 
we estimate variable compensation accruals quarterly based upon the annual amounts expected to be earned and paid out resulting from the achievement of certain teammate specific and or corporate financial and operating goals 
our estimates  which include compensation incentives for bonuses  awards and benefit plan contributions  are updated periodically based on changes in our economic condition or cash flows that could ultimately impact the actual final award 
actual results may vary due to the subjectivity involved in anticipating fulfillment of specific and or corporate goals  as well as the final determination and approval of amounts by our board of directors 
purchase accounting valuation estimates 
the valuation of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired or assumed in connection with the dva renal healthcare acquisition required numerous assessments and assumptions  including those concerning dialysis industry trends  our company s business strategies and plans  the strategies of present or potential competitors  the quality of our continuing relationships with physicians and teammates and the likely effects of changes in those relationships  and other competitive and market conditions including those that involve dialysis product suppliers 
these assumptions include expected outcomes under different acquisition agreement terms  and as a result  involve estimates of which the ultimate accuracy will never be known 
these assumptions can have a material effect on our balance sheet valuations and the related amount of depreciation and amortization expense that will be recognized in the future 
long lived tangible and intangible assets will be subject to our regular ongoing impairment assessments 
significant new accounting standards effective january  we adopted sfas statement no 
r  share based payment  that amended fasb statements no 
and and supersedes apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  such as stock options  based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize such cost over the requisite period during which an employee provides service 
the grant date fair value will be determined using option pricing models adjusted for unique characteristics of the equity instruments 
the standard also addresses the accounting for transactions that involve the creation of a liability in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of its equity instruments or that may be settled through the issuance of such equity instruments 
the standard does not change the accounting for transactions of equity instruments issued for services to non employees or the accounting for employee stock ownership plans 
the standard also requires that the tax benefits realized from stock option exercises in excess of the stock based compensation expenses recognizable for financial statement purposes be reported as a cash flows from financing activities rather than as an operating cash flow as currently required 
this would reduce net operating cash flows 
table of contents and increase net financing cash flows upon adoption 
we currently expect that our pretax stock option expense will be in the range of million to million  significantly dependent on the timing and amounts of grants in  as well as the company s stock price at those future dates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the tables below provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for our debt obligations the table presents principal repayments and current weighted average interest rates on our debt obligations as of december  the variable rates presented reflect the current rates in effect at the end of including the economic effects of our swap agreements 
these rates are based on libor plus margins based upon performance and leverage criteria plus the economic impact from the swap agreements

as of december   the total fair value of these swaps was an asset of approximately million 
also during  we recorded million  net of tax  of additional comprehensive income for the changes in fair value of the effective portions of these swaps 
in conjunction with the repayment and extinguishment of our prior credit facilities during  we reclassified into net income million of swap valuation gains that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income 
these gains represented the accumulated fair value of several interest rate swap instruments that became ineffective as cash flow hedges as a result of the repayment of our prior credit facilities 
in addition we recorded a net loss of million related to changes in fair values of these swaps that were not effective as interest rate hedges until they were redesignated in the second quarter of portions of our various interest rate swap agreements that were previously designated and expected to be effective as forward cash flow hedges became ineffective as a result of us not having any variable rate libor based interest payments during a portion of this resulted in a net charge of million to swap valuation gains  which includes the million discussed above as well as a reclassification into income of million of swap valuation losses that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income

under this model  with all else constant  it is estimated that such an increase would have reduced net income by approximately million  million  and million  net of tax  for the years ended december    and  respectively
