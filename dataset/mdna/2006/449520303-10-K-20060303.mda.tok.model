critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  the company is required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that the company believes are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the critical accounting policies that the company believes are the most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating its reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title 
the company offers the right of return for defective products and continuously monitors and tracks product returns 
the company records a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based on historical experience and any notification received of pending returns 
although such returns have historically been insignificant  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same return rates as it has in the past 
any significant increase in product returns could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which the returns materialize 
the company does not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment and passage of title has occurred  the price to our customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes rental revenues from medical pumps over the term of the related agreement  generally on a month to month basis 
pump rentals are billed at the company s established rates  which often significantly differ from contractually allowable rates provided by third party payors such as medicare  medicaid and commercial insurance carriers 
the company records net rental revenues at the estimated realizable amounts from patients and third party payors 
the company experiences significant delays in payment with certain of these third party payors  but it continuously monitors reimbursement rates of the third party payors and the timing of such payments 
any change in reimbursement or collection rates could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period or periods in which the change is identified 

table of contents accounts receivable the company performs various analyses to evaluate accounts receivable balances 
it records an allowance for bad debts based on the estimated collectibility of the accounts such that the recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value 
the company applies specified percentages to the accounts receivable agings to estimate the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible and therefore should be reserved 
the percentages are increased as the accounts age 
if the actual uncollected amounts are less than the previously estimated allowance  a favorable adjustment would result 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  the company s operating results would be significantly and adversely affected 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory and the current estimated market value of the inventory 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory on specifically identified items based primarily on the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next two years 
a significant increase in the demand for the company s products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and thus the company may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have over reported cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although the company seeks to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of its inventory and reported operating results 
deferred taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the future tax consequences attributable to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if the company operates at a profit in the future and generates sufficient future taxable income  it could be required to reverse the current valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  which would result in a substantial decrease in the provision for income taxes in the period of reversal 
likewise  if the company is unable to operate at a profit and unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  it could be required to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against all of its deferred tax assets indefinitely 
goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  required the company to cease amortizing goodwill and indefinite life intangibles effective january  the company s business combinations have at various times resulted in the acquisition of goodwill and other intangible assets  which may affect the amount of future period amortization expense and impairment expense that the company may incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect its consolidated financial statements 
the company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that an impairment of goodwill has possibly occurred 
the company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying value  as well as other factors  to determine whether or not any potential impairment of goodwill exists 
if a potential impairment exists  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities 
the company cannot guarantee that there will be no impairment in the future 
if the company is required to recognize an impairment of goodwill  the company s operating results could be significantly and adversely affected
