company and product overview we design  manufacture and market innovative gaming machines and vlts for customers in legalized gaming jurisdictions world wide 
our products consist primarily of multi coin  multi line video gaming machines and we were one of the original developers of such gaming machines in the us market 
our video gaming machines include engaging themes  advanced graphics and digital sound effects and music 
we have also developed and sell mechanical reel spinning gaming machines and poker games  which we began shipping to customers in fiscal as part of our efforts to fully serve the gaming machine needs of our customers 
our games integrate secondary bonus rounds as additions to the primary game to create a game within a game for more exciting and interactive play 
if players achieve various milestones in the primary game  they move on to play a secondary game without additional wagering for additional bonuses 
the player can win in both the primary game and the secondary game 
in our secondary bonus games  the player has various choices to make regarding the bonus features 
for example  in some games the player can select from a variety of tokens or characters to obtain or reveal the bonus 
amusing  entertaining or familiar graphics and musical themes add to the player appeal of our games 
we generate revenue in two principal ways 
first  we generate product sales revenues from the sale to casinos and other licensed gaming machine operators of new and used gaming machines and vlts  conversion kits including theme and or operating system conversions  parts  and original equipment manufacturing oem for third parties 
second  we earn gaming operations revenues from leasing participation gaming machines and vlts  and earn royalties that we receive from third parties under license agreements to use our game content 
our gaming machines are installed in all of the major regulated gaming jurisdictions in the united states  as well as in foreign gaming jurisdictions 
our revenues for the past three years were as follows in millions revenues product sales gaming operations total revenues refer also to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report for further information 

table of contents product sales we offer the following products for sale multi coin  multi line video gaming machines 
our line of multi coin  multi line gaming machines combine advanced graphics  digital sound effects and music  and secondary bonus games 
in the primary game  the video screen of these gaming machines simulates traditional mechanical reel spinning gaming machines 
in the bonus round for our games  the video screen shows a variety of amusing interactive themed content 
depending on the game  the player can wager up to coins per play 
we have a strong player following in this product category since the successful introduction of reel em in in and we now have game themes approved for our video product line and cpu nxt operating system 
we introduced new game themes in this product category during fiscal  compared to new games in fiscal mechanical reel spinning gaming machines 
we now have game themes approved for our mechanical reel product line and operating system 
we have received approvals for five series of three reel mechanical reel games under the can t lose  scroll top  ring  color dotmation and megamultiplier series brand names  plus our four reel mechanical gaming machines 
the five reel mechanical gaming machine is one of the fastest growing products on today s casino floors 
our hot hot super jackpot series of games  which was approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal and was the first bonus bet five reel mechanical gaming machine in the market  offers our first low denomination mechanical reel games and features an additional side bet to increase the frequency of the bonus round 
this new product is also based on our new mechanical reel platform  powered by cpu nxt  and features state of the art lighting and sound package that make the gaming machines stand out on a casino floor 
we launched this product line with three new base games  with additional games to follow 
we introduced new mechanical reel game themes during fiscal  compared to new game themes in fiscal poker 
our poker product line currently includes way action  reel em in poker and world series of poker 
we recently received approval for  and in early march launched the first world series of poker branded gaming machine in conjunction with harrah s  the licensor 
the first game is a multi set of traditional poker products leveraging the world series of poker brand name and one of the games includes a bonus feature where players participate in the final table of the world series of poker event 
these games were exclusively featured at harrah s casinos for most of the june quarter  before we introduced this product line at other casinos 
we commercialized this game as a casino owned daily fee game where the casino purchases the base hardware and leases the top box and game theme for a lower lease price point than if they leased the entire gaming machine 
parts sales  game conversions  oem and used games 
we sell replacement parts and game theme conversions for our legacy and bluebird gaming machines 
we also sell cpu nxt upgrade kits  which enable casinos to upgrade legacy wms gaming machines in order to obtain all the features and functionality of the cpu nxt operating system for a lesser price compared to the purchase of a new bluebird cabinet 
in addition  we manufacture and sell gaming stations in legacy and bluebird cabinets under oem agreements 
we also sell used games that are acquired on a trade in basis or that were previously placed on a participation basis 
we expect that our revenues from these sources will increase in the future as our installed base of gaming machines sold expands 
gaming operations our gaming operations business includes the following participation games 
wms owned gaming machines that we lease based upon any of the following payment methods are referred to as participation games a percentage of the net win of the gaming machines  fixed daily fees  or in the case of wide area progressive gaming machines  a percentage of the amount wagered or a combination of a fixed daily fee and a percentage of the amount wagered 
we have the ability to place these gaming machines on a participation basis because the 
table of contents popularity of the brand and the superior performance of the game generates higher wagering and net win to the casinos or gaming machine operators than the games we sell to casinos or other gaming machine operators 
wap participation games 
a wap system electronically links gaming machines that are located across multiple casinos within a gaming jurisdiction  or across native american gaming jurisdictions 
the linked gaming machines contribute to and compete for large  system wide progressive jackpots and are designed to increase gaming machine play for participating casinos by giving the players the opportunity to win a larger jackpot than on a stand alone gaming machine 
our wap games include titles under the monopoly brand  clint eastwood based games and  since march  the powerball brand 
our powerball gaming machines include both video and mechanical reel gaming machines based on our new mechanical reel platform powered by cpu nxt  and feature nine local area progressive jackpots that add to the excitement of playing the game since the player could win up to nine local jackpots in one spin 
since inception  the powerball games have performed at a premium above the initial performance of our prior wap links 
net win per gaming machine on wap systems is generally higher than on lap and non linked stand alone participation gaming machines 
wap game themes are also used in lap gaming machines or stand alone participation gaming machines in jurisdictions where we do not operate a wap system 
lap participation games 
a lap system electronically links gaming machines that are located within a single casino to a progressive jackpot for that specific casino 
our lap gaming machines feature our proprietary brand  jackpot party progressive and  in those jurisdictions where we do not operate a wap system  powerball 
these games also include a lcd screen in the topbox that provides new and entertaining bonus experiences 
our lap products give the player the chance to win multiple progressive jackpots and leverage both our exclusive brand names and our gameplay intellectual property which tend to drive up the average bet on these games 
net win per gaming machine on lap systems is generally higher than on non linked stand alone participation gaming machines on a casino floor  but lower than that of wap games 
stand alone participation games 
we lease participation games on a non linked basis  which we call stand alone games 
our stand alone games feature  among others  licensed titles under the monopoly  men in black and hollywood squares brands and  in those jurisdictions where we do not operate a wap system  clint eastwood based games 
our stand alone gaming machines generally feature larger mechanical or video top boxes and provide game play experiences not possible on a single screen game 
casino owned daily fee games 
this category consists of gaming machines where the casino purchases the base hardware of the gaming machine and we lease the top box and game theme to the casino at a lower fixed daily lease fee 
this category features titles under the match game  password  supermarket sweep and you bet your life brands  as well as wms branded games 
casino owed daily fee games feature a second lcd screen in the topbox that provides new and entertaining bonus experiences for the player 
video lottery terminals 
our vlts include both video and mechanical reel spinning gaming machines 
they feature advanced graphics  digital sound effects and music and incorporate many of the same features from our other gaming machines 
we offer a variety of multi game and single themed vlts 
our vlts may be operated as stand alone units or may interface with central monitoring computers operated by government agencies 
our vlts typically are located in places where casino type gaming is not the principal attraction  such as racetracks  bars and restaurants 
we began offering vlts with cpu nxt and in the bluebird cabinet in the second quarter of fiscal licensing 
we derive revenue from the licensing of game themes and content 
methods for determining the license or royalty revenue vary  but generally are based on a fixed amount for each licensed game placed or shipped in a period  or a fixed daily royalty amount for each game 
we earn license or royalty revenues primarily from multimedia games inc  stargames corporation pty 
ltd 
and bally technologies inc 
table of contents for casino owned daily fee games  casinos also have the option to either lease the complete gaming machine  top box and game theme in which case the unit is classified as a stand alone participation game  or to purchase outright the base gaming machine  top box and game theme at a premium price which is classified as product sales revenue 
in certain jurisdictions  vlt operators purchase outright our vlts and we classify the revenue from these purchases as product sales revenues 
in other jurisdictions  vlt operators lease our vlts and pay us a lease rate based on the net earnings of the gaming machine 
we classify the lease payments as gaming operations revenues 
we do not include vlts in our installed base of participation games 
server based gaming we believe that server based gaming sbg will be the next significant technology development in the gaming machine industry 
server based gaming refers to a gaming system in which game content and peripherals are configured  maintained and refreshed over a network that links groups of gaming machines to a remote server that also enables custom configuration by operators and central determination of game outcomes 
server based gaming initiatives will require regulatory approval in gaming jurisdictions prior to any implementation and represent a significant addition to our existing portfolio of product offerings 
our vision for sbg emphasizes enhanced game play and excitement for the player  in addition to the above mentioned functions 
in a networked environment  we believe game play will no longer be limited to an individual gaming machine  rather  we believe sbg will permit game play to be communal among multiple players 
our wide area game enhanced network  or wage net product  is currently undergoing regulatory review  and we expect to launch the first phase of our server based game initiative  monopoly big event  in the december quarter 
it will offer a first of its kind true community gaming experience  where all eligible players win in the bonus round together 
this product has a central server to control the shared communal play  and utilizes the enhanced graphics and game play of our cpu nxt operating platform 
we have designed wage net so that it will support our casino customers existing investment in our bluebird products  and yet enable them to begin to move towards server based gaming 
recent developments acquisition of orion gaming on july   we acquired of the outstanding stock of privately held orion financement company bv  a netherlands based holding company that designs  manufactures and sells gaming machines 
we expect the acquisition to expand our international presence and game library  while adding a proven product development team focused on international opportunities 
orion gaming s senior management  which has led the company from inception  will remain with the company 
orion gaming will operate as a separate subsidiary 
the transaction is expected to be neutral to slightly accretive to our fiscal net income 
gulf coast hurricanes during the september quarter  two hurricanes devastated the gulf coast of louisiana and mississippi  which affected our facilities and our customers facilities 
we reopened our gulfport  ms facility in november  but incurred  and continue to incur  hurricane related revenue loss from the following items a the inability to deliver orders for new units  many of them premium priced units  and to install incremental participation games and casino owned daily fee games  b lost revenues per day per machine from participation games  including wap games  and casino owned daily fee games that continued to be inoperable at june   c lost revenues from participation games  including wap games and casino owned daily fee games installed in casinos that were closed immediately after the hurricanes but reopened before june   and d lost new unit  parts sales and conversion revenues 
historically  our participation revenue per day in the mississippi and louisiana markets has been over higher than our overall average 

table of contents russian market we have a distribution agreement with a third party covering russia and certain other countries 
in july  the russian government began enacting certain changes to its gaming laws to enhance the regulatory environment in russia 
during this on going regulatory transition  demand for new gaming machines has abated and  as a result  we only sold new gaming machines to our russian distributor in fiscal  compared to almost  gaming machines in fiscal currently  we expect the russian market to begin to return to more normal demand in the latter part of fiscal  but this timing is dependent on the russian legislature s full implementation of changes in the law 
refer also to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this report for further information 
industry overview there are three classes of gaming markets class i gaming includes traditional native american social and ceremonial games 
class i gaming is regulated exclusively at the native american tribe level 
class ii gaming includes bingo  electronic aids to bingo  and  if played at the same location where bingo is offered  pull tabs and other games similar to bingo 
class ii gaming is regulated by individual native american tribes  with the national indian gaming commission having oversight of the tribal gaming regulatory process 
class iii gaming includes all other forms of gaming that are not included in either class i or class ii  including gaming machines 
we currently serve the class ii through agreements with third parties and class iii markets 
casino operators continuously seek to increase revenue growth and profitability at their casinos 
the importance of gaming machine revenue to casino operators profitability has created demand for gaming machines that have the ability to generate superior net win 
as a result  the pace of innovation in game design continues to accelerate  and gaming equipment manufacturers have increasingly focused on enhancing the overall entertainment value and appeal of games and gaming machines 
we believe that four of the most significant recent developments in gaming machine design have been the development of video gaming machines that simulate mechanical reel spinning gaming machines  the introduction of gaming machines with secondary bonus rounds  cashless gaming and low denomination wagering coupled with local area and wide area progressive jackpots video gaming machines that simulate a mechanical reel spinning gaming machine on a video screen are predominantly multi coin  multi line gaming machines that offer multiple distinct pay lines and allow up to or more coins to be wagered on a single play 
this tends to increase the average wager per play 
secondary bonusing allows a player to advance beyond the primary game into a bonus round if the player attains a specified result in the primary game 
the bonus rounds are designed to create significant player appeal by giving the player more interactive options and a sense of investment in the game 
this encourages the player to continue to play the primary game in an effort to achieve all of the bonus rounds in a game 
in addition  the bonus rounds give game designers an opportunity to incorporate additional entertaining content into the game 
various forms of cashless gaming reduce casino operators costs and machine downtime as coins are no longer dispensed from the gaming machine when a casino patron wants to cash out 
instead  the gaming machine prints tickets or  through casino systems  banks the payout in an account for the casino patron 
this technology has proven popular with casino patrons and casino operators 

table of contents low denomination video and mechanical reel games coupled with local and wide area progressive jackpots allow the casino patron more flexibility in wagering a lower number of coins with multiple chances to win 
lower denomination settings are cent  cents  cents  cents and cents 
most penny gaming machines average lines and up to credits per line coins  or  per play  based on the maximum possible wager 
with secondary bonuses and local or wide area progressive jackpots  players can win large amounts on a single wager 
the growing popularity of the low denomination gaming machines has significantly impacted the evolution of game development technology 
we expect continued demand for multi coin  multi line video gaming machines and other gaming machines that offer the player secondary bonus rounds and other enhanced entertainment features  which we believe result in higher amounts wagered and higher net win per machine for casinos 
as casino operators continue to adopt cashless gaming in their casinos  we expect that most of the gaming machines we sell or place in casinos will support cashless gaming 
as mentioned in the company and product overview above  we believe that server based gaming will be the next significant technology development in the gaming machine industry 
server based gaming initiatives will require regulatory approval in gaming jurisdictions prior to any implementation 
see government regulation below for further information 
vlts include both video and mechanical reel spinning gaming machines 
vlts are sold  leased to  or operated as participation games by government agencies that desire to raise revenue for the jurisdictions in which they operate 
most vlts are linked to a central computer for accounting and security purposes and are monitored by state lotteries or other government authorities 
unlike gaming machines designed for the casino market  most vlts are located in places where casino type gaming is not the principal attraction  such as racetracks  bars and restaurants 
in the last decade  several us states including new york  delaware  oregon and rhode island have enacted legislation permitting vlts 
business strategy our business strategy is to increase our market penetration in major regulated gaming jurisdictions worldwide by developing entertaining products and providing outstanding service 
this strategy includes the following elements leveraging our product development expertise to introduce innovative new games we have almost years of experience developing fun  humorous and exciting games in a variety of industries 
over the past four years  we have enhanced our game development efforts by adding key management  design personnel and software engineers to our product development group 
we have renovated our facilities and organized our game development team into a studio format to help promote innovation while maintaining a focused development approach in an effort to maximize the entertainment value of our products 
we believe that our proven game development capabilities  combined with the additional functionalities and enhanced features of our new gaming platform  will enable us to increase our market share 
maximizing the potential of our participation games and exclusive licenses of popular brands as the exclusive licensee of the monopoly brand for use with gaming machines  we have converted a popular board game brand into a successful line of superior earning gaming machines 
we have also licensed additional brands  including world series of poker  men in black and powerball and now have several series of participation game themes utilizing these brands 
the name recognition and creative game design of our branded products have allowed us to lease them to casino operators as participation games  generating a high margin recurring revenue stream for ourselves  as well as the casinos 
we continue to pursue new licensed brands and additional themes based on the guidance of focus group testing of casino patrons 

table of contents our product offerings engaging and humorous themes and a high degree of player interactivity are incorporated into each of our games  particularly in the secondary bonus rounds 
we believe that by designing games and gaming machines that are fun and interesting to play and incorporating the latest gaming technologies  we supply games and gaming machines with superior player appeal 
we have also expanded our product lines to be able to fully serve casino operators gaming machine requirements 
see company and product overview above for further information 
our technology foundation we have received the requisite regulatory approvals for the upgraded version of our legacy operating system software and for our current operating system and gaming platform  cpu nxt  that supports added functionality  increased graphical capability and speed of play of our video gaming machines 
in fiscal  we migrated our mechanical reel product line onto the cpu nxt operating system 
we continue to work to incorporate new technologies into our software and hardware platforms in anticipation of evolving customer preferences and future regulatory requirements 
our innovative bluebird cabinets our innovative bluebird cabinet is used for our video  mechanical reel spinning  poker  participation and vlt products 
with of the internal components being interchangeable between upright and slant models  the bluebird cabinet is easier and faster to service than our legacy cabinets 
bluebird cabinets incorporate features such as an ergonomic design  inch digital  high resolution flat screen monitors for the video version of the product that can display advanced graphics generated by our cpu nxt operating system  simultaneous coin in coin out and cashless capabilities  and sound systems by bose corporation bose  including the bose free field directed audio system that reduces peripheral distracting noises 
continuing our expansion into international markets we are authorized to conduct business in foreign gaming jurisdictions 
we anticipate growth in foreign markets with the continued penetration of cpu nxt  bluebird  mechanical reel spinning gaming machines  video poker games and additional game titles 
we have offices in the united states  australia  italy  south africa  spain and the united kingdom and have plans to expand into argentina and macau 
the united kingdom office houses an internationally focused game development studio and  beginning in fiscal  includes sales and distribution functions 
we continue to view russia as a market with high growth potential  once the legislature completes enacting changes to the gaming laws 
with our july acquisition of orion gaming  we added a production  development and distribution facility based in the netherlands 
orion s products have a slightly lower price point  which we believe will appeal to certain international customers 
in addition  we are developing a low price point product for russia and certain other markets that we expect to begin offering in fiscal design  research and product development our designers  engineers and artists build upon over years of experience that we  together with our predecessors  have in designing and developing fun  humorous and exciting games 
we are continually developing new games in order to refresh the installed base of our gaming machines and implementing new technologies and functionality to enhance player entertainment 
our gaming machines and games are usually designed and programmed by our internal engineering staff and game design studios 
our game design teams operate in a studio environment that encourages creativity  productivity and cooperation among design teams 
our chicago research and design facility is a state of the art technology campus that houses four development studios  with additional studios in las vegas  london  sydney and  with our july acquisition of orion gaming  the netherlands 
each studio works concurrently on multiple games and is staffed with software developers  graphic artists  mathematicians and game developers 
in some cases  we may outsource testing and graphic design functions to independent designers under contract to us 

table of contents during fiscal  and  we spent approximately million  million and million  respectively  on design  research and product development 
customer specific research and development costs for new products were not significant in any year 
we also have additional property available for future expansion of our chicago facility  beginning in fiscal some of our gaming machines are based on popular brands licensed from third parties  such as hasbro inc  cbs consumer products and sony pictures consumer products inc typically  we are obligated to make minimum royalty payments over the term of our license agreement and to make advanced payments against those commitments 
the licensor typically must inspect and approve any use of the licensed property 
in addition  each license typically provides that the licensor retains the right to exploit the licensed property for all other purposes  including the right to license the property for use with any products not related to gaming machines 
we have entered into a technology transfer agreement with cyberscan technology inc d b a cyberview technology  under which we purchased the latest versions of cyberview s server based and downloadable gaming system and related technologies 
the non exclusive agreement also gives us the right to create derivative versions of these systems and to use  sell  lease  export or distribute the cyberview technologies  subject to certain restrictions including time and product restrictions on entry into certain markets 
cyberview designs and develops server based game download and gaming systems and related player stations and equipment 
the cyberview technologies purchased by us include centrally controlled game download and remote configuration subsystems  as well as a centrally controlled outcome determination module and advanced security and authentication capabilities 
in addition  cyberview has granted us a non exclusive  perpetual  irrevocable  worldwide license to its technology patent portfolio related to server based gaming 
cyberview provided our system technology team with initial technical and functional support to enable us to operate  maintain and further develop these technologies 
we also have entered into a five year agreement through fiscal to license certain of our game content to cyberview for use in lottery markets and certain other non casino markets outside of north america in exchange for ongoing royalties 
in addition  we obtained a right of first refusal relating to the of the common shares of cyberscan technology held by cyberview s principal stockholders 
we have entered into agreements with other third parties to accelerate our development of advanced gaming system solutions that we believe will catalyze the next cycle of technology implementation as server based gaming 
these agreements are in line with our strategy to be at the forefront of content enablement and innovation for the casino floor 
sales and marketing we are authorized to sell or lease our gaming machines to casinos in tribal jurisdictions and other gaming jurisdictions worldwide 
see also government regulation general below 
in most gaming jurisdictions  we sell our gaming machines directly  rather than through the use of distributors  which we believe allows us to provide superior customer service and enhances profitability 
from our introduction of the bluebird cabinet and cpu nxt in september through august   we have issued sales orders or executed agreements to sell over  bluebird gaming machines or cpu nxt upgrade kits 
of the over  units for which we have issued sales orders or executed agreements  over  of them were shipped by august  of the remaining units  approximately  are bluebird units and approximately  are cpu nxt upgrade kits 
we expect to deliver the balance of these units over the next four quarters 

table of contents we sell and lease our gaming machines through salespeople in offices in several united states locations  and salespeople in our international offices four in our office in spain  three in our office in south africa  two in canada  one in the netherlands  one in italy  and one in the united kingdom 
with our july acquisition of orion gaming  we added three salespeople in the netherlands 
we also have plans to place salespeople in argentina and macau 
our salespeople earn a salary and commissions 
our gaming machines are primarily marketed through direct sales  trade shows  promotional videotapes  our proprietary website and advertising in trade journals 
no single customer accounted for or more of our revenues in fiscal  or our field services department is a customer focused organization  responsible for attending to the needs of our customers 
our field service technicians install gaming machines at the customer s request  work with our customers in performing routine maintenance on participation gaming machines owned by us that are located at our customers casinos  initiate sales of replacement parts and game theme conversions  and assist with general maintenance on gaming machines owned by our customers 
we also recently opened a centralized call center that will allow us to be even more responsive to our customers needs 
for international markets  we have translated our most popular domestic game themes into spanish  portuguese  french  russian  italian and mandarin chinese 
no single foreign country accounted for or more of our revenues in fiscal  or substantially all foreign sales are made in united states dollars 
revenue from participation gaming machines has been primarily limited to north america  and we expect this trend to continue 
refer to note  information on geographic areas  of our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information on international sales 
we generally offer customers payment terms of to days from the date of invoice 
in certain circumstances  such as large orders  we may offer extended payment terms of up to two years  in which case we usually charge interest to the customer 
competition the gaming machine market is intensely competitive and is characterized by the continuous introduction of new game titles and new technologies 
our ability to compete successfully in this market is based  in large part  upon our ability to create an expanding and constantly refreshed portfolio of games with high earnings performance  offer gaming machines that consistently out perform gaming machines manufactured by our competitors  identify and develop or obtain rights to commercially marketable intellectual properties  and adapt our products for use with new technologies 
in addition  successful competition in this market is based upon engineering innovation and reliability  mechanical and electronic reliability  brand recognition  marketing and customer support  and competitive prices and lease terms 
we estimate that about companies in the world manufacture gaming machines and vlts for legalized gaming markets 
of these companies  we believe that international game technology igt  bally technologies formerly alliance gaming  aristocrat technologies  novomatic  atronic casino technology  
table of contents lottomatica s recently acquired subsidiary g tech holdings  and wms have a majority of this worldwide market 
in the video and mechanical reel spinning gaming machine market  we compete with market leader igt  as well as aristocrat technologies  bally technologies  atronic casino technology  progressive gaming  konami  franco and unidesa 
in the vlt market  we compete primarily with igt  g tech holdings and scientific games 
our competitors vary in size from small companies with limited resources to a few large corporations with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
the larger competitors  particularly igt  have an advantage in being able to spend greater amounts than us to develop new technologies  games and features that are attractive to players and customers 
in addition  some of our competitors have developed  sell or otherwise provide to customers security  centralized player tracking and accounting systems which allow casino operators to accumulate accounting and performance data about the operation of gaming machines 
we do not currently offer these systems 
several of our competitors pooled their intellectual property patents that provide cashless gaming alternatives  specifically ticket in ticket out technology  so that when a casino patron cashes out from a gaming machine they may receive a printed ticket instead of coins 
we license this technology from these competitors and pass through the license fee to our customers 
this license expires on september   and we are currently in negotiation for an extension of this license 
manufacturing other than our orion gaming products  we manufacture all of our gaming machines at our facility in waukegan  illinois 
in fiscal  we began reconfiguring our assembly lines in order to lower our product lead times and effectively increase our practical capacity 
we began to expand our waukegan facility in fiscal in order to provide for further production efficiencies 
with our july acquisition of orion gaming  we added a manufacturing facility in the netherlands 
manufacturing commitments are generally based on sales orders from customers 
in some cases  however  component parts are purchased and assembled into finished goods that are inventoried in order to be able to quickly fill anticipated customer orders 
our manufacturing process generally consists of assembling component parts to complete a gaming machine 
we generally warranty our gaming machines sold in the us for a period of days  while we generally warranty our gaming machines sold internationally for a period of days to one year 
the raw materials used in manufacturing our gaming machines include various metals  plastics  wood  glass and numerous component parts  including electronic subassemblies and lcd screens 
we believe that our sources of supply of component parts and raw materials are generally adequate 
since january of  we have been implementing cost savings and efficiency initiatives and focusing on best practices  in order to improve the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and reduce time to market 
we continue to make improvements in sourcing and supply management  in inventory and warehouse management  and other manufacturing processes 
we are implementing a new sales operations strategy in an effort to produce gaming machines ratably throughout the quarter  with the goal of significantly reducing or eliminating the quarter end compression in manufacturing 
with further operating efficiency improvements  we expect to level load the shipment of new gaming machines each quarter 
we also have ongoing manufacturing initiatives  such as enhanced strategic sourcing and supplier management  value engineering the product and designing product for both ease of manufacturability and installation  that we expect will help improve gross margins in future quarters 
the european union eu has adopted the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive to facilitate the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment sold in the eu 
the rohs directive restricts the use of lead  mercury  and certain other substances in electrical and electronic products placed on the market in the eu after july  we have worked with our suppliers to develop rohs compliant products and  as of the effective date of the directive  we were able to provide rohs compliant gaming machines to the eu 
we expect that any cost increases incurred due to the rohs directive will be offset by savings from design and other changes we made to our component parts

item a 
risk factors we urge you to carefully review the following discussion of the specific risks and uncertainties that affect our business 
these include  but are not limited to  the following gaming licenses  regulatory approvals and gaming legislation impact our ability to operate our business and sell and lease our products the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines is subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign regulations and taxes  which are amended from time to time 
virtually all of the jurisdictions in which we operate require licenses  permits  documentation of qualification  including evidence of financial stability  and other forms of approval of our company and our officers  directors  major security holders and key personnel 
additionally  the gaming authorities in some jurisdictions may investigate any individual who has a material relationship with us and any security holder to determine whether the individual or security holder is acceptable to those gaming authorities 
any security holder investigated by the gaming authorities must pay the costs of the investigation 
each of our games and gaming machine hardware and software must be approved in each jurisdiction in which it is placed  and we cannot assure you that a particular game or hardware or software will be approved in any jurisdiction 
licenses  approvals or findings of suitability may be revoked  suspended or conditioned 
to expand into new jurisdictions  we may need to be licensed  obtain approvals of our products and or seek licensure of our officers  directors  major security holders  key personnel or business partners 
if we fail to seek  do not receive or receive a revocation of a license in a particular jurisdiction for our games  hardware or software  we cannot sell or place on a participation or leased basis our products in that jurisdiction 
delays in  amendments to or repeals of legislation approving gaming in jurisdictions in which we operate or plan to commence operations  may adversely affect our operations 
delays in approvals of our customers operations may adversely affect our operations 
some jurisdictions require gaming manufacturers to obtain government approval before engaging in some transactions  such as business combinations  reorganizations  borrowings  stock offerings and repurchases 
obtaining licenses and approvals can be time consuming and costly 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain or maintain all necessary registrations  licenses  permits  approvals or findings of suitability or that the approval process will not result in delays or changes to our business plans 
the gaming industry can be affected by public opinion of gaming 
in the event that there is a decline in public acceptance of gaming  either through unfavorable legislation affecting the introduction of gaming into emerging markets  or through legislative and regulatory changes  including tax increases  in existing gaming markets  our ability to continue to sell and lease our gaming machines in those markets and jurisdictions would be adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that public opinion will continue to support legalized gaming 
our profitability depends on our ability to keep up with technological developments and to develop new products the gaming machine business is characterized by the rapid development of new technologies and the continuous introduction of new products using such technologies 
we must continually adapt our products to incorporate new technologies 

table of contents our success also depends on continually developing and successfully marketing new games and gaming machines with strong and sustained player appeal 
a new game or gaming machine will be accepted by casino operators only if we can show that it is likely to produce more revenues to the operator than competitors products 
gaming machines can be installed in casinos on a trial basis  and only after a successful trial period are the machines purchased by the casinos 
if a new product does not achieve significant market acceptance  we may not recover our development and promotion costs 
participation gaming machines are replaced by casino operators if the gaming machines do not meet and sustain revenue and profitability expectations 
therefore  these gaming machines are particularly susceptible to pressure from competitors  declining popularity  changes in economic conditions and increased taxation and are at risk of replacement by the casinos  which would end our recurring revenues from these machines 
our success depends on our ability to avoid  detect  replicate and correct software and hardware anomalies and fraudulent manipulation of our gaming machines and associated software 
our gaming machines and software have experienced anomalies and fraudulent manipulation in the past 
gaming machines may be replaced by casinos and other gaming machine operators if they do not perform according to expectations  or may be shut down by regulators 
additionally  in the event of such issues with our gaming machines and software  substantial engineering and marketing resources may be diverted from other projects to correct these issues  which may delay our other projects 
our competitors have been granted patents covering numerous gaming machine features  bonusing techniques and related technologies 
if our products use processes or other subject matter that is claimed under these existing patents  or if other companies obtain patents claiming subject matter that we use  those companies may bring infringement actions against us 
we might then be forced to discontinue the affected products or be required to obtain licenses from the company holding the patent  if it is willing to give us a license  to develop  manufacture or market our products 
we also might then be limited in our ability to market new products 
we might also be found liable for treble damage claims relating to past use of the patented subject matter if the infringement is found to be willful 
some of our most popular games and gaming machine features  including our monopoly branded games and ticket in  ticket out cashless gaming functionality  are based on trademarks and other intellectual properties licensed from third parties 
our future success may depend upon our ability to obtain  retain and or expand licenses for additional popular intellectual properties in a competitive market 
we are currently negotiating to renew our ticket in  ticket out cashless license 
in the event that we cannot renew and or expand this or other existing licenses  we may be required to discontinue the games using the licensed technology or bearing the licensed marks  or limit our use of such items 
our success may depend in part on our ability to obtain trademark protection for the names or symbols under which we market our products and to obtain copyright protection and patent protection of our proprietary software and other game innovations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to build and maintain goodwill in our trademarks or obtain trademark or patent protection  that any trademark  copyright or issued patent will provide competitive advantages for us or that our intellectual properties will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees regarding our trade secrets and proprietary information  but we cannot assure you that the obligation to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or proprietary information will be honored 
despite various confidentiality agreements and other trade secret protections  our trade secrets and proprietary know how could become known to  or independently developed by  competitors 
we cannot assure you that the new products that we introduce will achieve any significant degree of market acceptance  that the acceptance will be sustained for any meaningful period or that new technology  infringement actions or anomalies may cause casino operators to remove our gaming machines 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current schedule of planned introductions 

table of contents in addition  the occurrence of anomalies in  or fraudulent manipulation of  our gaming machines and software may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other action by gaming regulatory authorities including suspension or revocation of our gaming licenses  or disciplinary action 
we have entered into multiple agreements to license intellectual property including licensing technologies related to alternative solutions as part of our technology improvement plan that  as of june   had a total potential commitment of million 
if we determine that we may not realize the value of any of the commitments  we would record an immediate charge against earnings up to the full amount of these commitments that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in the period in which such determination is made 
during fiscal and  technology licensed under two separate agreements was incorporated into more than of the products we sold or leased and a third license was utilized in leased units which generated over of our consolidated revenues 
if the revenue we expect to generate by the sale or lease of products utilizing these licenses were to substantially decline  we would record an immediate charge against earnings up to the full amount of these commitments in the period in which such decline in expected revenue occurred 
our business is subject to other economic  market  and regulatory risks the gaming machine business is intensely competitive 
some of our competitors are large companies with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
in addition  new competitors may enter our key markets 
obtaining space and favorable placement on casino gaming floors is a competitive factor in our industry 
competitors with a larger installed base of gaming machines than ours have an advantage in retaining the most space and best positions in casinos 
these competitors may also have the advantage of being able to convert their installed machines to newer models in order to maintain their share of casino floor space 
in addition  some of our competitors have developed and sell or otherwise provide to customers centralized player tracking and accounting systems which allow operators to accumulate accounting and performance data about the operation of gaming machines 
we do not offer a centralized player tracking and accounting system and that has put us at a competitive disadvantage 
we face risks associated with doing business in international markets related to political and economic instability and related foreign currency fluctuations 
unstable governments and changes in current legislation may affect the gaming market with respect to gaming regulation  taxation  and the legality of gaming in some markets  as we experienced with the russian market in fiscal the loss or unavailability of one or more of our executive officers or the inability to attract or retain key employees in the future could have an adverse effect on our operations 
customer financing is becoming an increasing prevalent component of the sales process and therefore increases business risk of non payment  especially in emerging markets 
in some instances  our gaming machines are installed in casinos on a trial basis  and only after a successful trial period are the machines purchased by the customers 
these customer financing arrangements delay our receipt of cash and can negatively impact our ability to enforce our rights upon default if the customer is from a foreign country 
our competitors have begun to provide free game theme conversions to customers in connection with product sales 
while we intend to continue to charge our customers for game theme conversions including cpu nxt upgrade kits  we cannot be sure that competitive pressure will not cause us to increase the number of free game theme conversions we offer to our customers  which would decrease the revenue we expect to receive for game theme conversions 
if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use  we may suffer harm to our 
table of contents reputation  fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis  or be unable to properly report on our business and the results of our operations 
additionally  the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud  regardless of the adequacy of those controls 
the use of our rights plan or blank check preferred stock would inhibit the acquisition of wms or have a dilutive effect on our stock 
rights plan 
under our rights plan  each share of our common stock has an accompanying right to purchase convertible preferred stock that permits each holder to purchase shares of our common stock at half price 
the rights become exercisable if any person or entity who at the time of the adoption of the rights plan did not own or more of our common stock subsequently acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock without approval of our board of directors 
we can redeem the rights at 
per right  subject to specified conditions  at any time 
the rights expire in november our board of directors could use this agreement as an anti takeover device to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control 
the use of our rights plan may dilute our common stock 
blank check preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of five million shares of preferred stock with designations  rights and preferences that may be determined from time to time by the board of directors 
accordingly  our board has broad power  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock 
our board of directors could use preferred stock to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control 
our board has no current plans  agreements or commitments to issue any shares of preferred stock 
the existence of the blank check preferred stock  however  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
sumner redstone owns or controls of our outstanding common stock  and may dispose of all or a portion of his remaining stock ownership at any time  which could cause our stock price to decrease 
sumner redstone beneficially owns  shares  or  of our common stock  as reported in amendment no 
to a form d filed with the sec on november  mr 
redstone could sell any or all of his shares at any time on the open market or to a person who wishes to acquire control of us 
such a sale may require prior regulatory approval 
we cannot assure you that any such person would agree with our strategy and business goals described in this report 
sales by mr 
redstone of a large number of shares would likely have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in august  we executed a five year extension through august of a voting trust agreement  which governs the voting rights of all shares of our common stock beneficially owned by mr 
redstone 
risks that impact our customers may impact us if fewer players visit our customers facilities or if our customers are unable to devote resources to purchasing and leasing our products including global geopolitical events such as terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility

we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have agreed to make additional payments of interest on our convertible subordinated notes if we declare a cash dividend on our common stock 
the amount of the payments will be equal to the cash dividends that would be payable to the holders of the notes if the holders had converted their notes into shares of our common stock on the record date for the dividend 
however  no such payment will be made if the dividend that would otherwise trigger the payment causes an adjustment to the note conversion rate

our products consist primarily of multi coin  multi line video gaming machines and we were one of the original developers of such gaming machines in the us market 
we have also developed and sell mechanical reel spinning gaming machines and poker games  which we began shipping to customers in fiscal as part of our efforts to fully serve the gaming machine needs of our casino customers 
our gaming machines are installed in all of the major regulated gaming jurisdictions in the united states  as well as in foreign gaming jurisdictions 
we generate revenue in two principal ways from product sales and from gaming operations 
we generate product sales revenues from the sale of new and used gaming machines and vlts  conversion kits including theme and or operating system conversions  parts  and oem to casinos and other licensed gaming machine operators 
specifically  we derive product sales revenue from the sale of the following product lines multi coin  multi line video gaming machines  mechanical reel spinning gaming machines  poker machines  and parts sales  game conversions  oem and used gaming machines 

table of contents we earn gaming operations revenues from leasing participation games and vlts  and earn royalties that we receive from third parties under license agreements to use our game content 
our gaming operations includes the following product lines participation games 
wms owned gaming machines that we lease based upon any of the following payment methods are referred to as participation games a percentage of the net win of the gaming machines  fixed daily fees  or in the case of wide area progressive gaming machines  a percentage of the amount wagered or a combination of a fixed daily fee and a percentage of the amount wagered 
we have the ability to place these games on a participation basis because the popularity of the brand and the superior performance of the game generates higher wagering and net win to the casinos or gaming machine operators than the games we sell to casinos or other gaming machine operators 
wide area progressive participation games 
a wap system electronically links gaming machines that are located across multiple casinos within a gaming jurisdiction  or across native american gaming jurisdictions 
the linked gaming machines contribute to and compete for large  system wide progressive jackpots and are designed to increase gaming machine play for participating casinos by giving the players the opportunity to win a larger jackpot than on a stand alone gaming machine 
net win per gaming machine on wap systems is generally higher than on a lap or non linked stand alone participation gaming machines 
wap game themes are also used in lap gaming machines or stand alone participation gaming machines in jurisdictions where we do not operate a wap system 
local area progressive participation games 
a lap system electronically links gaming machines that are located within a single casino to a progressive jackpot for that specific casino 
our lap gaming machines feature our proprietary brand  jackpot party progressive and  in those jurisdictions where we do not operate a wap system  powerball 
net win per gaming machine on lap systems is generally higher than on non linked stand alone participation gaming machines on a casino floor  but lower than that of wap games 
stand alone participation games 
we lease participation games on a non linked basis  which we call stand alone games 
casino owned daily fee games 
this category consists of gaming machines where the casino purchases the base hardware of the gaming machine and we lease the top box and game theme to the casino at a lower fixed daily lease fee 
video lottery terminals 
our vlts include both video and mechanical reel spinning gaming machines 
they feature advanced graphics  digital sound effects and music and incorporate many of the same features from our other gaming machines 
we offer a variety of multi game and single themed vlts 
our vlts may be operated as stand alone units or may interface with central monitoring computers operated by government agencies 
our vlts typically are located in places where casino type gaming is not the principal attraction  such as racetracks  bars and restaurants 
we began offering vlts with our cpu nxt operating system and in the bluebird cabinet in the second quarter of fiscal licensing 
we derive revenue from the licensing of game themes and game content 
methods for determining the license or royalty revenue vary  but generally are based on a fixed amount for each licensed game placed in a period  or a fixed daily royalty amount for each game 
we earn license or royalty revenues primarily from multimedia games inc  stargames corporation pty 
ltd 
and bally technologies inc for casino owned daily fee games  casinos also have the option to either lease the complete gaming machine  top box and game theme in which case the unit is classified as a stand alone participation game  or to purchase outright the base gaming machine  top box and game theme at a premium price which is classified as product sales revenue 
in certain jurisdictions  vlt operators purchase outright our vlts and we classify these purchases as product sales revenues 
in other jurisdictions  vlt operators lease our vlts and pay us a lease rate based on the net earnings of the gaming machine 
we classify the lease payments as gaming operations revenues 
we do not include vlts in our installed base of participation games 

table of contents in fiscal and  with all of the approvals in hand for all of our product lines  we expect to grow our market share with our new product lines mechanical reel  video poker  lap jackpot systems and wap jackpot systems 
product lines product sales we now have game themes approved for our video product line on our cpu nxt operating system and have sold over  video gaming machines during fiscal we launched our new low denomination hot hot penny video product series earlier this fiscal year with three new game themes and shipped over  of these gaming machines by june  this product continues to perform very well and we look forward to continuing demand over the coming quarters 
we now have game themes approved for our mechanical reel product line and we sold over  mechanical reel gaming machines during fiscal we have received approvals for five series of three reel mechanical reel games under the can t lose  scroll top  ring  color dotmation and megamultiplier series brand names  plus our four reel mechanical gaming machine 
the five reel mechanical gaming machine is one of the fastest growing product segments on today s casino floors and  during the june quarter  we introduced our hot hot super jackpot series of games which offer our first low denomination mechanical reel games and feature an additional side bet to increase the frequency of the bonus 
this new product is also based on our new mechanical reel platform  powered by cpu nxt 
we launched this product line with three new base games  with additional games to follow 
our poker product line currently includes way action  reel em in poker and world series of poker 
we launched world series of poker in early march as the first branded gaming machine in conjunction with harrah s  the licensor 
the first game is a multi set of traditional poker products leveraging the world series of poker brand name and one of the games includes a bonus feature where players participate in the final table of the world series of poker event 
these games were only at harrah s casinos for most of the june quarter  before we introduced this product line at other casinos 
we commercialize this game as a casino owned daily fee game where the casino purchases the base hardware and leases the top box and game theme for a lower lease price point 
for our video product line  our focus in the near term is to refresh the remainder of our legacy installed base of video gaming machines in casinos through either replacement with new bluebird video gaming machines or through cpu nxt upgrade kits and to recapture video market share and grow our market share 
we also sell replacement parts and game theme conversions for our legacy and bluebird gaming machines 
in addition  we sell cpu nxt upgrade kits  which enable casinos to obtain all the features and functionality of the cpu nxt operating system for a lower price compared to the purchase of a new bluebird gaming machine 
we also sell used games that are acquired on a trade in basis or that were previously placed on a participation basis 
in addition  we manufacture and sell gaming stations in legacy and bluebird cabinets under oem agreements 
customer acceptance of bluebird gaming machines  cpu nxt and our new game themes continues to be favorable 
from the launch of the bluebird product in december through august   we shipped over  bluebird units and over  cpu nxt upgrade kits  and at august  had approximately  open orders for approximately  new bluebird gaming machines and approximately  cpu nxt upgrade units  which we expect to ship over the next four quarters 
we expect order levels to continue at a strong pace as the bluebird gaming machines and new game themes are generating strong average daily revenues for casinos 
we also expect continued strength in game conversion revenues over the next several quarters  as operators decide to refresh their bluebird gaming machines with new game themes and as we continue to deliver our cpu nxt upgrade kits and printer upgrades 

table of contents gaming operations the first wap link we launched was monopoly money in the june quarter which is an instant win wap 
in january  we launched our second instant win wap link  reel heroes  with gaming machines titled a fistful of dollars featuring clint eastwood 
in late march  we launched our third wap link  titled powerball  which is an instant win wap in certain jurisdictions and an annuity jackpot with the option for a lump sum payment in other jurisdictions 
through june   jackpot winners have won an aggregate of over million in wide area progressive jackpots 
at june   we had  wap gaming machines installed in casinos  up from at june  in the december quarter  we plan to launch our fourth wap link  titled reel legends  featuring allan quatermain and dirty harry games 
the powerball wap system includes both video gaming machines and mechanical reel gaming machines based on our new mechanical reel platform powered by cpu nxt 
since inception  the powerball games have performed at over a premium above the initial performance of our prior wap links 
at june   we had powerball wap gaming machines installed and  as of august   we had open orders for over additional units  which we intend to ship over the next two quarters 
fiscal also benefited from the continued success of a new product line for wms that was introduced in the september quarter our jackpot party progressive games

our stand alone games feature  among others  titles under the monopoly  men in black and hollywood squares brands and  in those jurisdictions where we do not operate a wap system  clint eastwood based games 
our stand alone gaming machines generally feature larger mechanical or video top boxes  use market research validated brand licenses and provide game play experiences not possible on a single screen game 
server based gaming we believe that server based gaming sbg will be the next significant technology development in the gaming machine industry 
server based gaming refers to a gaming system in which game content and peripherals are configured  maintained and refreshed over a network that links groups of gaming machines to a remote server that enables custom configuration by operators and may also enable central determination of game outcomes 
server based gaming initiatives will require regulatory approval in gaming jurisdictions prior to any implementation and represent a significant addition to our existing portfolio of product offerings 
our vision for sbg emphasizes enhanced game play and excitement for the player  in addition to the above mentioned functions 
in a networked environment  we believe game play will no longer be limited to an individual gaming machine  rather  we believe sbg will permit game play to be communal among multiple players 
our wide area game enhanced network  or wage net product  is currently undergoing regulatory review  and we expect to launch the first phase of our server based game initiative  monopoly big event  in the december quarter 
it will offer a first of its kind true community gaming experience  where all eligible players win in the bonus round together 
this product has a central server to control the shared communal play  and utilizes the enhanced graphics and game play of our cpu nxt operating platform 
we have designed wage net so that it will support our casino customers existing investment in our bluebird products  and yet enable them to begin to move towards server based gaming 
brand licenses we believe that obtaining and developing brand name intellectual property rights is key to the success of our products 
therefore  we continue to invest in future content and the positioning of wms in order to drive industry innovation through the licensing of important brand name intellectual property rights 

table of contents we have a long term agreement with hasbro  inc for the use of their monopoly brand through calendar year we continue to devote significant development efforts to the monopoly brand and intend to keep doing so in the coming years

we introduced powerball as our third wide area progressive jackpot series late in the march quarter upon receiving regulatory approval in nevada and native american jurisdictions and subsequently introduced powerball in colorado  mississippi  missouri and new jersey during the june quarter 
in addition  we began to launch powerball as a lap product in jurisdictions where we do not operate a wap system and will refresh the powerball brand in fiscal with the new game themes 
we license the hollywood squares brand name from king world productions 
in july  we launched the fourth game in the stand alone participation series  prize spin

we also develop wms branded games for our dual screen series  which we sell as casino owned daily fee games 
in april  we licensed the world series of poker brand from harrah s licensing company 
in early march  we received approvals for the game and  together with harrah s  we launched the first world series of poker branded gaming machines 
technology improvement plan in january  as a result of software anomalies that were present in our legacy operating system that ran our gaming machines  we began to execute a three phase technology improvement plan to first stabilize and then modernize our operating system software 
we completed the first phase of this plan  which included improving the stability of our operating system  by introducing two upgrades 
both upgrades received the appropriate regulatory approvals  and additional gaming jurisdictions may require upgrades in the future 
we have also completed the second phase of our technology improvement plan  which consisted of the development  regulatory approval and introduction of our cpu nxt computer circuit board and operating system 

table of contents in the third phase of the technology improvement plan  we are evaluating specifications and requirements for an even more advanced gaming system and plan to launch our cpu nxt operating system in the june quarter 
we continue to refine the design and specifications to incorporate additional features we desire for this platform and continue to allocate more resources to this longer term effort 
in june  we entered into a wide ranging technology transfer agreement with cyberscan technology inc d b a cyberview technology  cyberview to acquire new technology capabilities 
cyberview designs and develops server based game download and gaming systems and related player stations and equipment 
agreement with multimedia games inc on april   we executed an agreement with multimedia games inc multimedia to expand and extend our relationship to address opportunities in class ii  charitable gaming and  in california  tribal instant lottery gaming venues 
through this agreement  multimedia licenses wms game themes  and we serve as multimedia s primary original equipment manufacturer of gaming cabinets 
in august  we extended the agreement through march  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we licensed to multimedia our extensive game content library  including branded participation games  for exclusive placement subject to our existing commitments in multimedia s central determination system based venues offering class ii  washington state class iii  charity  and california tribal instant lottery game products 
multimedia agreed to purchase a specified minimum number of game licenses annually during the term of the agreement 
additionally  multimedia agreed to purchase minimum quantities of new gaming cabinets for placement in the above noted markets in the form of either legacy cabinets or our bluebird gaming cabinet  including slim line versions of both cabinet styles 
on july   we expanded our existing relationship with multimedia  whereby multimedia will distribute certain wms products in oklahoma and we will sell multimedia oem gaming machines and game licenses for the newly opened mexican market 
the amended agreement provides for a term until april  for these two markets and contemplates an increased annual gaming machine purchase commitment from multimedia relative to the original agreement 
under the terms of the amendment  multimedia has secured the right to distribute our bluebird gaming machines equipped with wms game themes to certain native american tribes in oklahoma under regulatory transfer letters issued by gaming laboratories international inc gli  one of the approved independent gaming testing laboratories for oklahoma 
we have retained the right to market our bluebird gaming products directly to certain native american tribes in oklahoma 
gli recently approved our bluebird gaming machine and over game themes for placement in oklahoma tribal gaming facilities 
the expanded agreement also authorizes multimedia to place wms oem cabinets and game themes in the emerging electronic bingo market in mexico 
earlier this year  multimedia entered into an agreement with a mexico based company that has permits to open and operate bingo and sports books facilities in mexico  ten of which are expected to be operational by may multimedia is obligated to place wms themes in a minimum percentage of multimedia s installed base in mexico over the three year term of the agreement 
adoption of new accounting standard effective july   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  resulting in a change in our method of recognizing share based compensation expense 
specifically  we now record compensation expense for employee stock options  which resulted in million of additional pre tax expense recorded during fiscal  or per after tax diluted share 
total share based payment expense in fiscal was million  pre tax 
had we expensed employee stock options for the twelve months ended june   we estimate that share based compensation expense would have increased by million  pre tax  or per after tax diluted share 
we currently do not anticipate altering the use of restricted stock or the use of stock options as a result of adopting sfas no 
r 
for additional information  see note  principal accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition principle for both product sales and gaming operations is to record revenue when all the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  the product is delivered  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the application of revenue recognition policies is critical due to the nature of product sales contracts we execute 
when multiple product deliverables are included under a sales contract  we allocate revenue to each product based upon their respective fair values against the total contract value and defer revenue recognition on those deliverables where we have not met all requirements of revenue recognition 
fair value is determined based on the prices charged when each element is sold separately 
revenues are recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for the separate elements when the products have value on a stand alone basis and fair value of the separate elements exists 
while determining fair value and identifying separate elements requires judgment  generally fair value and the separate elements are readily identifiable as we also sell those elements unaccompanied by other elements 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  revenues are allocated to each element based on the lesser of the element s relative fair value or the amount that is not contingent on future delivery of another element 
if the amount of non contingent revenues allocated to a delivered element is less than the costs to deliver such services  then such costs are deferred and recognized in future periods when the revenues become non contingent 
for lap and stand alone participation gaming machines  revenues are calculated based on gaming machine performance data provided to us by our customers such as a percentage of the machine s win per day or fixed fee based on the actual number of days the machine was on the casino floor 
due to the timing of the receipt of such performance data  we are required to make estimates of our lap and stand alone participation revenue based on an analysis of the historical data reported to us and taking into account anticipated or known events that may affect the historical trend  such as contract cancellations or additional gaming machine placements at a particular customer s facility 
we compare our estimates to the actual data  once received  and adjust our revenue estimates accordingly 
the application of this policy affects the level of our product sales and gaming operations revenue  cost of product sold  cost of gaming operations  accounts receivable  deferred revenue and accrued expenses 
in fiscal  and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy and we do not anticipate material changes in the near term 
income tax accounting we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  income taxes are provided for amounts currently payable and for amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities based upon differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred income taxes are measured using the enacted tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the differences reverse 
determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities involves judgment 
we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax 
table of contents jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 
we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the provision for income tax expense 
in the event there is a significant  unusual or infrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs 
we modify our annual effective tax rate if facts and circumstances change between quarters 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was  compared with for fiscal no taxes have been provided on undistributed foreign earnings that are planned to be indefinitely reinvested 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements  necessitate that these earnings be distributed  an additional provision for withholding taxes may apply  which could materially affect our future effective tax rate 
as a matter of course  the company is regularly audited by various taxing authorities  and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the company owing additional taxes 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  we believe certain positions are likely to be challenged and we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit 
we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the probability of realizing tax benefits  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax benefit realization are reasonable 
however  final determinations of prior year tax liabilities  either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations  could be materially different than estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions 
the outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision  net income  or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made 
the company believes its tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that it has adequately provided for any known tax contingencies 
at june   we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of the benefit of the million of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet  including the net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credit carry forwards 
accordingly  we only provided a minimal valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets 
in determining the level of required valuation allowance  we considered the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
however  additional valuation allowances could be recorded against these deferred tax assets and charged against income in future periods if our future estimates of amounts realizable are reduced or if the timing of such realization extends beyond our current expectations 
refer also to note  income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
the application of this policy affects the level of our tax expense  current income tax receivables and liabilities  and current and non current deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in fiscal  and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy and we do not anticipate material changes in the near term 
share based compensation expense beginning july   we account for share based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value 
table of contents of share based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
the application of this policy affects the level of our cost of product sales  cost of gaming operations  research and development expenses  selling and administrative expenses  and additional paid in capital 
during fiscal  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy and we do not anticipate material changes in the near term 
allowances for slow moving and obsolete inventories we value inventory based on estimates of potentially excess and obsolete inventory after considering forecasted demand and forecasted average selling prices 
however  forecasts are subject to revisions  cancellations and rescheduling 
actual demand may differ from anticipated demand  and such differences may have a material effect on our financial statements 
demand for legacy parts inventory is subject to technical obsolescence 
inventory on hand in excess of forecasted demand is written down to net realizable value 
in fiscal  we introduced our new bluebird cabinet and cpu nxt gaming platform  and the high demand for these products has accelerated the obsolescence of former legacy product lines 
in response to this  we took steps to address the most challenging components of the legacy inventory  as well as selling back to suppliers excess quantities of certain legacy raw materials 
some customers trade in their legacy gaming machines when they purchase a new bluebird gaming machine 
we either sell these trade ins as is or renovate the legacy gaming machines before resale 
we also sell participation gaming machines as used gaming machines when we no longer need them in our gaming operations business 
we maintain a legacy parts inventory which we use for renovating the trade in games  producing new legacy gaming machines under oem arrangements with multimedia  or selling such parts to casinos and others for our spare parts business 
an active market exists mostly outside of north america for used gaming machines 
when we receive a gaming machine on trade in  we estimate a carrying value for the gaming machine 
the value is based upon an estimate of the condition of the gaming machine  as well as our experience in selling used gaming machines and could change due to changes in demand in general for used gaming machines 
therefore  we review our used gaming machine inventory for impairment on a routine basis 
actual demand for new and used legacy gaming machines may differ from anticipated demand  and such differences may have a material effect on our financial statements 
we sold  and  used gaming machines in fiscal and  respectively 
at june  our inventories included the following amount of legacy product in millions raw materials finished goods total in fiscal  we recorded incremental non cash  pre tax net inventory charges of million to reduce legacy inventory to net realizable value 
in fiscal and  we did not record any incremental inventory charges 
the application of this policy affects the level of our inventory and cost of product sales 
in fiscal and we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy and we do not anticipate material changes in the near term 

table of contents participation gaming machine depreciation we continue to support our installed base of legacy participation gaming machines and continue to review our legacy participation gaming machines for impairment 
historically  we depreciated our legacy participation gaming machines over a two year useful life to a minimal salvage value  while top boxes were depreciated over a two year useful life 
beginning with the introduction of our new bluebird cabinet participation games in june  we depreciate the bluebird participation gaming machines over a three year useful life to a minimal salvage value  while we depreciate the top boxes over one year useful life 
we believe this is a better approximation of the actual useful lives 
a material adverse impact could occur if the actual useful life of the participation gaming machines or top boxes is less than what was used in estimating depreciation expense  or if actual salvage value is less than the anticipated salvage value 
the application of this policy affects the level of our gaming operations machines  accumulated depreciation on gaming operations machines and depreciation expense 
in fiscal  and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy  and the change in depreciable life for the bluebird product did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in fiscal or we do not anticipate material changes in the near term 
intellectual property and licensed technology valuations we license intellectual property and technologies from third parties that we use in our gaming machines 
as part of our contracts with the licensors  we typically provide a minimum commitment and prepay royalties and license fees  usually at the time the contract is signed  even though the product may not be introduced until months or years later 
we capitalize the royalty and license fees advances as royalties  licensed technologies  patents and trademarks 
when products using the licensed intellectual property or technology begin to generate revenue  we begin amortization of the amount advanced 
in cases where the advance represents a paid up license  the advance is amortized based on the estimated life of the asset 
in those cases where the license agreement provides for a royalty to be earned by the licensor for each gaming machine sold or placed on a lease  the advance is amortized based on the royalty rates provided in the license agreement 
in both cases the amortization of the advances are included in cost of product sales if related to a product sale or cost of gaming operations if related to placement or lease of gaming operations machines 
we regularly evaluate the estimated future benefit of royalty advances  as well as minimum commitments not yet paid  to determine amounts unlikely to be realized from forecasted sales or placements of our gaming machines 
if actual or revised forecasts fall below the initial estimate  then we may need to revise the remaining useful life and or record additional charges 
refer also to note  royalties  licensed technologies  patents  and trademarks and note  commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
the application of this policy affects the level of our current assets  non current assets  current liabilities  cost of product sales  cost of gaming operations  research and development expense and selling and general expense 
in fiscal  and  we had no material changes in the critical accounting estimates arising from the application of this policy and we do not anticipate material changes in the near term 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued final interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  fin 
fin creates a single model to address uncertainty in income tax positions and prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition and also excludes income tax accounting from sfas no

fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  
table of contents  and  accordingly  we will adopt fin beginning in fiscal we are in the process of analyzing the potential effects fin will have on the company s results of operations and financial position 
results of operations gulf coast hurricanes during the september quarter  two hurricanes devastated the gulf coast of louisiana and mississippi  which affected the company s facilities and its customers facilities 
we reopened our gulfport  ms facility in november  but incurred  and continue to incur  hurricane related revenue loss from the following items a the inability to deliver orders for new units  many of them premium priced units  and we were unable to install incremental participation games and casino owned daily fee games  b lost revenues per day per machine from participation games  including wap games and casino owned daily fee games  that continued to be inoperable at june   c lost revenues from participation games  including wap games and casino owned daily fee games installed in casinos that were closed immediately after the hurricanes but reopened before june   and d lost new unit  parts sales and conversion revenues 
historically  our participation revenue per day in the mississippi and louisiana markets has been over higher than our overall average 
we carry both property and business interruption insurance 
we expect damage to our leased facility in gulfport to be covered by our property insurance  after the deductible 
in october  we received the first property insurance payment from the insurance company 
we have assessed the usability of the inventory and participation gaming machines damaged in our gulfport facility and added damaged items to our property claim 
the property insurance carries a deductible that was expensed in the september quarter  as was our  contribution to our employee relief fund and other related expenses 
there is no deductible for the business interruption insurance and this coverage began hours after elected officials ordered the evacuation of the areas 
during the june quarter  we received business interruption insurance proceeds of million  representing an initial reimbursement for business interruption losses arising from hurricane katrina  which we recorded in interest and other income  net on the consolidated statements of operations 
we continue to pursue additional insurance claims  but cannot presently estimate the amount or timing of any additional payment 
under the accounting rules for insurance recoveries  we did not record and will not record any additional business interruption recovery until we have an agreement with the insurer as to the amount of the recovery 
russian market we have a distribution agreement with a third party covering russia and certain other countries 
in july  the russian government enacted certain changes to its gaming laws to enhance the regulatory environment in russia 
during this on going regulatory transition  demand for new gaming machines has abated and  as a result  the company only sold new gaming machines to our russian distributor in fiscal  compared to almost  gaming machines in fiscal based on current developments  we anticipate the russian market to begin to return to more normal demand in the latter part of fiscal  but this timing is dependent on the russian legislature s full implementation of changes in the law 
seasonality sales of our gaming machines to casinos are generally strongest in the winter and spring and slowest in the summer months 
in addition  quarterly revenues and net income may increase when we receive a larger number of approvals for new games from regulators than in other quarters  when a game that achieves significant player appeal is introduced or if gaming is permitted in a significant new jurisdiction

as used herein  gross profit and gross margin exclude depreciation expense 
to be consistent with industry practice  in our december quarter we began segregating casino owned daily fee games from our participation games in our gaming operations business 
this resulted in the following adjustments to our fiscal reported information in order to present comparable information for fiscal and participation revenue reported of million to million adjusted  other gaming operations revenue formerly royalty  vlt and other lease revenue reported of to million adjusted  average participation installed base reported of  to  adjusted  total installed participation based at period end reported of  to  adjusted  and average revenue per day per participation machine reported of to adjusted 
total gaming operations revenue and gross profit were not affected by this change in classification 
revenues and gross profit total revenues for fiscal increased  or million  to million from million for fiscal the year over year improvement reflects product sales revenue increases due to a increase in the average selling price of new gaming units resulting from increased sales of premium priced product offerings and product options and list price increases  a million increase in used game revenues  realization of a million earn out 
table of contents from a performance based contract with a lottery commission  an increase in oem sales  and an increase in other product sales revenues 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in new unit shipments due to the impact of casino closings following last summer s gulf coast hurricanes and sale of only new units to russia compared to almost  new units sold to russia in fiscal  as a result of continued regulatory legislative transition  as well as a million decrease in revenues from cpu nxt and game theme conversions 
we sold  used game units  primarily as is to international markets during fiscal  compared to  units in fiscal we shipped  conversion kits in fiscal compared to  conversion kits in fiscal gaming operations participation revenue increases for fiscal of million  primarily due to a increase in the average installed base of participation games and a increase in the average revenue per day from participation games reflecting a greater percentage of higher earning wap and lap gaming machines in the installed base 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in other gaming operations revenues due to lower royalty revenue from decreased purchases or placement of wms games by our licensees 
we expect continued growth in our installed base and average revenue per day of gaming operations machines in future quarters as we continue to roll out new wap and lap participation games in bluebird cabinets 
total gross profit  as used herein excluding depreciation expense  increased  or million  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this improvement reflects higher margin gaming operations were of total revenues in fiscal compared to of total revenues in fiscal  as gaming operations grew faster than product sales in fiscal an increase in the gross margin on product sales revenues to  inclusive of million of share based payment expense for fiscal  from for fiscal  primarily due to a higher average sales price and mix of products sold 
this increase was partially offset by higher sales of low margin used games and lower sales of high margin conversion kits 
the higher mix of used games revenues in overall product sales revenues impacted product sales gross margin by approximately basis points 
a decrease in the gross margin on gaming operations to in fiscal from for fiscal  due primarily to the impact of a greater mix of lower margin wap games and increased jackpot expense  partially offset by the benefit of the growth in the installed base of jackpot party progressive lap products which  as a wms brand  incur no royalty expense 
we continue to expect that the gross margin on bluebird gaming machines will approach the mid range  as we attain the benefits from our strategic sourcing and value engineering initiatives and continue to achieve the benefits from ongoing leveling of the production schedule throughout each quarter 
additionally  our october  price list changes and additional product enhancements are also expected to support margin growth 
operating expenses operating expenses were as follows in millions of dollars year ended june  increase decrease dollar as of revenue dollar as of revenue dollar percent research and development selling and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses 
table of contents research and development expenses were essentially flat year over year 
we have recently begun to increase our staffing  primarily to support the company s increased spending on development initiatives for server based gaming products 
research and development expenses included million and million of share based payment expense in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  with the increase due to the adoption of sfas no 
r on july  during fiscal  we introduced new games for sale and new participation and casino owned daily fee games  compared to the introduction in fiscal of new games for sale and new participation and casino owned daily fee games 
in fiscal  we expect a million increase in research and development spending for server based gaming initiatives  as well as for new game development tools  technological advancements and innovations in game play  in order to both continue to build our game library and enhance the productiveness of our development efforts 
notwithstanding the expected revenue growth  we anticipate that these costs will increase as a percentage of revenues in fiscal and selling and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  or of total revenues  from million  or of total revenues  for fiscal selling and administrative expenses included million  or of total revenues  of share based payment expense in fiscal compared to million  or of total revenues  in fiscal  with the increase due to the adoption of sfas no 
r on july  during fiscal  we began to incur higher payroll related costs due to headcount increases throughout the year  as well as higher marketing  promotion and commission expense 
we anticipate that selling and administrative expenses will increase more modestly in fiscal and and  consequently  we expect that these costs will decline as a percentage of revenues 
fiscal depreciation and amortization expense increased to million from million in fiscal  primarily reflecting the record growth we achieved in our installed base of participation machines in gaming operations throughout fiscal and the company invested million in gaming operations machines  top boxes and related equipment during fiscal the current period investment in gaming operation machines reflects our continual expansion of the installed base of our participation games and continued refreshing of our installed base of participation gaming machines with new game themes 
we expect the investment in gaming operations machines to moderate in fiscal and  as we expect the growth in the installed base of our gaming machines to be lower than the record growth we achieved in fiscal and overall  with higher revenues and improved gross margins  we expect continued expansion in our operating margin in fiscal and  even with the additional spending on research and development initiatives 
interest expense we incurred interest and issuance cost amortization expense of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  primarily related to our convertible subordinated notes and amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest and other income  net during fiscal  we recorded million of net other income  including million of investment income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which amounted to million at june  and million of interest on customer notes receivable 
also in fiscal  we received business interruption insurance proceeds of million  representing an initial reimbursement for business interruption losses arising from hurricane katrina 
in fiscal  we recorded million of net other income  including million of investment income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million of pre and after tax income related to final settlement of tax advances with our former subsidiary  midway games  which we previously fully reserved  and a pre tax gain of million in other income from the license of certain intellectual property of a discontinued business 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal increased to from for fiscal  reflecting increased income in  lower export sales deductions and lower utilization of tax credits as a result of the december  expiration of the research tax credit

impact of inflation during the past three years  the general level of inflation affecting us has been relatively low

see also the fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  tabular summary for information regarding the change in fiscal classifications 

table of contents revenues and gross profit the increase in total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to million in higher new gaming machine sales  million in greater parts  used games  conversion and oem revenues  a million increase in participation revenues and million in higher other gaming operations revenue 
new unit sales increased by to  units in fiscal compared to  new units in fiscal  as we shipped our new bluebird gaming machines to additional jurisdictions after receiving additional regulatory approvals 
we also began shipping our new mechanical reel and poker products  as well as offering a higher number of new game themes 
in fiscal  revenues from parts  used games  conversions and oem revenues increased compared to the prior fiscal year due to an increase in cpu nxt upgrade kits sold during fiscal as we received approvals to sell our new games and conversion kits with the cpu nxt operating system 
the average selling price of new units was  in fiscal the average sales price per new unit increased as higher priced new bluebird units represented a greater proportion of new unit sales during fiscal and we benefited from new premium priced product enhancement features such as marquees and alternative top box shapes and an expanded number of dual screen games that command premium pricing 
we implemented a increase in the list price of bluebird video units in north america effective january  the average installed base of participation gaming machines increased to  units in fiscal from  units in fiscal  while the average revenue per day increased by per day from the prior fiscal year to per day 
in fiscal  we expanded our placement of wap games and we continued to refresh the installed base of legacy participation games with our new bluebird gaming machines 
the increase in the average installed base of participation gaming machines was due to new games offered on our new bluebird gaming cabinet 
the transition of the installed base of legacy gaming machines  which did not support the dual port cashless gaming technology that many customers require  to new games in bluebird cabinets and the natural evolution of our older participation series also impacted the installed base and average revenue per day 
the installed participation base grew  units to  units at june  from june   as we introduced new wap and non linked participation games in the bluebird cabinet 
the success of these new games is accelerating our transition from games in legacy cabinets to new games in bluebird cabinets as we have installed  new games in bluebird cabinets and only  participation games remain in legacy cabinets 
average revenues per day increased due to wap gaming machines  which earn net revenue at about twice the average of our non linked games  becoming a higher percentage of our installed base and as we replaced our legacy participation games with new games in bluebird cabinets 
gaming operations revenues benefited from a increase in other gaming operations revenue in fiscal  primarily due to higher royalties from our licensees increased purchases or placement of wms games 
total gross profit increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal while total gross margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal higher margin gaming operations revenues were only of total revenues in fiscal  compared to of total revenues in fiscal due to the significant increase of product sales revenue in fiscal the gross margin on product sales  after the impact of million of net inventory charges to reduce legacy inventory to net realizable value and million of separation costs related to a reduction in work force  was for fiscal compared to for fiscal  reflecting higher margin on the mix of products sold offset by greater overtime and temporary labor costs in fiscal the gross profit margin on gaming operations decreased to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year  reflecting the lower margins on our wide area progressive games due to the required funding of the progressive jackpot and higher royalties payable to licensors  partially offset by higher royalties received from licensees 
in addition  the number of jackpot payouts on our wap links impacted the margin  as jackpots were awarded in fiscal 
table of contents operating expenses operating expenses in millions of dollars year ended june  increase decrease dollar as of revenue dollar as of revenue dollar percent research and development selling and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses research and development expenses increased million  or to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the increased costs were due to million of separation costs related to a reduction in work force  higher regulatory approval costs incurred for the final approvals for cpu nxt and bluebird  for a greater number of new game themes and for the final legacy operating system upgrade in gli territories  plus headcount increases to fully staff our international game development studios and increased staff for the long term portion of the technology improvement plan 
during fiscal  we introduced new games for sale and new participation and casino owned daily fee games  and in fiscal  we introduced new games for sale and new participation games 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal these cost increases resulted from million of separation costs related to a reduction in work force  higher commissions based on substantially higher revenues  additional headcount  overtime and temporary contract labor for game installs  participation placements and in certain administrative areas due to increased demand and the timing of shipments  additional trade show and marketing costs to continue to support the simultaneous launch of three new product lines and higher equity compensation costs 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  as the level of investment in participation gaming machines for gaming operations increased from fiscal to million with the installation of  new bluebird cabinets during fiscal we generated operating income of million in fiscal  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal the improved operating performance in fiscal resulted from the million increase in gross profit  partially offset by a million increase in research and development expenses  million increase in selling and administrative expenses and million increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
interest expense we incurred interest expense of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively related to our convertible subordinated notes issued in june and july of interest and other income  net in the december quarter  we recorded million of pre and after tax income related to final settlement of tax advances with our former subsidiary  midway games  which we previously fully reserved 
we also recorded a pre tax gain of million in other income from the license of certain intellectual property of a discontinued business 
in addition  we recorded million and million of other income  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  primarily interest and investment income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 

table of contents income taxes the provision for income taxes in fiscal  which includes both current and deferred taxes  was at an effective tax rate of  largely due to higher research and development credits  foreign tax credits  export sales deductions  favorable adjustment of prior years taxes  dividend investment income and foreign income 
the benefit for income taxes in fiscal  which includes both current and deferred taxes  was at an effective tax rate of  largely due to a low net loss and higher research and development credits  foreign tax credits  export sales deductions  dividend investment income and foreign income 
earnings per share our net income was million or per diluted share for the current fiscal year compared to net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the prior fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources our use of cash flow from operations is largely for working capital to support our revenue base 
therefore  in any given reporting period  the amount of cash consumed or generated by operations will primarily relate to the rate of revenue increase or decrease  causing a corresponding change in working capital 
in periods when revenues are increasing  the expanded working capital needs will be funded from available cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  cash from operations  and  if necessary  proceeds from additional borrowings or additional equity offerings 
capital commitments are made for property  plant and equipment and gaming operations equipment  other commitments made relate primarily to licensing or technology agreements to obtain access to third party brands  intellectual properties or technologies that we have not developed internally 
also  we will from time to time issue or retire borrowings or repurchase equity in an effort to maintain a cost effective capital structure consistent with our anticipated capital requirements 
our primary sources of liquidity are existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations  and debt capacity available under our revolving credit facility 
selected balance sheet accounts at june are summarized as follows in millions increase decrease total cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments total current assets a total assets total current liabilities b long term debt stockholders equity net working capital a b includes restricted cash of million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
cash required for funding wap systems jackpot payments is considered restricted cash and is not available for general corporate purposes 
our net working capital decreased million from june   and was affected by the following components an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million and an increase in restricted cash of million as we increased the number of wap jackpots during the year  
table of contents a decrease in short term investments of million since  during the first three months of fiscal  we disposed of our investments in auction market preferred stocks and currently hold our cash in interest bearing accounts with various financial institutions  an increase in net current accounts and notes receivable of million  reflecting the increased level of sales  slightly extended financing terms provided to customers and the impact of having higher unit shipments in the third month of the quarter  a million decrease in inventory  due to a million decrease in raw materials and a million decrease in finished goods arising from our continued implementation of cost savings and efficiency initiatives in our manufacturing processes  as well as  a million increase in current liabilities as increases in accounts payable  compensation related liabilities and jackpot liabilities were partially offset by a decrease in accrued royalties due to the timing of shipments and payments 
we have not experienced significant bad debt expense in any of the periods presented 
we expect to continue to invest in working capital throughout fiscal and  albeit at a lower rate than in prior periods 
as described in note  commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements  we have royalty commitments for brand  intellectual property and technology licenses that are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
see also off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations below for further information regarding significant commitments 
we believe that total cash and cash equivalents of million at june   inclusive of million of restricted cash  and cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our anticipated level of expenses  capital expenditures  cash to be invested in gaming operations machines  the levels of inventories and receivables required in the operation of our business  repurchases of common stock  and the acquisition of orion gaming see subsequent events below for the next year 
in fiscal and  we expect cash flow from operations to continue to increase as we grow market share in our new product lines mechanical reel  poker  and wide area and local area progressive systems 
we do not believe we will need to raise a significant amount of additional capital in the short term or long term  however  we will assess market opportunities as they arise 
convertible subordinated notes at june   we had million of convertible subordinated notes outstanding  bearing interest at maturing on july  the notes are convertible at any time into an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the notes are not callable 
we pay interest on the notes semi annually on january and july of each year  aggregating million annually 
the conversion of the convertible subordinated notes to common stock is dependent on individual holders choices to convert  which is dependent on the spread of the market price of our stock above the conversion strike price of per share  and would reduce our annual interest expense 
none of the holders have converted any of their convertible subordinated notes into our common stock 
our convertible notes are conventional convertible debt instruments in which the holder may only realize the value of the conversion option by exercising the option and receiving a fixed number of shares of our common stock 
revolving credit facility on october   we amended our unused line of credit for million under a revolving credit agreement  due may   to increase the foreign exchange transaction and letter of credit sub limit from million to million 
we did not borrow any amounts on this line during fiscal or in fiscal on may   we entered into a new multi year revolving credit agreement that provides for million of unsecured borrowing through december   including the potential to expand the line up to 
table of contents million  and replaces the million revolving credit facility which would have expired on may  up to million of the credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit 
the new credit agreement requires that we maintain certain financial ratios  which could limit our ability to declare dividends or make any distribution to holders of any shares of capital stock  or redeem or otherwise acquire such shares of our company 
at june   approximately million was available for such purposes under the most restrictive of these covenants  and we were in compliance with the covenants as of june  common stock repurchase program on november   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock over the following twelve months 
the purchases may be made from time to time in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on market conditions 
on august   the company s board of directors approved an expansion and extension of the existing share repurchase authorization 
the share repurchase authorization was increased by million to a total of million and the expiration date was extended until august reflecting fiscal share repurchases  at the time of the expansion  approximately million remained outstanding under the expanded authorization

cash flows summary cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table in millions year ended june  to change net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal  we reclassified our investment and advances in other assets relating to technology and brand license agreements and costs paid to third parties for patents and trademarks from operating activities to investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
refer to note  royalties  licensed technologies  patents  and trademarks to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
operating activities the million increase in cash from operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from several factors  including a million lower investment in operating assets and liabilities during the year ended june  due to a reduction in our inventory levels in fiscal from fiscal by million  due to our continued implementation of cost savings and efficiency initiatives in our manufacturing processes  a reduction in the rate of growth of our accounts and notes receivable during fiscal compared to fiscal that is in line with the rate of growth in our revenues  partially offset by slightly extended payment terms  and 
table of contents a million increase in restricted cash related to increase the number of wap jackpots we offer and management of our current liabilities 
fiscal net income provided million cash flow from operations  an increase of million from net income of million for fiscal  depreciation and amortization expense provided million of cash to operations for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal  and non cash expenses  consisting of mostly share based payment expense in both periods  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the million impact from the required adoption of sfas no 
r  effective july  the million decrease in cash used by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a million increase in net income and a million net increase in depreciation and amortization  non cash expenses  deferred income taxes  and tax benefit from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by a million increase in cash invested in operating assets and liabilities due to growth of our business 
depreciation expense totaled million for fiscal  as compared to million for fiscal we anticipate cash to be provided by operations in fiscal  due to anticipated increases in revenues from higher new unit sales at a higher average selling price  a greater average participation gaming machine installed base  and a higher average revenue per day  partially offset by higher research and development expenses related to the ongoing execution of our technology improvement plan  product approval costs  product line expansion costs and increased game offerings  as well as higher selling and administrative costs due to the increase in our revenues 
investing activities the million increase in cash used by investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to cash used for the purchase of property  plant and equipment for fiscal was million compared with million for fiscal we purchased land and a building near our technology campus in the september quarter and are currently planning new construction in this space beginning in fiscal in the fall of  we began an expansion of our waukegan manufacturing facility and spent million on such expansion during fiscal we expect the total cost of the expansion to be between million and million 
however  on an overall capital expenditure basis for property  plant and equipment  we expect to spend between million and million on capital expenditures during fiscal  and do not anticipate any significant changes in the general trend of our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment in fiscal  cash used for additions to gaming operation machines was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the current period investment in gaming operation machines reflects our continued expansion of the installed base of our participation games and continued refreshing of our games with new game themes 
we expect the investment in gaming operations machines to moderate in fiscal to be between million and million in fiscal  and expect this moderation to continue into fiscal  as we expect the growth in the installed base of our gaming machines to be lower than the record growth we achieved in fiscal and net cash of million was provided from the redemption of short term investments for fiscal  compared to million provided from the redemption of such investments in the comparable prior year period  in addition  we acquired orion financement bv on july  see subsequent developments below for further information 

table of contents the million decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to proceeds from short term investments of million compared to million in fiscal  partially offset by cash used for additions to gaming operation machines of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal in fiscal we had record growth in our installed base and we refreshed our installed legacy base with participation games in our bluebird cabinet using our cpu nxt platform 
financing activities the million decrease in cash provided by financing activities  to cash used in financing activities of million  was primarily due to the receipt of million and million from the exercise of stock options in fiscal and  respectively 
the amount we receive from the exercise of stock options is dependent on individuals choices to exercise options  which are dependent on the spread of the market price of our stock above the exercise price of vested options  and in fiscal we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of million at an average price of per share  compared to no repurchases of common stock in fiscal the million decrease in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the fact that we received net cash of million in july from the exercise of the over allotment option relating to our convertible subordinated notes  partially offset by an increase in cash provided the exercise of stock options 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we are not dependent on off balance sheet financing arrangements to fund our operations 
we utilize financing arrangements for operating leases of equipment and facilities  none of which are in excess of our current needs 
we also have minimum guaranteed royalty payments for intellectual property used in our gaming machines that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
typically  we are obligated to make minimum commitment royalty payments over the term of our licenses and to advance payment against those commitments 
our obligations under these arrangements  under our convertible subordinated notes and other contractual obligations at june   were as follows in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases royalty payments  excluding contingent payments non cancelable raw material purchase orders convertible subordinated notes other  including guaranteed minimums in employment agreements and capital expenditures total the total potential royalty commitments  including payments already made and those contingent upon future events  decreased to million at june  from million at june   due to advances and payments made on existing commitments  partially offset by a slight increase in gross commitments 
potential royalty commitments could continue to increase in the future as we enter into new brand licensing agreements 
see also note  commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents non cancelable raw materials purchase orders increased to million as of june  from million as of june   due to the company entering into formal purchase agreements with certain suppliers during fiscal we do not have any special purpose entities for investment or the conduct of our operations 
we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments  although we have granted stock options  restricted stock  equity based performance units and deferred stock units to our employees  officers  directors and consultants and warrants to a licensor  and we have issued convertible subordinated notes 
subsequent developments acquisition on july   we completed the acquisition of of the outstanding stock of privately held orion financement company bv orion gaming  a netherlands based company that designs  manufactures and sells gaming machines 
the total consideration for orion gaming was million or approximately us million  of which million us million was for debt retirement 
orion gaming stockholders received million us million  comprised of million us million in cash and million us million of wms common stock approximately  shares 
orion gaming s senior management  which has led the company from inception  will remain with the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks in the ordinary course of our business  primarily associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not currently hedge either of these risks  or utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk from our convertible subordinated notes and revolving credit facility 
the notes are at a fixed rate and the revolving credit facility is at a variable rate 
as of june   we had million of convertible fixed rate debt with an interest rate of and a fair value of million 
using a discounted cash flow model  and assuming no change in the market price of our common stock into which the debt is convertible  we currently estimate that a basis point change in the prevailing market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately million  but would not be material to our cash flows or future results of operations 
however  the fair value of our convertible fixed rate debt is more significantly dependent on the market price of our common stock into which it can be converted 
on may   we entered into a new multi year revolving credit agreement that provides for million of unsecured borrowing through december   including the potential to expand the line up to million  and replaces the million revolving credit facility which would have expired on may  borrowings under this facility bear interest at a certain percentage above the agent s prime rate  or above the libor rate 
there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of june  foreign currency risk we have subsidiaries in australia  canada  slovakia  spain  south africa  and the united kingdom for distribution and development operations 
these subsidiaries transact business in their respective foreign 
table of contents currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we estimate that a hypothetical strengthening or weakening of the us dollar for fiscal would have resulted in a pretax loss or gain of about million 
the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency translation gains and losses  which are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
such translation resulted in unrealized losses of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  foreign governments could impose restrictions on currency movements that might make it costly or impossible to repatriate earnings to the us the above analysis of foreign currency risk excludes orion gaming  which we acquired in july
