results of operations and financial condition are discussed separately by segment  which corresponds with the industry groupings 
the company manages its lift truck operations as two reportable segments wholesale manufacturing and retail distribution 
nacco housewares group housewares also consists of two reportable segments hamilton beach proctor silex  inc hb ps and the kitchen collection  inc kci 
results by segment are also summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this form k

nmhg designs  engineers  manufactures  sells  services and leases a comprehensive line of lift trucks and aftermarket parts marketed globally under the hyster and yale brand names 
nmhg manages its operations as two reportable segments wholesale manufacturing nmhg wholesale and retail distribution nmhg retail 
nmhg wholesale includes the manufacture and sale of lift trucks and related service parts  primarily to independent and wholly owned hyster and yale retail dealerships 
lift trucks and component parts are manufactured in the united states  northern ireland  scotland  the netherlands  china  italy  japan  mexico  the philippines and brazil 
nmhg retail includes the sale  leasing and service of hyster and yale lift trucks and related service parts by wholly owned retail dealerships and rental companies

the north american coal corporation and its affiliated coal companies collectively nacoal mine and market lignite coal primarily as fuel for power generation and provide selected value added mining services for other natural resources companies in the united states 
lignite coal is delivered to power plants adjacent to nacoal s mines in texas  north dakota  louisiana and mississippi and dragline mining services are provided for independently owned limerock quarries in florida which operate under the name  north american mining company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities if any 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product discounts and returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  product liabilities  restructuring  closed mine obligations  pensions and other post retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  actuarial valuations and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
product liabilities the company provides for the estimated cost of personal and property damage relating to the company s products 
reserves are recorded for estimates of the costs for known claims and estimates of the costs of incidents that have occurred but for which a claim has not yet been reported to the company  in excess of available insurance coverage 
while the company engages in extensive product quality reviews and customer education programs  the company s product liability provision is affected by the number and magnitude of claims of alleged product related damage and the cost to defend those claims 
in addition  the provision for product liabilities is also affected by changes in assumptions for medical costs  inflation rates  trends in damages awarded by juries and estimates of the number of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
changes to the estimate of any of these factors could result in a material change to the company s product liability provision causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating results in the period of change in the estimate 
closed mine obligations the company s wholly owned subsidiary  bellaire corporation bellaire  is a non operating subsidiary with legacy liabilities relating to closed mining operations  primarily former eastern us underground mining operations 
these legacy liabilities include obligations for black lung and other retiree medical benefits  mine water treatment and obligations to the united mine workers of america umwa combined benefit fund the fund arising as a result of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal act 
provisions made by bellaire for these liabilities include estimates of the number of beneficiaries assigned to bellaire  medical cost trend rates  inflation rates  actuarially determined mortality tables  cost of ongoing mine water treatment  discount factors and legal costs to defend claims 
in addition  these liabilities can be influenced by judicial proceedings  legislative actions and changes in regulations made by government agencies 
the company continually monitors the regulatory climate which could influence these liabilities as well as the assumptions used to 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc 
and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share and percentage data develop accruals for these liabilities 
changes in any of these factors could materially change the company s estimates for these closed mine obligations causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating results in the period of change in the estimate 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for further discussion of closed mine obligations 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
changes in management s judgments and estimates could significantly affect the company s analysis of the impairment of goodwill 
to test goodwill for impairment  the company is required to estimate the fair value of each of its reporting units 
since quoted market prices in an active market are not available for the company s reporting units  the company uses other valuation techniques 
the company has developed a model to estimate the fair value of the reporting units  primarily incorporating a discounted cash flow valuation technique 
this model incorporates the company s estimates of future cash flows  allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units  future growth rates and management s judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used to discount those estimated cash flows 
changes to these judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units which could result in an impairment of goodwill 
revenue recognition revenues are generally recognized when title transfers and risk of loss passes as customer orders are completed and shipped 
for nmhg s national account customers  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance 
national account customers are large customers with centralized purchasing and geographically dispersed operations in multiple dealer territories 
under its mining contracts  the company recognizes revenue as the coal is delivered and limerock is mined 
reserves for discounts  returns and product warranties are maintained for anticipated future claims 
the accounting policies used to develop these product discounts  returns and warranties include product discounts the company records estimated reductions to revenues for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing agreements  price competition  promotions and other volume based incentives 
at nmhg  truck sales revenue is recorded net of projected discounts 
the estimated discount amount is based upon historical trends for each truck model 
in addition to standard discounts  dealers can also request additional discounts that allow them to offer price concessions to customers 
from time to time  nmhg offers special incentives to increase retail share or dealer stock and offers certain customers volume rebates if a specified cumulative level of purchases is obtained 
at hb ps  net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances based primarily on volume purchasing levels  estimated returns and allowances for defective products 
at kci  retail markdowns are incorporated into kci s retail method of accounting for cost of sales 
if market conditions were to decline or if competition was to increase  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
product returns products generally are not sold with the right of return 
however  based on the company s historical experience  a portion of products sold are estimated to be returned due to reasons such as buyer remorse  duplicate gifts received  product failure and excess inventory stocked by the customer which  subject to certain terms and conditions  the company will agree to accept 
the company records estimated reductions to revenues at the time of sale based on this historical experience and the limited right of return provided to certain customers 
if future trends were to change significantly from those experienced in the past  incremental reductions to revenues may result based on this new experience 
product warranties the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenues are recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  labor costs and replacement component costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  labor costs or replacement component costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which would affect net income 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserves the company writes down its inventory to the lower of cost or market  which includes an estimate for obsolescence or excess inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
upon a subsequent sale or disposal of the impaired inventory  the corresponding reserve for impaired value is relieved to ensure that the cost basis of the inventory reflects any write downs 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc 
and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share and percentage data deferred tax valuation allowances the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
a valuation allowance has been provided against certain deferred tax assets related to non us and non us state jurisdiction net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
management believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income  allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount including the valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
conversely  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made 
self insurance liabilities the company is generally self insured for product liability  environmental liability  medical and workers compensation claims  certain closed mine liabilities and obligations to the fund arising as a result of the coal act 
an estimated provision for claims reported and for claims incurred but not yet reported under the self insurance programs is recorded and revised periodically based on industry trends  historical experience and management judgment 
in addition  industry trends are considered within management s judgment for valuing claims 
changes in assumptions for such matters as legal judgments and settlements  legal defense costs  inflation rates  medical costs and actual experience could cause estimates to change in the near term 
for product liability  catastrophic coverage is retained for potentially significant individual claims 
retirement benefit plans the company maintains various defined benefit pension plans 
in  pension benefits for certain nacoal employees  excluding certain unconsolidated project mining subsidiary employees  were frozen 
in  pension benefits were frozen for employees covered under nmhg s and hb ps us defined benefit plans  except for those nmhg employees participating in collective bargaining agreements 
as a result  in the united states only certain nmhg employees covered under collective bargaining agreements will earn retirement benefits under defined benefit pension plans 
other employees of the company  including employees whose pension benefits were frozen  will receive retirement benefits under defined contribution retirement plans 
the company s policy is to periodically make contributions to fund the defined benefit pension plans within the range allowed by applicable regulations 
the defined benefit pension plan assets consist primarily of publicly traded stocks  investment contracts and government and corporate bonds 
there is no guarantee that the actual return on the plans assets will equal the expected long term rate of return on plan assets or that the plans will not incur investment losses 
the basis for the selection of the discount rate at each september measurement date is determined by matching the timing of the payment of the expected pension obligations under the defined benefit plans against the corresponding yield of moody s average corporate bonds of equivalent maturities 
the expected long term rate of return on defined benefit plan assets reflects management s expectations of long term rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligations 
the company has established the expected long term rate of return assumption for plan assets by considering historical rates of return over a period of time that is consistent with the long term nature of the underlying obligations of these plans 
the historical rates of return for each of the asset classes used by the company to determine its estimated rate of return assumption at its september measurement date were based upon the rates of return earned by investments in the equivalent benchmark market indices for each of the asset classes over the time period from january  to september  and during periods of both significant market gains as well as depressed market returns  the company has held to a consistent expected rate of return assumption 
changes to the estimate of any of these factors could result in a material change to the company s pension obligation causing a related increase or decrease in reported net operating results in the period of change in the estimate 
the company also maintains health care and life insurance plans which provide benefits to eligible retired employees 
during  due to the significantly rising costs associated with these plans  nacoal announced a change in eligibility requirements  generally limiting the plan to those hired before january   changing the retirement age and years of service requirements for retiree medical coverage  and implementing a cap on nacoal s share of annual medical costs  which includes freezing benefits for those hired before january  all other health care and life insurance plans of the company previously implemented a cap on the company s share of the costs 
the plans have no assets 
under the company s current policy  plan benefits are funded at the time they are due to participants 
the basis for the selection of the discount rate at each september measurement date is determined by matching the timing of the payment of the expected obligations under the health care and life insurance plans against the corresponding yield of moody s average corporate bonds of equivalent maturities

and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share and percentage data consolidated income taxes the company s income tax provision includes us federal  state and local  and foreign income taxes 
in determining the effective income tax rate  the company analyzes various factors  including the company s annual earnings  taxing jurisdictions in which the earnings will be generated  the impact of state and local income taxes  the company s ability to use tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards  and available tax planning alternatives 
discrete items  including the effect of changes in tax laws  tax rates  certain circumstances with respect to valuation allowances or other unusual or non recurring tax adjustments are reflected in the period in which they occur as an addition to  or reduction from  the income tax provision  rather than included in the effective income tax rate

these benefits were offset during by the elimination of deferred tax assets which nmhg wholesale will not be able to recognize due to state income tax law changes enacted in ohio 
in addition  the financial results of the company reflect the impact of the repatriation provisions included in the american jobs creation act of the jobs act 
the company repatriated earnings of million subject to the dividend exclusion provisions of the jobs act and 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nacco industries  inc

also as a result of the jobs act  nmhg wholesale benefited from the recognition of certain foreign tax credits previously written off 
nmhg retail during  the effective income tax rate for nmhg retail was favorably affected by the benefit of a settlement of a foreign income tax claim in asia pacific 
during  nmhg retail reversed million in valuation allowances related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result of non us tax law changes  nmhg retail now expects to utilize these foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
hb ps hb ps recognized a tax benefit related to the settlement of audits and transfer pricing disputes with various taxing authorities in nacoal during  nacoal recorded a tax benefit for the resolution of tax issues related to state income taxes 
nacco and other during  nacco and other recorded a tax benefit related to the recognition of previously generated losses in europe 
during both and  nacco and other recorded tax benefits for the resolution of tax issues provided for in prior years related to state income taxes at bellaire 
excluding the impact of the discrete items discussed above  the effective income tax rates for the years ended december   and are gradually declining  primarily due to a shift in the mix of earnings to jurisdictions with lower effective income tax rates and the increased effect of the other permanent items noted in the table above 
in addition  the company s consolidated effective income tax rate is lower than the statutory income tax rate primarily due to the benefit of percentage depletion at nacoal combined with both equity earnings in unconsolidated subsidiaries and foreign tax rate differential at nmhg wholesale

the company manages its operations as two reportable segments nmhg wholesale and nmhg retail 
nmhg wholesale includes the manufacture and sale of lift trucks and related service parts  primarily to independent and wholly owned hyster and yale retail dealerships 
nmhg retail includes the sale  leasing and service of hyster and yale lift trucks and related service parts by wholly owned retail dealerships and rental companies 
nmhg retail includes the elimination of intercompany revenues and profits resulting from sales by nmhg wholesale to nmhg retail 
within the overall lift truck industry  lift truck customers increasingly require more dependable lift trucks and greater levels of service and expect manufacturers and dealers to deliver both at competitive prices 
therefore  maintaining low costs as well as providing outstanding quality and reliability are critical for competitiveness 
because economies of scale are directly related to maintaining low costs  the industry is led by large  global manufacturers with an increasingly global supply base 
regardless of scale  materials price increases and fluctuations in currency exchange rates have made net cost reductions challenging in the last several years 
in this environment  continual improvements in manufacturing and supply chain efficiencies are critical to success 
while cost and dependability are important  customers also increasingly desire specialized solutions for their materials handling needs and the market is demanding a more rapid product development cycle 
manufacturers must strike the right balance between the number of models and options offered and the volume required to maintain efficiencies and economies of scale 
as logistics efficiency grows in importance to end users  the overall product and service needs of these customers become more sophisticated 
manufacturers face increasing demand for enhanced services  including national and global sales  financing options  and maintenance and parts coordination 
as a result  successful lift truck companies and dealers have highly professional personnel and business processes and foster strong  lasting customer relationships 
nmhg has established strategies and key programs aimed at addressing current industry trends 
these strategies and key programs include quality and efficiency  flexible and modular products  and sales and service excellence 
each key program is designed to enhance profitability or generate growth  both of which are critical for achieving nmhg s goals in this mature industry 
profitability programs at nmhg focus mainly on manufacturing and supply chain efficiency  while growth programs focus on increasing country and industry market share positions by addressing customer needs with an optimal package of products and services

restructuring plan as announced in december  nmhg wholesale phased out its lenoir  north carolina lift truck component facility and restructured other manufacturing and administrative operations  primarily its irvine  scotland lift truck assembly and component facility 
as such  nmhg wholesale recognized a restructuring charge of approximately million during  of which million related to a non cash asset impairment charge and million related to severance and other employee benefits to be paid to approximately manufacturing and administrative employees 
severance payments began in and are expected to continue through these actions were designed to essentially complete the restructuring of nmhg wholesale s global manufacturing facility infrastructure 
previously announced programs  such as demand flow technology  selected component outsourcing and innovative lift truck designs have enabled nmhg to maintain substantially unchanged lift truck production capacity in fewer facilities and at a reduced cost 
the lenoir plant s lift truck component operations  including mast and cylinder manufacturing  were consolidated into plants in sulligent  alabama  berea  kentucky  and greenville  north carolina 
the irvine assembly and component facility was restructured to an appropriately sized operation 
the restructured facility will manufacture three and four wheel electric rider lift trucks and mast components for the european market 
other lift truck components currently manufactured in irvine will be outsourced to independent suppliers 
during  severance payments totaling million were made to approximately employees 
additionally in  million of the amount accrued at december  was reversed as a result of a reduction in the estimate of employees eligible to receive severance payments as well as a reduction in the average amount to be paid to each employee 
during  severance payments totaling million were made to approximately employees 
in addition  million of the amount originally accrued for severance was reversed as a result of employees leaving prior to becoming eligible for severance benefits and an additional decrease in the total number of employees estimated to be severed as a result of an increase in estimates of future production levels

adjustments to reserves booked against these assets  including inventory reserves  will change the eligible borrowing base and thereby impact the liquidity provided by the nmhg facility 
at december   the borrowing base under the nmhg facility was million  which has been reduced by the commitments or availability under certain foreign credit facilities and an excess availability requirement of million 
there were no domestic borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  the nmhg facility includes a subfacility for foreign borrowers which can be denominated in british pound sterling or euros 
included in the borrowing capacity is a million overdraft facility available to foreign borrowers 
at december   there was million outstanding under these foreign subfacilities 
during  nmhg issued million of senior notes that mature on may  the senior notes 
the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of nmhg holding co 
and are guaranteed by substantially all of nmhg s domestic subsidiaries 
nmhg holding co 
has the option to redeem all or a portion of the senior notes on or after may  at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the senior notes 
the proceeds from the senior notes were reduced by an original issue discount of million 
in addition to the amount outstanding under the senior notes  nmhg had borrowings of approximately million at december  under various working capital facilities 
both the nmhg facility and terms of the senior notes include restrictive covenants which  among other things  limit the payment of dividends to nacco to no greater than million annually  subject to additional restrictions and limitations 
the nmhg facility also requires nmhg to meet certain financial tests  including  but not limited to  minimum excess availability  maximum capital expenditures  maximum leverage ratio and minimum fixed charge coverage ratio tests 
the borrowers must maintain aggregate excess availability under the revolving credit facility of at least million 
at december   nmhg was in compliance with all covenants 
nmhg believes that funds available under the nmhg facility  other available lines of credit and operating cash flows will provide sufficient liquidity to meet its operating needs and commitments arising during the next twelve months and until the expiration of the nmhg facility in december in addition  nmhg is considering alternatives to enable it to refinance portions of its current outstanding debt  including the redemption of its senior notes in accordance with the terms and conditions of those securities 
there can be no assurances that nmhg will be able to secure financing in amounts or at terms that would enable nmhg to complete any contemplated refinancing

the initial proceeds from the senior notes received in were reduced by an original issue discount of million 
the unamortized balance of this discount at december  is million 
therefore  the amount recognized as senior notes in the consolidated balance sheet at december  is million 
an event of default  as defined in the indenture governing nmhg s senior notes  in nmhg s revolving credit facilities  in nmhg s term loan agreements and in nmhg s operating and capital lease agreements  could cause an acceleration of the payment schedule 
no such event of default has occurred under these agreements 
pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation and the company s funding decisions to contribute any excess above the minimum legislative funding requirements 
as a result  pension and postretirement funding has not been included in the table above 
pension benefit payments are made from assets of the pension plans 
nmhg expects to contribute approximately million and million to its us and us pension plans  respectively  in nhmg expects to make payments related to its other postretirement plans totaling approximately million over the next ten years 
benefit payments beyond that time cannot currently be estimated 
in addition  nmhg has the following commitments  stated at the maximum undiscounted potential liability  at december  total standby recourse obligations guarantees or repurchase obligations total commercial commitments standby recourse obligations  guarantees or repurchase obligations primarily represent contingent liabilities assumed by nmhg to support financing agreements made between nmhg s customers and third party finance companies for the customer s purchase of lift trucks from nmhg 
for these transactions  nmhg generally retains a perfected security interest in the lift truck  such that nmhg would take possession of the lift truck in the event that nmhg would become liable under the terms of the standby recourse obligations  guarantees or repurchase obligations 
generally  these commitments are due upon demand in the event of default by the customer 
the security interest is normally expected to equal or exceed the amount of the commitment 
to the extent that nmhg would be required to provide funding as a result of these commitments  nmhg believes that the value of its perfected security interest and amounts available under existing credit facilities are adequate to meet these commitments in the foreseeable future 
the amount of the standby recourse or repurchase obligations increase and decrease over time as obligations under existing arrangements expire and new obligations arise in the ordinary course of business 
losses anticipated under the terms of the standby recourse obligations  guarantees or repurchase obligations are not significant and reserves have been provided for such losses in the consolidated financial statements

the previously noted benefits are expected to be partially offset by one time product development and related introduction costs  as well as start up manufacturing inefficiencies in related to the new lift truck series to be launched 
additional  however less material  offsets to the favorable effects of the new lift trucks  are costs attributable to the remaining portion of the previously announced irvine manufacturing restructuring program and production line movements  which will take place in the second half of price increases implemented in prior periods are expected to continue to offset the effect of anticipated higher material costs in while these pricing actions are expected to have a significant impact on margin recovery in  full recovery of the accumulated material cost increases incurred since the end of is not anticipated until although cost increases have leveled off in the past few quarters  higher energy prices could result in further increases in the costs of raw materials and higher fuel costs are expected to raise shipping costs

because the housewares business is seasonal  a majority of revenues and operating profit occurs in the second half of the year when sales of small electric appliances to retailers and consumers increase significantly for the fall holiday selling season 
at hb ps  margin pressure in the housewares industry continues to be intense as both competitors and retail customers consolidate 
in addition  increasing costs of freight and raw materials such as plastic  copper  aluminum and steel continue to add further pressure on margins 
in response  hb ps and other housewares manufacturers have transferred a significant portion of their manufacturing to lower cost regions  primarily in asia 
new  innovative products tend to drive growth and higher margins in the marketplace 
against a backdrop of growing interest in home cooking  many new products aimed at this market  particularly those promoted on television  have been well received by consumers 
brand names continue to be important in small kitchen appliances  with the importance of these names varying across consumer segments and markets 
however  the overall market growth rate in small kitchen appliances is relatively low and products face increasing competition for consumers disposable income from consumer electronics and other gift items 
strong relationships with the leading small kitchen appliance retailers  which continue to grow in size  are critical for success 
shelf placement is highly competitive and sales are increasingly driven by promotional activity in the fourth quarter holiday season which delivers a significant portion of annual sales 
hb ps has established strategies and key programs aimed at responding to these industry trends 
these strategies and programs focus on continuous cost reduction  innovation  and professional sales and marketing 
each key program is designed to enhance profitability or generate growth 
profit enhancement programs focus on efficiencies in product development  manufacturing and the supply chain  while growth programs focus on new product innovations  branding and distribution channel optimization 
at kci  the outlet mall industry expanded rapidly during the s and has now slowed as consumers find comparable values in many channels  including mass retailers and the internet 
in addition  consumer traffic at many outlet malls has declined recently due primarily to the cost of reaching their out of the way locations given higher gasoline prices 
certain outlet malls have retained their strength while some have struggled 
success in outlet malls has shifted more to optimizing performance in each existing store than expansion to new outlet malls 
however  there remain significant growth opportunities for kci  particularly in the mid price niche  and in other channels  such as traditional enclosed malls 
kci has established strategies and key programs geared to these current industry trends 
kci s strategies and key programs are focused on disciplined cost control  unique affordable products and format improvement and expansion 
programs designed to enhance profitability are especially important in this period of reduced outlet mall traffic 
in addition  programs to identify and offer unique affordable products and to improve upon and expand its store formats outside of outlet malls are increasingly important for generating growth

and subsidiaries tabular amounts in millions  except per share and percentage data the north american coal corporation overview nacoal mines and markets lignite coal primarily as fuel for power generation and provides selected value added mining services for other natural resources companies 
lignite is surface mined in north dakota  texas  louisiana and mississippi 
total coal reserves approximate billion tons with approximately billion tons committed to customers pursuant to long term contracts 
nacoal has six lignite mining operations the coteau properties company coteau  the falkirk mining company falkirk  the sabine mining company sabine  san miguel lignite mining operations san miguel  red river mining company red river and mississippi lignite mining company mlmc 
nacoal also provides dragline mining services limerock dragline mining operations for independently owned limerock quarries in florida 
at nacoal  safety and efficiency are critical to providing value in the mining industry 
operational costs are highly sensitive to changes in mining routines 
when difficult mining situations emerge  pressure is put on profitability 
recently  increases in diesel fuel cost and the availability and cost of tires for mining equipment have created additional challenges 
successful companies must remain vigilant about containing costs  even when mining contracts are designed to cover cost increases 
additionally  lignite coal customers  primarily electric power plants  are under constant pressure from their end users to provide affordable power in an environmentally sensitive manner 
since mining is a relatively mature industry  it is imperative for mining companies to develop new  innovative processes to remain competitive 
new opportunities and growth in the mining industry can arise in traditional coal and aggregates mining as well as in new areas  such as coal based fuel production 
in certain regions of the united states  the demand for local power is increasing 
in these as well as other regions  power companies that have traditionally mined their own lignite are considering contract mining 
significant advances in traditional power generation technology  along with sharp increases in the price of natural gas  have increased the probability that new coal fired power plants will be built over the next several years 
in addition  many energy companies are now considering completely new coal based energy technologies  such as gasification  coal to liquids and other coal enhancement processes 
nacoal expects to continue to play a leadership role in the evolving energy  environmental and national energy policy landscape in the united states with the objective of capitalizing on a growing need for low cost coal based domestic energy sources 
nacoal has established several strategies and key programs to respond to these current industry trends 
the programs  designed to enhance profitability or generate growth  include low cost mining expertise  mining and reclamation innovation  and new business opportunities

at the consolidated coal mining operations  the decrease in operating profit was primarily attributable to higher commodity costs  mainly for diesel fuel  which are expected to be recovered to some extent in future periods through contractual price escalation  and increased costs to perform repairs and maintenance at the mines 
in addition  operating profit decreased as a result of lower operating results at mlmc as a result of fewer tons delivered  mainly from reduced customer requirements  as well as adverse geological mining conditions 
the decrease in operating profit at the limerock dragline mining operations was primarily due to increased start up costs related to the commencement of two new dragline mining service operations during  increased costs related to new dragline equipment put into service  delays from the movement of equipment and delays caused by numerous hurricanes in the southern florida and gulf coast regions 
selling  general and administrative costs increased primarily from higher employee related costs and higher professional service fees 
the reduction in operating profit was partially offset by increased royalty income and an increase in the earnings of unconsolidated project mining subsidiaries due to contractual price escalation and increased tons delivered 
net income in decreased to million from million in as a result of the factors affecting operating profit and increased interest expense  partially offset by lower income tax expense 
the increase in interest expense was due to an increase in external borrowings at higher interest rates and a decrease in internal borrowings from nacco  which were at lower interest rates

favorable pricing is primarily attributable to better quality coal being mined and increased contractually negotiated pass through revenue at mlmc  favorable contract changes at san miguel  and contractually required price escalation 
increased production at the limerock dragline mining operations is mainly a result of the commencement of dragline mining at additional limerock quarries during the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of revenues also increased due to increased royalty income
