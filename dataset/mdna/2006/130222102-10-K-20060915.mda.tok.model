item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s results include the operations of calfirst leasing  amplicon  and calfirst bank 
the company s direct finance income includes interest income earned on the company s investment in lease receivables and residuals 
other income primarily includes gains realized on the sale of leased property  income from sales type and operating leases and gains realized on the sale of leases  and other fee income 
income from sales type leases relates to the re lease of off lease property lease extensions and new lease transactions that qualify as sales type leases  generally where the fair value of the property subject to the lease differs from the company s carrying cost 
income from operating leases generally involves lease extensions that are booked as operating leases rather than as a sales type leases 
the company s operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations resulting from a variety of factors  including the volume and profitability of leased property being re marketed through re lease or sale  the size and credit quality of the lease portfolio  the interest rate environment  the volume of new lease originations  including variations in the mix and funding of such originations  and economic conditions in general 
the company s principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk  which is the exposure due to differences in the repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s interest bearing liabilities represent less than of total assets  and therefore  changes in interest rates in general have a greater impact on the yield earned on the investment in lease receivables  securities and other interest earning assets  with less impact from higher or lower interest expense 
however  a flattening of the yield curve does result in some impact to earnings due to the compression of earning asset yields and funding rates  while a steepening would result in increased earnings as investment margins widen 
the company conducts its business in a manner designed to mitigate risks 
however  the assumption of risk is a key source of earnings in the leasing and banking industries and the company is subject to risks through its investment in lease receivables held in its own portfolio  lease transactions in process  and residual investments 
the company takes steps to manage risks through the implementation of strict credit management processes and on going risk management review procedures 
restatement subsequent to the issuance of the company s june  financial statements  the company determined that a restatement of prior period results needed to be made to correctly account for certain lease extensions as operating leases instead of as sales type leases  and certain information in the consolidated statements of cash flows should be restated to comply with the guidance under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 statement of cash flows sfas no 

accounting for lease extensions a review of the accounting for lease extensions accounted for as sales type leases identified that certain lease extensions classified as sales type leases should have been classified as operating leases 
the difference in lease classification results in different timing of income recognition within the extension term and a change in classification of such leases on the balance sheet from net investment in capital leases to property on operating leases 
the following tables summarize the impact of the adjustments relating to the reclassification of certain lease extensions on affected line items within the company s previously reported statements of earnings for the years ended june  and the restatement has an immaterial effect on california first national bancorp and subsidiaries consolidated balance sheets at the end of each of the stated periods and has no effect on the timing or amount of actual cash flows

the restatements will solely affect the classification of these activities and the subtotals of cash flows from operating and investing activities presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows  but they will have no impact on the net change in cash and cash equivalents set forth in such statements of cash flows for any of the previously reported periods 
the following table summarizes the effects of the restatement of the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended june  and the reclassification of the items noted above has the effect of decreasing the reported cash provided from operating activities and increasing the cash flow used in investing activities as compared to the company s previously issued financial statements

these accounting estimates are based on management s judgment and are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from current judgments  or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates 
the following is a description of the most critical accounting policies management applies  all of which require the use of accounting estimates and management s judgment  based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
california first national bancorp and subsidiaries residual values for capital leases that qualify as direct financing leases  the aggregate lease payments receivable and estimated residual value  if any  are recorded on the balance sheet  net of unearned income and allowances  as net investment in capital leases 
of the volume of capital leases booked during the fiscal years ended june   and  approximately  and  respectively  were structured such that the company owns the leased asset at the end of the term and therefore  the company recorded a residual value 
the residual value is an estimate for accounting purposes of the fair value of the leased property at lease termination and is determined at the inception of the lease based on the property leased and the terms and conditions of the underlying lease contract 
the realizability of any estimated residual value depends on future collateral values  contractual options available to the lessee  the credit of the lessee  market conditions and other subjective and qualitative factors 
the estimated residual values established at lease inception are periodically reviewed to determine if values are realizable and any identified losses are recognized at such time 
allowance for lease losses the allowance for lease losses provides coverage for probable and estimatable losses in the company s lease portfolios 
the allowance recorded is based on a quarterly review of all leases outstanding and transactions in process 
the determination of the appropriate amount of any provision is based on management s judgment at that time and takes into consideration all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect the lease portfolio  including levels of non performing leases  lessees financial condition  leased property values as well as general economic conditions and credit quality indicators 
the company s allowance includes an estimate of reserves needed to cover specifically identified lease losses and certain unidentified but inherent risks in the portfolio 
deferred income taxes and income tax reserves deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the time income or expense items are recognized for financial statement purposes and for tax reporting 
such amounts are calculated using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the determination of current and deferred income taxes is based on complex analyses of many factors including interpretation of federal and state income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities temporary differences  estimates of amounts due or owed such as the timing of reversals of temporary differences and current financial accounting standards 
the company has open tax years that may in the future be subject to examination by federal and state taxing authorities  management periodically evaluates the adequacy of related tax reserves  taking into account our open tax return positions  tax assessments received and tax law changes 
the process of evaluating tax reserves involves the use of estimates and a high degree of management judgment 
actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities and reserves 
the company s estimates are reviewed continuously to ensure reasonableness 
however  the amounts the company may ultimately realize could differ from such estimated amounts 
overview of results and trends net earnings for the year ended june  were up from the prior year due to higher income from a larger investment in leases  along with better than expected results from the portfolio of assets reaching the end of term and a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a

california first national bancorp and subsidiaries during fiscal  the company began to benefit from a rising interest rate environment  with the average yield on leases held in its own portfolio increasing by about basis points 
in addition  yields on cash and other interest earning investments improved by basis points 
however  part of these gains were off set by the growth in deposits at the bank and an increase in average interest rates paid of basis points

net direct finance and interest income net direct finance and interest income is the difference between interest earned on the investment in capital leases  securities and other interest earning investments and interest paid on deposits or other borrowings 
net direct finance and interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and liabilities  the movement of interest rates  and funding and pricing strategies 
net direct finance and interest income was million for the fiscal year ended june  compared to million for fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to an increase of million in direct finance income and  in interest income on cash and investments  offset by a million increase in interest expense on deposits 
the increase in direct finance income reflects an increase in the average investment in capital leases directly held by the company  and a basis point improvement in average yields on such investment 
the increase in interest income on cash and investments resulted from the increases in interest rates earned offset by a decrease in the average balances 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an increase of  in direct finance income and a  increase in interest income earned on cash and investments  offset by a  increase in interest expense on deposits 
the increase in direct finance income reflected an increase in the average investment in capital leases directly held by the company  offset by a decrease in yields on such investment

california first national bancorp and subsidiaries provision for lease losses the company s provision for lease losses in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal and  in the increase in the provision in fiscal from fiscal relates to the growth in the net investment in capital leases 
while the lease portfolio has grown over the period  the level of problem leases has declined and no material losses have been incurred 
the increase in the provision in from fiscal primarily relates to the growth in the net investment in capital leases during that year  including a higher percent of special mention leases  which offset the benefit from a decline in non performing assets 
other income other income is a significant source of income for the company  accounting for of the company s gross profit during the year ended june   during and during total other income of million for the year ended june  increased million  or  from million in but was relatively unchanged from million in the increase in other income in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects an increase of million in gain on sale of leases and leased property as the volume of leased property sold on leases coming to end of term increased during the period 
operating and sales type lease income increased by  reflecting only a slight increase in lease extensions when compared to the prior year 
the decrease in other income during fiscal from fiscal includes a decline in operating and sales type income of  or  as the volume of leases renewed during the year declined 
the gain on sale of leases and leased property decreased by  or  as the volume of lease property sold on leases coming to end of term also decreased during the period 
fiscal included the recognition of a million gain on sale of leased property related to a lease in bankruptcy 
while the sale proceeds were received during fiscal  the recognition of the gain was deferred until certain bankruptcy issues were resolved 
without this gain  other income would have been lower 
selling  general  and administrative expenses the company s selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased  or  to million recognized for the year ended june  this compared to sg a expenses in fiscal of million  which had increased by  or  from million in fiscal the decrease in sg a expenses during fiscal is due to lower costs resulting from a slightly smaller sales force and lower variable costs resulting from efforts to control costs 
sg a expenses in fiscal also reflect a lower deferral of initial direct costs of million  compared to million in fiscal the increase in sg a expenses during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to higher administrative costs required to manage the growth in the portfolio as well as the development of the organization 
sg a expenses in fiscal reflect a deferral of initial direct costs of million  compared to million in fiscal income taxes income taxes were accrued at a tax rate of for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for fiscal year ended june   and for fiscal year ended june  representing the company s estimated annual tax rates for each respective year 
the income tax rate increased in fiscal due in part to a decreased volume of leases where interest earned is exempt from certain taxes 
tax exempt leases represented approximately of new lease bookings in fiscal  compared to during fiscal and in fiscal financial condition analysis lease portfolio analysis the company currently funds a high percentage of new lease transactions internally  while only a small portion of leases are assigned to financial institutions 
during the fiscal year ended june   approximately of the total dollar amount of new leases booked by the company were held in its own portfolio  compared to during fiscal and during fiscal during the fiscal year ended june   the company s net investment in capital leases increased by million 
this increase includes a million increase in the company s investment in lease receivables  and a million reduction in the investment in estimated residual values 
the increase in the investment in capital leases is primarily due to the higher volume of new lease transactions booked and retained by the company while the decline in investment in residual values is due to a higher volume of residual values being recognized at end of term than being booked on new leases on which the company retains a residual investment 
california first national bancorp and subsidiaries the company often makes payments to purchase leased property prior to the commencement of the lease 
the disbursements for these lease transactions in process are generally made to facilitate the lessees property implementation schedule 
the lessee generally is contractually obligated by the lease to make rental payments directly to the company during the period that the transaction is in process  and obligated to reimburse the company for all disbursements under certain circumstances 
income is not recognized while a transaction is in process and prior to the commencement of the lease 
at june   the company s investment in property acquired for transactions in process was million  up from million at june   and million at june  the company s risk assets are comprised almost exclusively of leases for capital assets to businesses and other commercial or non profit organizations 
all leases are secured by the underlying property being leased 
the company s strategy is to develop lease portfolios with risk reward profiles that meet its objectives 
through the use of non recourse financing  the company avoids risks that do not meet these requirements 
the strategy emphasizes diversification on both a geographic and customer level  and spreading the company s risk across a breadth of leases while minimizing the risk to any one customer 
at june   no lessee accounted for more than of the company s net investment in capital leases  and two lessees combined represented approximately of the company s net investment in capital leases 
the investment in capital leases is diversified by geographic regions  with the company s portfolio spread across all fifty states 
at june   california was the only state that represented more than of the company s net investment in capital leases 
the company has no exposure to foreign lessees 
the company s leases are with lessees in a wide spectrum of industries  however  at june  approximately of the company s net investment in capital leases was with public and private colleges  universities  elementary and secondary schools located throughout the united states 
the educational portfolio includes over leases with over different lessees 
one university represented approximately of the company s net investment in capital leases 
the company believes the exposure to this sector is warranted based on the historically good credit profile of this group 
the company monitors the performance of all leases held in its own portfolio  transactions in process  as well as lease transactions assigned to lenders  if the company retains a residual investment in the leased property subject to those leases 
an ongoing review of all leases ten or more days delinquent is conducted 
lessees who are delinquent with the company or an assignee are coded in the company s accounting and tracking systems in order to provide management visibility  periodic reporting  and appropriate reserves 
the accrual of interest income on leases will be discontinued when the lessee becomes ninety days or more past due on its lease payments with the company  unless the company believes the investment is otherwise recoverable 
leases may be placed on non accrual earlier if the company has significant doubt about the ability of the lessee to meet its lease obligations  as evidenced by consistent delinquency  deterioration in the lessee s financial condition or other relevant factors 
the following table summarizes the company s non performing capital leases 
june  non performing capital leases in thousands non accrual leases restructured leases leases past due days other than above total non performing capital leases non performing assets as of net investment in capital leases before allowances california first national bancorp and subsidiaries non performing assets increased during fiscal due primarily to an increase in restructured leases  most of which related to lessees impacted by hurricane katrina and where the company revised the terms of the leases to accommodate the circumstances 
direct finance income that would have been recorded had non performing leases at each respective fiscal year end been current in accordance with their original terms would have been   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
the amount of direct finance income actually recorded on non performing capital leases was   and  during fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition to the non performing capital leases identified above  there were million of investment in capital leases at june  for which management has concerns regarding the ability of the lessees to continue to meet existing lease obligations  compared with million at june  this amount consists of leases classified as substandard or doubtful  or with lessees that currently are experiencing financial difficulties or that management believes may experience financial difficulties in the future 
although these leases have been identified as potential problem leases  they may never become non performing 
these potential problem leases are considered in the determination of the allowance for lease losses 
the decrease in amount at june  reflects the improvement in the credit of several special mention credits from the prior year  which offset the addition of other substandard leases 
allowance for lease losses the allowance for lease losses provides coverage for probable and estimatable losses in the company s lease portfolios 
the allowance recorded is based on a quarterly review of all leases outstanding and transactions in process 
lease receivables or residuals are charged off when they are deemed completely uncollectible 
the determination of the appropriate amount of any provision is based on management s judgment at that time and takes into consideration all known relevant internal and external factors that may affect the lease portfolio 
years ended june  dollars in thousands property acquired for transactions in process before allowance net investment in capital leases before allowance net investment in risk assets allowance for lease losses at beginning of year charge off of lease receivables recovery of amounts previously written off provision for lease losses allowance for lease losses at end of year allowance for lease losses as percent of net investment in capital leases before allowances allowance for lease losses as percent of net investment in risk assets the allowance for lease losses increased slightly to million of net investment in capital leases at june  from million of net investment in capital leases at june  the allowance at june  consisted of  allocated to specific accounts that were considered impaired and million that was available to cover losses inherent in the portfolio 
this compared to million allocated to specific impaired accounts at june  and million that was available to cover losses inherent in the portfolio at such date 
the allowance allocated to specific accounts decreased  while the unallocated allowance increased  during fiscal the increase in the unallocated allowance primarily relates to the growth in the net investment in capital leases  including a higher amount of special mention leases 
at june   the volume of transactions in process was up from the end of the prior year  however the volume of unfunded lease commitments remained relatively unchanged 
based on the above factors  the company considers the allowance for doubtful accounts of million at june  adequate to cover losses specifically identified as well as inherent in the lease portfolios 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will not  in any particular period  sustain lease losses that are sizeable in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the lease portfolio  in light of factors then prevailing  including economic conditions and the on going credit review process  will not require significant increases in the allowance for lease losses 
among other factors  a continued economic slowdown may have an adverse impact on the adequacy of the allowance for lease losses by increasing credit risk and the risk of potential loss even further 
as the company has retained a significantly greater percentage of leases in its own portfolio  this creates increased exposure to delinquencies  repossessions  foreclosures and losses than the company has historically experienced 
california first national bancorp and subsidiaries liquidity and capital resources the company funds its operating activities through internally generated funds  bank deposits  non recourse debt  and as necessary  through access to credit facilities

the assigned lease payments are discounted at fixed rates such that the lease payments are sufficient to fully amortize the aggregate outstanding debt 
at june   the company had outstanding non recourse debt aggregating million relating to property under capital leases 
in the past  the company has been able to obtain adequate non recourse funding commitments  and the company believes it will be able to do so in the future 
the leasing companies also have access to a million line of credit with a bank lender 
the purpose of the line is to provide resources as needed for investment in transactions in process and capital leases 
the agreement provides for borrowings based on the lender s prime rate or libor  at the leasing companies option  requires a commitment fee on the unused line balance and allows for advances through march  the agreement is unsecured  however  the leasing companies obligations are guaranteed by the company 
under the provisions of the agreement  the leasing companies must maintain a minimum net worth and profitability 
in addition  the leasing companies and the company are required to provide financial statements and a certificate to the lender within days of the end of a fiscal quarter  which covenants were not satisfied for the fiscal quarter ended march  as a result of the restatement noted above 
on august  the lender provided the company and the leasing companies with a waiver of all breached covenants 
no borrowings have been made on this line of credit as of september  california first national bancorp and subsidiaries contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes various contractual obligations to make and receive future payments at june  commitments to purchase property for unfunded leases are binding and generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses 
since the company expects some of the commitments to expire without being funded  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent the company s future liquidity requirements 
due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years dollars in thousands time deposits less than  time deposits  or more deposits without a stated maturity operating lease rental expense lease property purchases total contractual commitments contractual cash receipts lease payments receivable cash and cash equivalents total projected cash availability net projected cash inflow disbursements to purchase property on approved leases are estimated to be completed within one year  but it is likely that some portion could be deferred to fiscal based upon contractual cash flows  amounts could differ due to prepayments  lease restructures  charge offs and other factors 
the need for cash for operating activities will increase as the company expands 
the company believes that existing cash balances  cash flow from operations  cash flows from its financing and investing activities  and assignments on a non recourse basis of lease payments will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable financing needs 
inflation has not had a significant impact upon the operations of the company

california first national bancorp and subsidiaries item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from changes in market indices such as interest rates and equity prices 
the company s principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk  which is the exposure due to differences in the repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the company s balance sheet structure is primarily short term in nature  with a greater portion of assets that reprice or mature within one year 
as a result  the company s exposure to interest rate risk largely results from declines in interest rates and the impact on net direct finance and interest income 
at june   the company had million invested in securities of very short duration  including million in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell 
the company s gross investment in lease payments receivable of million consists of leases with fixed rates  however  million of such investment is due within one year of june  this compares to the bank s interest bearing deposit liabilities of million  of which mature within one year 
the leasing companies have no interest bearing debt  and non recourse debt does not represent an interest rate risk to the company because it is fully amortized through direct payments from lessees to the purchaser of the lease receivable 
based on the foregoing  at june   the company had assets of million subject to changes in interest rates over the next twelve months  compared to repricing liabilities of million 
given the current structure of the consolidated balance sheet  if interest rates decrease  interest income on the company s short term investment position decreases  and future lease rates from direct financing leases  which often are based on united states treasury rates  will tend to be lower 
conversely  as interest rates rise  the company s earnings will benefit as yields on cash investments and lease investments improve  with less offsetting impact from rising interest expense 
as the banking operations of the company have grown and the bank s deposits represent a greater portion of the company s assets  the company is subject to increased interest rate risk 
the bank has an asset liability management committee and policies established to manage its interest rate risk 
the bank measures its asset liability position through duration measures and sensitivity analysis  and calculates the potential effect on earnings using maturity gap analysis 
the interest rate sensitivity modeling includes the creation of prospective twelve month baseline and rate shocked net interest income simulations 
after a baseline net interest income is determined  using assumptions that the bank deems reasonable  market interest rates are raised or lowered by to basis points instantaneously  parallel across the entire yield curve  and a rate shocked simulation is run 
interest rate sensitivity is then measured as the difference between calculated baseline and rate shocked net interest income 
the results of this analysis on the bank currently are not material to the company as a whole
