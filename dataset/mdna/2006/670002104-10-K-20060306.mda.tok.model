overview during  novavax successfully transitioned from a specialty pharmaceutical company  which included the sales and marketing of products serving the women s health space  to an innovative  biopharmaceutical company leveraging our proprietary technologies in vaccines  adjuvants  and drug delivery 
we are now focused on creating differentiated  value added pharmaceutical and vaccine products and licensing them at various stages of development to realize their value 
our drug delivery technologies include our micellar nanoparticle mnp technology  which is the basis for the development of our first fda approved product  estrasorb 
in addition to mnp  our drug delivery technologies include novasomes paucillamellar non phospholipid liposomes and sterisomes 
our vaccine technologies include functional virus like particle vlp manufacturing utilizing the baculovirus expression system in insect cells as well as novel vaccine adjuvants based on novasomes and dendrimer technologies 
currently  our main focus is to develop a vaccine against a potential avian influenza pandemic  using our vlp vaccine technology 
vlps are genetically engineered particles that imitate the important three dimensional structures of viruses but are composed of recombinant proteins and therefore are believed incapable of causing infection and disease 
our proprietary production technology employs insect cells rather than eggs 
we can more rapidly produce a safe  effective low cost vaccine as compared with the labor intensive egg based process 
key advantages of the technology are the ability to rapidly respond to emerging threats of new strains and a reduced risk of allergic reaction 
a proof of concept study  conducted in collaboration with the nih and cdc  demonstrated that a recombinant vlp vaccine against the hn strain of avian influenza reduced disease morbidity in mice against a live challenge of the hn virus when compared with unvaccinated animals 
this study is the basis for the development of vlp vaccines against the hn strain of avian and human seasonal influenza 
in addition  the company is studying the applicability of its proprietary adjuvants in conjunction with the vlp vaccines to improve immunogenicity of the vaccine 
other projects in development using our proprietary vlp technology include vaccines for hiv  sars and seasonal influenza 
we are also developing e selectin tolerogen for the prevention of secondary strokes 
we will also continue to leverage our drug delivery technologies by developing and licensing new products based on our mnp technology 
estrasorb  our first internally developed product using mnp technology  is the first topical emulsion for estrogen therapy approved by the fda for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms hot flashes associated with menopause 
estrasorb was licensed in october to esprit pharma  inc  for marketing in north america see significant transactions below

included in sales and marketing expenses is million related to these two restructurings 
cancellation of king pharmaceuticals agreements in january  we entered into a co promotion agreement with king pharmaceuticals  inc for our topical estrogen therapy  estrasorb  in the united states and puerto rico the territory 
we also entered into a license agreement with king for many countries outside the united states 
the co promotion and license agreements the agreements granted king the right to share equally in the revenues and expenses for manufacturing and marketing estrasorb in the territory and exclusive rights to many countries outside the united states 
the agreements also entitled us to up to million in milestone payments from king for achievement of milestones outlined in the agreements 
in june  we amended the agreements the amended agreements 
the amended agreements clarified the terms of two milestone payments totaling million 
the amended agreements also granted king exclusive rights to promote  market and distribute estrasorb in canada  switzerland  greece  italy  spain and the netherlands  the only countries excluded from the original license agreement

included in the assets and liabilities written off were deferred financing costs of million relating to the convertible notes held by king  and remaining deferred revenue of million relating to previous licensing fees for estrasorb  mentioned above 
critical accounting policies and changes to accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results could differ  and actual results that do differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
for further discussion of our accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herewith 
revenue recognition and allowances we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

for our product sales  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize these sales net of allowances for returns  rebates and chargebacks 
a large part of our product sales is to distributors and to esprit who resell the products to their customers 
we provide rebates to members of certain buying groups who purchase from our distributors  to distributors that sell to their customers at prices determined under a contract between us and the customer  and to state agencies that administer various programs such as the federal medicaid and medicare programs 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases or by reference to a specific price for a product 
we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and record the liability as a reduction of revenue when we record our sale of the products 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from three to months after sale 
we regularly analyze the historical rebate trends and make adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs in a similar manner  we estimate amounts for returns based on historical trends  distributor inventory levels  product prescription data and generic competition and make adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and competition 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement with pharmelle  llc see significant transactions we no longer have responsibility for rebates or returns related to avc cream and suppositories  novanatal and novastart as of the date of the sale of such assets 
under the supply agreement with esprit pharma  inc see significant transactions we no longer have responsibility for rebates related to estrasorb  days subsequent to entering into the supply agreement and we no longer have responsibility for returns related to estrasorb sales made subsequent to the entering into the supply agreement 
a non recurring reserve of million for anticipated returns of vitamins negatively impacted by generic competition was netted against product sales for we based this reserve on estimated current wholesaler inventory levels compared to projected demand until product expiration 
the shipping and handling costs we incur are included in cost of products sold in the accompanying statements of operations 
for up front payments and licensing fees related to our contract research or technology  we follow the provisions of sab no 
in determining if these payments and fees represent the culmination of a separate earnings process or if they should be deferred and recognized as revenue as earned over the life of the related agreement 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon achievement of contract specified events and when there are no remaining performance obligations 
for  and  revenues earned under current biological technologies research contracts were recognized per the terms and conditions of such contracts for invoicing of costs incurred and defined milestones 
in  revenue earned under a drug development contract was recognized on the percentage of completion method whereby revenue was recognized in proportion to the estimated cost to complete the contract 
in  revenue earned under the renewal of the igi agreement see significant transactions was recognized upon receipt of payment 
also in  revenue earned under the esprit transaction see significant transactions was recognized at the time of the agreement since we had no further performance obligations related to the license 
research and development costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we will continue to incur research and development costs as we expand our product development activities utilizing our proprietary drug delivery and biological technologies 
our research and development costs have included  and will continue to include  expenses for internal development personnel  supplies and facilities  clinical trials  regulatory compliance and reviews  validation of processes and start up costs to establish commercial manufacturing capabilities 
at the time our new product candidates are approved by the fda and we begin commercial manufacturing  we will allocate costs at our manufacturing location to inventory and cost of products sold 
in  we began allocating our costs to manufacture estrasorb to inventory and cost of sales 
as a result  our research and development costs decreased and our inventory and cost of sales increased 
depreciation and amortization depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment is provided under the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  generally three to years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is provided over the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the term of the lease  whichever is shorter 
we completed the build out and validation of our manufacturing facility in philadelphia in in addition  we purchased  validated and installed equipment for estrasrob manufacturing in the total investment in for the facility and equipment was approximately million 
we began recognizing amortization or depreciation on these assets in total amortization and depreciation expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million respectively 
accounting for facility exit costs in july  we entered into a long term agreement to lease a  square foot facility in malvern  pennsylvania for the consolidation and expansion of our corporate headquarters and product development activities 
the lease  with a commencement date of september   has an initial term of years with two five year renewal options 
standard annual escalation rental rates are in effect during the initial lease term 
with six months advance notice  we also have an option to lease adjoining space of  square feet  which could be built out for future manufacturing needs 
we applied the principles of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  in accounting for contract termination costs and associated costs that will continue to be incurred under the operating lease expiring on october  relating to our former corporate offices located in columbia  maryland 
we recorded a liability of  in and  in for the difference between the fair value of the remaining lease payments  reduced by current estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained and included the corresponding expense in facility exit costs 
as of december  the remaining liabilities were  we applied the principles of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and apb no 
 accounting changes  in writing off the remaining useful lives of the leasehold assets relating to the columbia facility 
for the year ended december    was included in facility exit costs associated with the moving of corporate offices 
goodwill and intangibles assets goodwill originally results from business acquisitions  in particular  the million of goodwill we recognized for our acquisition of fielding pharmaceuticals in december assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values  the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
intangible assets other than goodwill are the result of product acquisitions  non compete arrangements  and internally discovered patents 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  ranging from five to years 
we periodically evaluate the periods of amortization to determine whether later events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
as a result of the license and supply agreements with esprit pharma  inc and the asset purchase agreement with pharmelle  llc see significant transactions we wrote off net intangible assets totaling million in in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under these rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to impairment tests annually or more frequently should indicators of impairment arise 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives beginning in the first quarter of the company utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis  which includes profitability information  estimated future operating results  trends and other information in assessing whether the value of indefinite lived intangible assets can be recovered 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 the company tested its goodwill for impairment as of january  and determined that no impairment was present 
during   and  the company performed the required annual impairment test on the carrying amount of its goodwill  which indicated the company s estimated fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying value  therefore  no impairment was identified at december   or if the appraisal had determined that the goodwill was impaired  the write down would have increased our net loss by a comparable amount 
stock options and stock based compensation we apply the principles of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for stock options issued to our employees 
apb no 
generally does not require that options granted to employees be expensed 
had we applied the fair value principles of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  our net loss for the years ended december   and would have increased to approximately million  million and million  respectively  as compared to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the financial accounting standards board eliminated the alternative use of apb no 
s intrinsic value method of accounting starting with the first fiscal year that begins after june  we will be required to record the effect of applying this revision as of january  during the year ended december  we granted  restricted shares of common stock totaling million in value at the date of grant to various employees  officers and a board member  which vest over periods of up to three years 
in accordance with apb no 
 for the year ended december   million was included in non cash stock compensation expense related to this restricted stock 
during  we granted stock options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock to two consultants as compensation for services in we included  of non cash stock compensation expense in sales and marketing expense  which represents the fair value as of the grant date 
guaranty in april  we executed a conditional guaranty of a brokerage margin account for a director  in the amount of  prior to demanding payment from the company  the brokerage firm must first make demand for payment to the director and then liquidate the account 
thereafter  if there remains a shortfall  they may demand payment from the company 
as of december  and  the company has not recorded any liability on its balance sheet related to this guarantee as we believe the possibility of required payment by the company to be unlikely 
in august  we approved the issuance of  shares of common stock in a private placement to this director for  among other things  his agreement to pledge such shares to the brokerage firm to secure the guarantee mentioned above 
results of operations for fiscal years  and in thousands  except percentage changes and share and per share information revenues change from change from revenues vitamins gynodiol avc line estrasorb other net product sales contract research royalties  milestone and licensing fees revenues for consisted of product sales of million  compared to million in  contract revenues of million  compared to million in  and milestone and licensing fees of million in  compared to million in total revenues for were million  as compared to million for  a million or decrease 
of the total decrease in revenues  product sales accounted for million partially offset by a million increase in royalties  milestone and licensing fees 
the reason for the net decrease in net product sales is primarily due to in september  we entered into the pharmelle transaction for the sale of assets related to avc cream and suppositories  novanatal and novastart products 
as a result the vitamin and avc product sales only reflect a partial year of revenues for these products 
during  the vitamin lines continued to be negatively impacted by generic and new product competition 
gynodiol sales were lower than in primarily due to an out of stock situation for certain prescription strengths 
in october  we entered into the esprit transaction 
under these agreements esprit obtained exclusive rights to market estrasorb in north america and we will continue to manufacture and sell estrasorb to esprit for a lower price than what we previously sold estrasorb to our distributors 
estrasorb net product sales includes sales to our distributors through the date of this agreement and to esprit after this date 
contract research revenues in of million were comparable to contract research revenues of million 
royalties  milestone and licensing fees increased by million from million in to million in primarily due to a million license renewal fee received from igi  inc for a ten year renewal on licensed technologies in specific fields 
revenues for the fiscal year ended december  were million compared to million in this represents a year to year decrease of million  or 
of the million total revenue decrease from to  a decline in product sales accounted for million of that shortage 
the product sales decrease was attributable to an overall decline in sales of our prenatal vitamin lines  gynodiol and avc cream  as well as increased returns for these products from our wholesalers 
in addition a non recurring reserve of million was taken in for anticipated returns of vitamins negatively impacted by generic competition 
contract research revenue increased million from million in to million in primarily due to million we received from an nih grant to develop a second generation aids vaccine  as well as  million we received from an nih contract that was cancelled in july this increase in contract research revenues was partially offset by the completion of several contracts in royalties  milestone and licensing fees decreased million from million in to million in operating costs and expenses operating costs and change from change from expenses cost of products sold excess inventory costs over market research and development selling marketing general and administrative facility exit costs gain on sales of product assets gain on redemption of debt cost of products sold cost of products sold  which includes fixed idle capacity costs at our manufacturing facility  increased to million in  compared to million in a increase 
of the million cost of products sold for  million was due to idle plant capacity costs at our manufacturing facility compared to million in the remaining million increase was primarily due to estrasorb  which accounted for of net product sales in  as opposed to of net product sales in  and carries a much higher cost of product sold than our other products 
estrasorb cost of product sold percentages have been and will continue to be high until we increase production volumes for both estrasorb and other manufactured products to offset the fixed costs and depreciation related to the manufacturing facility  on going facility costs and costs associated with the personnel required to manufacture products at this facility 
with the sale of vitamin and avc lines  future cost of products sold will correspond to our estrasorb sales to esprit  gynodiol sales to distributors and manufacturing costs related to other products produced at our manufacturing facility 
until this facility reaches maximum capacity fixed idle capacity costs will continue to be included in cost of products sold 
cost of products sold was million in  which includes fixed idle capacity costs at our manufacturing facility of million  compared to cost of products sold of million  despite the decrease in product sales of million 
the million increase was primarily due to the launch and sale of estrasorb in the second quarter of as well as the idle plant costs at our manufacturing facility of million 
estrasorb accounted for of net product sales and carries a much higher cost of sales than our other products 
a high volume of returns for our products  other than estrasorb  in has also negatively affected our margins 
excess inventory costs over market as part of the esprit transaction see significant transactions we agreed to sell estrasorb at a price that was lower than our current inventory carrying value and was below our manufacturing costs for the inventory manufactured and sold during the fourth quarter of this resulted in a write down of million at december  we anticipate these costs to be lower in as our manufacturing facility will be more fully utilized manufacturing estrasorb as well as fulfilling other manufacturing contracts 
research and development expenses research and development costs decreased from million in to million in the decrease of million or was due to manufacturing start up costs in being accounted for in the research and development category until april the first quarter of manufacturing costs totaling million were incurred to prepare and validate the estrasorb facility for good manufacturing practices and fda compliance and not to build inventory 
beginning in april  manufacturing costs have been included in cost of sales and inventory 
vaccine contract research costs  which are included in total research and development expenses  decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due to higher costs related to a government contract in  as well as a reduction in facility costs for research and development expenses were million in  compared to million for the decrease of million  or  was primarily due to manufacturing start up costs in being accounted for in the research and development category for all of and only until april this was partially offset by million increase in of research costs related to new product development and other unallocated costs 
reconciliation of significant research and development projects the following table reconciles the direct and indirect costs incurred to date for our major projects to our total research and development expense 
project estrasorb androsorb vaccine contracts and research allocated project costs new drug development and other unallocated costs total estimated cost and time to complete major projects the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   our proprietary product and vaccine candidates were in early stages of development 
due to the inherent nature of product development  future market demand for products and factors outside of our control  such as clinical results and regulatory approvals  we are unable to estimate the completion dates and the estimated total costs for those product candidates 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical trial protocol  including  but not limited to  the following number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  duration of the patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  number of clinical sites included in the trials  and length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
in addition  we test our potential products and vaccines in numerous preclinical studies to identify  among other things  the daily dosage amounts 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results for our trials we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or indications 
we further believe that it is not possible to predict the length of regulatory approval time 
factors that are outside our control could significantly delay the approval and marketability of our product candidates 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above and other risks and uncertainties  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to numerous variations 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue pursuing our business strategy 
for more discussion of the risks and uncertainties and our liquidity  see item a risk factors and see liquidity and capital resources 
selling expenses selling expenses were million in compared to million in the decrease of million  or  was due to the reduction on the sales force in march and the elimination of the remaining sales force in august this corresponded with our strategy of transitioning from a commercial business model to that of one focused on our core competency of new product development 
with the sale of our vitamin and avc lines to pharmelle and licensing estrasorb in north america to esprit  the only remaining product that we are selling directly to our distributors is gynodiol 
gynodiol s selling expenses going forward will be minimal 
selling expenses were million in compared to million in the increase of million  or  was primarily due to the hiring of of king s sales personnel in conjunction with the termination of our co promotion agreements with king in july marketing expenses marketing expenses were million in compared to million in the decrease of million or  was due to the major marketing investment in for the initial launch of estrasorb as well as our strategy of transitioning from a commercial business model to that of one focused on our core competency of new product development 
with the sale of our vitamin and avc lines to pharmelle and the licensing of estrasorb in north america to esprit  our ongoing marketing expenses will be minimal 
marketing expenses were million in compared to million in the increase of million was due to the product launch advertising and promotion for estrasorb  as well as increases in marketing personnel 
general and administrative general and administrative costs were million in compared to million in the million decrease  or is partially due to receiving million from the commonwealth of pennsylvania for the reimbursement of certain costs incurred with the move to our corporate headquarters and product development activities to malvern  pennsylvania as well as cost saving measures implemented in and this decrease was partially offset by increases in legal fees and business development costs  related to strategic initiatives 
general and administrative costs were million in compared to million in the million increase  or  is primarily due to increases in accounting and consulting fees related to the implementation of internal control evaluation and reporting procedures as required by the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as other increases in legal  insurance and facility expenses 
other a charge for facility exit costs of million was recorded in as previously described  in september we moved to malvern  pennsylvania for the consolidation and expansion of corporate headquarters and product development activities 
we vacated our facility in columbia  maryland and recorded a liability of million for contract termination costs and wrote off the net value of the columbia leasehold assets of million 
a further adjustment was made in of million to the contract termination costs 
the gain on the sales of product assets of million recorded in includes a million gain from the esprit transaction and million gain from the pharmelle transaction see significant transactions 
the one time gain on the redemption of debt of million we recorded in relates to the king transaction 
interest income expense change from change from interest income expense interest income interest expense net interest expense was million in  million in  and million in our interest expense relates primarily to the promissory notes with king of million in through july  at which time those notes were redeemed and we issued new convertible notes totaling million to a group of institutional investors 
in october  certain holders of million face amount of the convertible notes exercised their optional conversion rights to convert their notes plus accrued interest into  shares of novavax common stock 
this reduced the aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes outstanding to million 
included in interest expense for is a million write off of deferred financing costs that corresponds to the million convertible debt 
also included in interest expense for and is million and million  respectively  of amortization of deferred financing costs that corresponds to the convertible debt 
net losses change from change from net loss net loss per share weighted shares outstanding net loss for was million or per share  as compared to million or per share for  a decrease of million  or per share 
the decreased loss was due to the gain on sales of product assets of million  a decrease of million in operating expenses and million in facility exit costs  partially offset by the decrease in revenues of million  the gain on redemption of debts of million and an increase of million in interest expense  all previously discussed 
net loss for was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share for an increase of million or per share 
the increased loss was due to the gain on redemption of debt of million  offset by a decrease in revenue of million  million for facility exit costs and an increase in other operating expenses of million  all previously discussed 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to the commitments and progress of our research and development programs  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and manufacturing costs related to estrasorb 
we plan to have multiple products and vaccines in various stages of product development and we believe our research and development as well as general administrative expenses and capital requirements will continue to exceed our revenues 
future activities  particularly product development  are subject to our ability to raise funds through debt or equity financing  or collaborative arrangements with industry partners 
year ended december  in thousands summary of cash flows net cash used provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents beginning cash and cash equivalents ending cash and cash equivalents in addition to revenues of million from through december   we have financed our operations primarily from net proceeds in millions total sales of common stock in public offerings sales of product assets issuance of convertible notes uses associated with the king transaction sales of common stock in a private placement exercise of stock options and warrants cash and cash equivalents were million at december   an increase of million from the december  balance of million
