item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our plan of operation should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide investors with an understanding of our past performance  financial condition  and prospects 
the following will be discussed and analyzed overview of business industry and operating trends components of our operating results results of operations comparison of results between years outlook for liquidity and capital resources subsequent events critical accounting policies and estimates recent accounting pronouncements overview we are an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations in the rocky mountain region of the us we generate revenues by the production of oil and gas from properties which we own independently or with other parties 
currently we have interests in two different plays we own a interest in a drilling program in the piceance basin in western colorado on  gross acres  net to the company and a separate acreage play of over  acres in the eastern dj basin in nebraska 
prior to july  our primary focus was oil and gas exploration  development and production in the russian federation and former commonwealth of independent states cis see note to the financial statements 
since january  our focus has been on acquiring and developing assets in north america  with a particular emphasis on the rocky mountain region in the united states 
at december   our piceance program had three wells on production 
there was no production at december   in respect of the acreage in the dj basin 
financial highlights for the year ended december  include the following the company sold  mcf of natural gas from its piceance basin properties at an average wellhead price of 
actual price realization after fuel  gathering  marketing  and transportation averaged per mcf  resulting in revenues net to the company of  the company s net loss from continuing operations decreased to  in 
per share from  in 
per share 
the following summarizes the company s operational highlights during on february  the company acquired a interest in piceance llc which owns  acres in the piceance basin for a total purchase price  including the fair value of stock and warrants issued of approximately million 
during the second quarter of the company acquired an interest in over  acres in the eastern dj basin for a total investment  including the fair value of stock and warrants issued of approximately million 
piceance llc drilled and completed three wells in and drilled to total depth an additional seven wells  which seven wells are planned to be on production in the first half of effective december  the company entered into an acreage earning agreement  which allows noble energy  inc to earn a interest in our eastern dj basin acreage for million and a carry on wells to be drilled and completed by march  the company entered into a definitive agreement in december and closed on january  further evaluation and restructuring of its cost structure resulting in the elimination of its moscow office and the consolidation of the functions of its steamboat springs  colorado offices into its corporate headquarters in denver  colorado 
during  the company concentrated on developing opportunities in the rocky mountain region of the united states 
it concentrated on close in exploration and or extension development projects involving resource plays in basins deemed to be prolific 
to that end  during the company participated in the drilling and completion of wells in the piceance basin and further participated in the drilling of an additional seven wells to total depth 
the company began its exploration program on over  acres in the eastern dj basin and entered into an acreage earning agreement with noble 
results of operations compared to the company had a net loss from continuing operations for of  compared to a net loss of  for the same period in factors contributing to the smaller net loss for the year included the following oil and gas production net to the company s interest in was  mcf resulting in  in oil and gas sales  at an average wellhead price of per mcf for the year 
the company s price net of fuel  gathering  transportation and marketing fees totaling  or per mcf 
the company s net production began in july oil and gas production net to the company in was  bbls 
revenues between and are not comparable  as effective july  the company sold its russian oil production 
lease operating expenses for the year were  and production taxes were  or of revenues net to the company resulting in operating income from oil and gas activities from piceance llc of  before depreciation and depletion  exploration costs  general and administrative expenses and other income 
lease operating expenses include  incurred directly by teton for consultants working directly on the piceance basin properties 
during  general and administrative expense decreased from  during to  for general and administrative expenses include the non cash expense of  recorded in conjunction with the issuance of common stock to certain individuals affiliated with the company 
factors contributing to the decrease in administrative expense in included reduced due diligence costs associated with the pursuit of acquisitions including acquisitions that failed to close  elimination of the company s moscow  steamboat springs  and houston offices  reduction in investor relations related expenses  and reduction of corporate personnel associated with its overseas operations 
significant changes in general and administrative expenses  exclusive of the  non cash charge relating to the issuance of stock for the year ended december  compared to include advertising and public relations and related consulting expenses decreased  in primarily due to the fact that the company eliminated several consulting contracts in the second quarter of and expensed the costs to terminate such contracts during such quarter 
the company expensed  in due diligence costs in compared to  in related to acquisitions that were not completed 
the company s public company compliance expense and related legal and accounting expenses decreased  in significant costs were incurred in related to the sale of goloil  legal and accounting expense incurred on acquisitions that did not close and costs to prepare the proxy to solicit votes for the sale of goloil 
components of company s compliance and legal costs incurred in include costs incurred in respect to the establishment of the shareholders rights plan  the long term incentive plan  the preparation of three registration statements  and legal costs associated with the departure of a former officer and director of the company 
franchise taxes  included in general and administrative expenses decreased  in travel and entertainment expenses decreased  in relative to as the company no longer incurs the significant costs of traveling to russia 
compensation paid to employees decreased  in relative to because the company has reduced its number of employees from to  partially offset by an increase in severance paid to employees of  primarily related to the severance costs recorded for a former officer and director of the company 
exploration expenses for relate to delay rentals and geological and geophysical expenses incurred by the company primarily on the eastern dj basin leases that were acquired in april 
results of operations compared to the company had a net loss from continuing operations for the year ending december  of  compared to a loss of  for the prior year  an increase of  the increase from to was primarily due to the increase in general and administrative expenses from  for the year ending december  to  for the year ending december  this was due to several reasons including the company unsuccessfully pursued several acquisitions which resulted in the expensing of the various due diligence costs incurred on such acquisitions of  the company increased its payroll during the early part of as it increased its staffing levels to begin its investment and acquisition program  incurring expense of  based on a performance review of management for  the board paid out bonuses to senior management in the first quarter of of  the company began compensating outside directors in cash and stock payments of  the company incurred significant legal  investor relations  accounting and other expenses in selling its interest in goloil and in preparation of the related proxy statement in order to obtain shareholder approval of such sale of  the company incurred severance and other one time costs associated with the reduction of staff  offices and other commitments of  the company incurred additional costs of  associated with the maintenance and ultimate closing of its moscow office in discontinued operations compared to see note to financial statements for a summary of the income loss from discontinued operations 
the company considered the sale of goloil to be effective july  accordingly  the operating activities of goloil for the six months ended june  were included in the company s statement of operations as a net loss from discontinued operations 
goloil s operating revenues and expenses for six months of were less than because teton had recorded a full year of operations for goloil sold its production in at an average price of per barrel compared to the price for oil sold in however  production was sold exclusively to the domestic and near abroad markets and not the export market which during yielded prices substantially above the price received in the domestic and near abroad markets 
prior to september   goloil had sold its oil for a blended oil price which included sales to the export market 
the  gain included the  proceeds from the sale of goloil stock  net of  in expenses plus the elimination of approximately million in net liabilities reflecting the company s pro rata share of goloil as of june  the company s net loss from continuing operations decreased from  in to a net loss of  in this was primarily due to the fact that general and administrative expenses decreased from  in to  in  primarily due to a decrease of  in fees paid to consultants for capital raising activities offset by increases in compensation to officers and employees  professional fees  travel and entertainment  and expenses related to marketing  advertising  and investor relations 
financing charges recorded decreased from  in to  in in  the company recorded a  non cash financing charge as a result of warrants issued with debentures and in the money conversion features present at issuance 
the company opened a representative office in moscow in december to manage its russian operations  as well as to establish a higher profile in the russian oil industry and facilitate greater deal flow as it pursued acquisition opportunities in russia and in other fsu states 
the moscow office was closed in december as a result of the company s decision to exit russia and the company incurred closing costs which were included in continuing operations at december  outlook for the following summarizes the goals and objectives for the company for continue to sustain the piceance basin drilling program 
negotiate and finalize a senior debt facility 
execute the eastern dj exploration and drilling program with noble 
build up the operating capabilities of the company 
pursue additional asset and project opportunities 
liquidity and capital resources the company had a cash balance of  at december  and a working capital surplus of  the company currently estimates the cost of its development and exploration programs to be million for the year ending december  our capital budget could be substantially increased if berry  as operator for the piceance play  increases the drilling program 
the company is undertaking to put in place a senior debt facility during the company expects that its current cash balances  combined with operating cash flow  amounts available from a senior debt facility assuming such facility is in fact established  proceeds from the exercise of warrants and the proceeds from the acreage earning agreement of the eastern dj basin will provide it with adequate resources to meet its capital needs for the company may require additional financing during if the company identifies other acquisitions that meet its investment criteria 
such additional financing may be debt or equity or a combination of both 
see sources and uses of funds below 
sources and uses of funds historically  teton s primary source of liquidity has been cash provided by equity offerings 
equity offerings are expected to continue to play an important role in financing teton s business for the foreseeable future 
in addition  the company is working to establish a borrowing facility with one or more commercial banks  most likely in the form of a revolving line of credit that will be used primarily for the acquisition of producing properties and for developmental drilling and other capital expenditures 
we also expect that revenue will play an increasing role in in its sources of funds owing to increased production from its current and anticipated future wells 
cash flows and capital expenditures during the year ended december  the company expended  in its operating activities primarily to finance its efforts in respect of potential acquisitions and in respect of personnel costs 
this amount compares to  used in operating activities in during  the company used  in its investing activities related to the completion of its acquisition of the membership interest in piceance  llc  the commencement of drilling and completion operations in the piceance and on acquiring the dj basin acreage 
during   warrants were exercised  purchasing common shares of the company for net proceeds to the company of  commitments the company has entered into a three year lease for office space which expires in july future contractual commitments under such lease are  for   for and  for income taxes  net operating losses and tax credits at december  the company has a net operating loss carry forward for us income tax purposes of  approximately million of such net operating loss is subject to us internal revenue code section limitations 
utilization of this portion of the nol is limited to approximately  per annum 
the company has established a valuation allowance for deferred taxes that reduces its net deferred tax assets as management currently believes that these losses will not be utilized in the near term 
the allowance recorded was million and million for and  respectively 
subsequent events subsequent to december  the members of piceance llc applied to the fee owner of the land on which piceance llc s oil and gas rights and leases are located to transfer the interests directly to each of the members 
such transfer occurred on february  subsequent to december  the company closed on an acreage earning agreement with noble energy  inc and received million in cash 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations were based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements 
in response to sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  the company has identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of the financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
the company analyzes our estimates  including those related to oil and gas reserves  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes  derivatives and contingencies  and bases those estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
successful efforts method of accounting the company accounts for natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for gas and oil leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit of production amortization rate 
a gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of producing properties 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine that proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver gas and oil in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
delineation seismic incurred to select development locations within an oil and gas field is typically considered a development cost and capitalized  but often these seismic programs extend beyond the reserve area considered proved and management must estimate the portion of the seismic costs to expense 
the evaluation of gas and oil leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding a gas and oil field that will be the focus of future development drilling activity 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed 
seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred 
reserve estimates estimates of gas and oil reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas and oil that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas and oil reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future gas and oil prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover gas costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of gas and oil attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of gas and oil properties and or the rate of depletion of the gas and oil properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
impairment of gas and oil properties the company reviews oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
the company estimates the expected future cash flows of the developed proved properties and compares such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the proved properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an adjustment will be made to the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
given the complexities associated with gas and oil reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the gas and oil markets  events may arise that would require the company to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with gas and oil properties 
we did not record an impairment during the years ended december   or stock based compensation the company adopted a long term incentive plan in under which the company will issue performance share units convertible into common shares of the company subject to vesting on the basis of the achievement of specified performance targets 
quarterly  the company will compare actual results to the performance targets which are on an annual basis and accrue its best estimate of the fair value of shares to be issued  at the end of the plan year  as compensation expense 
recently issued accounting standards and pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
statement 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the implementation of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
exchanges of non monetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 
this statement amended apb opinion no 
to eliminate the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a non monetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange 
the company believes the impact of this new standard will not have a material impact upon the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas is effective for all reporting periods beginning after june  in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r replaced sfas no 
and superseded apb sfas no 
r will require compensation cost related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in financial statements 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company elected to follow the guidance of apb  which allowed companies to use the intrinsic value method of accounting to value their share based payment transactions with employees 
based on this method  the company did not recognize compensation expense in its financial statements as the stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
sfas no 
r requires measurement of the cost of share based payment transactions to employees at the fair value of the award on the grant date and recognition of expense over the requisite service or vesting period 
sfas no 
r requires implementation using a modified version of prospective application  under which compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards and all new awards will be recognized on or after the date of adoption 
sfas no 
r also allows companies to adopt sfas no 
r by restating previously issued financial statements  basing the amounts on the expense previously calculated and reported in their pro forma footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
the provisions of sfas no 
r will be adopted by the company effective january   using the modified prospective application method 
the effect of the adoption of sfas no 
r is expected to be significant to future financial statements as a result of applying the current fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
the amount of unvested stock compensation as of december  is  which will be recorded in future periods as earned 
in february  the staff of the securities and exchange commission sent a letter to oil and gas registrants regarding situations that require additional financial statement disclosures  pending final resolution of accounting treatment 
the following are items related to registrants using the successful efforts method of accounting companies may enter concurrent commodity buy sale arrangements  or transactions in contemplation of other transactions  often to assure that the commodity is available at a specific location 
pending resolution of accounting questions with the emerging issues task force  the commission staff has requested additional disclosures for any such material arrangements  including separate disclosure on the face of the income statement of any related proceeds and costs reported on a gross basis 
these disclosures are not applicable  since the company has not entered any transactions of this nature 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  specifies that drilling costs for completed exploratory wells should be expensed if the related reserves cannot be classified as proved within one year unless certain criteria are met 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position  accounting for suspended well costs 
fsp provides guidance for evaluating whether sufficient progress is being made to determine whether reserves can be classified as proved 
fsp is effective for all reporting periods beginning after april   however  early application is permitted 
pending adoption of fsp  the commission staff has requested additional disclosures be included in registrants financial statements regarding their accounting policy for capitalization of exploratory drilling costs  as well as disclosure of capitalized exploratory drilling cost amounts included in the financial statements 
at december   the company had  in exploratory wells which had been drilled to total depth 
these wells will be completed in the first half of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates and commodity prices 
as of august   when the company sold its interest in goloil  the company is no longer exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
currently  the company is not involved in any hedge contracts  although we may consider hedge agreements in the future to manage the exposure to commodity price risk
