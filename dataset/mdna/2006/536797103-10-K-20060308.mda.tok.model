item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with item business  item a 
risk factors and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview our acquisition model is focused on acquiring average performing new vehicle franchised stores and then integrating and improving them 
our goal is to maximize the operations of all four departments of every store we acquire 
we have had success with this strategy since our initial public offering in late while our strategy has not changed over the last nine years  our ability to integrate and improve the stores that we acquire has increased dramatically 
we have also developed a better process for identifying acquisition targets that fit our operating model 
our cash position  substantial lines of credit  plus an experienced and well trained staff are all available to facilitate our continued growth as the opportunities develop 
in keeping with this model  we acquired a total of eight stores and twenty four additional franchises from january  through march  with total estimated annual revenues of nearly million 
historically  new vehicle sales have accounted for over half of our total revenues but less than one third of total gross profit 
we use a volume based strategy for new vehicle sales called promo pricing  that complements the goal of most auto manufacturers  which have continued to offer a high level of cash or other incentives to automotive customers 
for  we expect that manufacturers will continue to offer incentives on new vehicle sales through a combination of repricing strategies  rebates  early lease cancellation programs and low interest rate loans to consumers 
in  we will be introducing a new initiative under which all sales personnel will have interactive personal computers  which will allow the salesperson to quickly and efficiently enter data and interact with the customer to speed up the sales process 
vehicle and customer information will immediately be downloaded onto the appropriate forms necessary to complete the sales process  eliminating  over time  the need for paperwork to be done by hand 
the goal of this initiative is to create a simplified and more efficient process for both the salesperson and the customer  speeding up the sales process and improving the customer s experience 
this initiative will be used for both new and used vehicle sales 
since the beginning of  the used vehicle market has been negatively impacted by strong competition from the new vehicle market  which has benefited from heavy manufacturer incentives in the form of cash rebates  discounted pricing and low interest financing 
in the first quarter of  the used vehicle market showed positive signs as a result of constrained industry supply  which led to improvements in retail pricing and margins 
in the second and third quarters of  we experienced an increase in trade ins of quality used vehicles in connection with the domestic manufacturers employee pricing programs 
we received these trade ins at good valuations and  in the fourth quarter of  we had a strong used vehicle cycle as we sold much of what we brought into inventory in the previous quarters 
we have implemented new procedures in the used vehicle business  which have also demonstrated positive results for our used vehicle business we conduct our own local used vehicle auctions in select markets and manage the disposal of used vehicles at larger auctions 
the process is centralized and controlled at the management level 
we utilize a used vehicle promo pricing strategy  which markets vehicles with a down payment and then groups vehicles by payment level 
vehicles are marked with clear and understandable pricing  which reduces haggling and speeds up the sale process 
this strategy clearly addresses the three biggest issues of price  down payment and monthly payment for our customers and our sales personnel 
in addition  as a complement to our ongoing used vehicle operation at each store  we use specialists in our support services group to increase the acquisition of used vehicles 
we believe that this will help bolster sales volumes in the to year old vehicle market

the increase in same store sales was driven by same store sales increases across all business lines 
the employee pricing programs offered by the domestic manufacturers during the second and third quarters of  as well as a mix shift away from trucks and suvs  resulted in a decrease in average selling prices which led to increases in new units sold  the combination of which resulted in higher same store new vehicle sales 
the same programs also contributed to improvements in same store used vehicle sales due to the large number of good quality used vehicle trade ins associated with the high volume of new vehicle purchases 
the increase in compared to was primarily a result of acquisitions  as well as increases in the average new and used vehicle sales prices in compared to the increase was offset in part by a same store sales decline of 
our new vehicle same store sales were down in compared to because of a slower sales environment in our markets and a difficult comparison from the prior year  which experienced a increase 
used vehicle same store sales were negatively affected in compared to due to continued manufacturer incentives on new vehicles which led to continued weakness in the used vehicle market 
same store sales percentage increases decreases were as follows compared to compared to new vehicle retail  excluding fleet used vehicle  including wholesale total vehicle sales  excluding fleet finance and insurance service  body and parts total sales  excluding fleet same store sales are calculated by dealership comparing only those months that contain full month operating data 
penetration rates for certain products were as follows finance and insurance service contracts lifetime oil change and filter the decrease in the finance and insurance penetration rate in compared to was due to reduced availability of manufacturer subsidized low interest rate loans during the second and third quarters of when the manufacturers offered their employee pricing programs 
the improvements in same store service  body and parts revenue in both compared to and in compared to were a result of our continued focus on service advisor training and our lifetime oil program 
in addition  pricing and cost saving initiatives across the service  body and parts business lines contributed to the improvement in compared to fleet and other sales include both fleet sales and fees received for delivering vehicles on behalf of the manufacturer  the us military  rent a car companies or leasing companies 
gross profit gross profit increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to due primarily to increased total revenues  as well as increases in our overall gross profit margin 
gross profit margins achieved were as follows year ended december  lithia margin change new vehicle bp retail used vehicle wholesale used vehicles finance and insurance service  body and parts overall year ended december  lithia margin change new vehicle bp retail used vehicle wholesale used vehicles finance and insurance service  body and parts overall bp stands for basis points one hundred basis points equals one percent 
in the new vehicle business  margins remained constant in compared to and improved in compared to as a result of strategic initiatives and internal directives in and early that increased gross profit per vehicle sold 
these margin raising initiatives were partially offset in by manufacturers employee pricing programs  which created a higher volume  lower margin environment during the second and third quarters of this compares to a higher volume  lower margin strategy that was in place in retail used vehicle margins improved in compared to as a result of a stronger pricing and retail environment for used vehicles in combination with a large quantity of good quality used vehicle trade ins in recent quarters 
in  we were able to improve the margins on our used vehicle sales compared to primarily because of the strategies discussed earlier regarding the auctioning of undesired used vehicles and our used vehicle promo pricing for our retail sales 
margins in our wholesale used vehicle business declined in compared to  as a result of aggressive wholesaling in the third and fourth quarters of designed to clear inventories going into the seasonally slower winter months 
gross profits per unit remained positive 
we continue to hold our own local used vehicle auctions and manage the disposal of our units at larger auctions  which has contributed to improvements in gross profit per vehicle  partially offsetting the declines due to the aggressive wholesaling 
the service  body and parts business has benefited from our focus on service advisor training  which has led to gains in the sale of higher margin service items in compared to and in compared to in addition  we also instituted a number of pricing and cost saving initiatives across the entire service  body and parts business 
higher penetration rates for our lifetime oil change and filter service have also contributed to our gross profit margin increase in the increase in the overall gross profit margin in compared to was also affected by the increase in our high margin service and parts revenue as a percentage of total revenue 
the increase in same store revenues in compared to and the improved gross profit margins in compared to  as well as in compared to  led to increases in total same store gross profit of and  respectively  in compared to and in compared to selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense sg a includes salaries and related personnel expenses  facility lease expense  advertising net of manufacturer cooperative advertising credits  legal  accounting  professional services and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to sg a as a percentage of revenue improved by basis points in compared to and decreased by basis points in compared to the increases in dollars spent in compared to and in compared to were due to increased selling  or variable  expenses related to the increases in acquisition revenues and the number of locations 
in addition  the increase also related to increased costs for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of more importantly  however  sg a as a percentage of gross profit is an industry standard and a better gauge for measuring performance relative to sg a expense 
sg a as a percentage of gross profit improved by basis points and basis points  respectively  in compared to and in compared to as we continue to realize the positive results of multiple cost saving initiatives at our corporate headquarters and in the stores 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million and million  respectively  in compared to and in compared to due to the addition of property and equipment primarily related to our acquisitions  as well as leasehold improvements to existing facilities 
income from operations operating margins in improved by basis points to compared to in and by basis points in from in the increases were primarily because of improved overall gross profit margins as discussed above 
in addition  in  operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved by basis points compared to in compared to  however  the improvement in gross profit margins was partially offset by a basis point increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
floorplan interest expense floorplan interest expense increased million in compared to increases in the average interest rates on our floorplan facilities resulted in increases to floorplan interest expense of million 
in addition  our average outstanding balance on these facilities increased million  which contributed million to the overall increase 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease related to our interest rate swaps 
the million increase in floorplan interest expense in compared to resulted primarily from a million increase in the average outstanding balances of our floorplan facilities  mainly due to acquisitions  and an increase of  resulting from our interest rate swaps 
in addition  an increase in the average interest rates charged on our floorplan facilities increased floorplan interest expense by  other interest expense other interest expense includes interest on our convertible notes  debt incurred related to acquisitions  real estate mortgages  our used vehicle line of credit and equipment related notes 
other interest expense increased million in compared to changes in the weighted average interest rate on our debt in compared to increased other interest expense by approximately million and changes in the average outstanding balances resulted in an increase of approximately million 
interest expense related to the million of convertible notes that were issued in may totals approximately  per quarter  which consists of  of contractual interest and  of amortization of debt issuance costs 
other interest expense increased million in compared to changes in the weighted average interest rate on our debt in compared to increased other interest expense by approximately  and changes in the average outstanding balances resulted in an increase of approximately million 
for all debt  including floorplan notes payable  our average interest rate in increased at only about half the pace of market interest rates due to our interest rate hedging strategies 
income tax expense our effective tax rate was in compared to in and in our effective tax rate may be affected in the future by the mix of asset acquisitions compared to corporate acquisitions  as well as by the mix of states where our stores are located 
the increase in our effective tax rate in compared to was due primarily to an increase in revenue in some of our higher tax rate states 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue increased in compared to as a result of improvements in gross profit margins and operating expenses as discussed above 
income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue increased in compared to as a result of improvements in gross profit margins that were partially offset by increased operating expenses and interest expense as discussed above 
discontinued operations we continually monitor the performance of each of our dealerships and make determinations to sell based primarily on return on capital criteria 
once a determination to dispose of a dealership is made  the results of operations are reclassified into discontinued operations 
all dealerships included in discontinued operations have been  or will be  eliminated from our on going operations upon completion of the sale 
during  we sold a building we had held for sale at december   sold one dealership and classified two additional dealerships as discontinued operations  which are held for sale at december  during  we disposed of the franchises included with a dealership we had held for sale at december  during  we sold one of our dealerships classified as discontinued operations 
we expect that the dealerships held for sale at december  will be sold during certain financial information related to discontinued operations was as follows in thousands year ended december  revenue pre tax income loss gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax amount of goodwill and other intangible assets disposed of interest expense is allocated to stores classified as discontinued operations for actual flooring interest expense directly related to the new vehicles in the store 
interest expense related to the used vehicle line of credit is allocated based on total used vehicle inventory of the store  and interest expense related to the equipment line of credit is allocated based on the amount of fixed assets 
assets held for sale included the following in thousands december  inventories property  plant and equipment goodwill other intangible assets liabilities held for sale of million at december  represented new vehicle flooring notes payable related to the two dealerships held for sale

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  our sales have been lower in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season  inclement weather in certain of our markets and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance is expected to be lower during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters of each fiscal year 
we believe that interest rates  levels of consumer debt and consumer confidence  as well as general economic conditions  also contribute to fluctuations in sales and operating results 
acquisitions have also been a contributor to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources our principal needs for capital resources are to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures  as well as for working capital 
we have relied primarily upon internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements and the proceeds from public equity and private debt offerings to finance operations and expansion 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  available lines of credit and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next months from december  our inventories increased to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to acquisitions  as well as a decision to take on additional inventory in december due to attractive incentives from certain of our manufacturer partners 
as a result  our new and used flooring notes payable increased to million at december  from million at december  new vehicles are financed at approximately and used vehicles are financed at approximately of cost 
our days supply of new vehicles increased by approximately days at december  compared to december   primarily due to the purchase of additional inventory in december mentioned above 
we believe this inventory level will provide us with strong inventories at attractive prices going into the seasonally strong spring selling season 
our new vehicle inventories are days above our average historical december balances 
our days supply of used vehicles decreased by approximately days at december  compared to december  used vehicle inventories at december  were days below average levels for december we believe that our inventory of good quality used vehicles  which were brought purchased at favorable prices  will benefit our used vehicle business in assets held for sale of million at december  include primarily inventories  fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets related to two dealerships held for sale and are recorded on our balance sheet at the lower of book value or estimated fair market value  less applicable selling costs 
liabilities held for sale of million at december  represented new vehicle flooring notes payable related to two dealerships held for sale 
goodwill and other intangibles increased million to million at december   compared to million at december  store and franchise acquisitions increased goodwill and other intangibles by million 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in goodwill and other intangibles related to dealership disposals and by million being classified as assets held for sale at december  cash paid for acquisitions  net of cash received  in was million 
our board of directors declared a dividend of per share on our class a and class b common stock for the fourth quarter of and for the first quarter of  which were paid in the first two quarters of and totaled approximately million each 
for the second  third and fourth quarters of  our board of directors declared a per share dividend on our class a and class b common stock that totaled approximately million each 
the dividend related to the second quarter of was paid during the third quarter of and the dividend for the third quarter of was paid in the fourth quarter of the dividend related to the fourth quarter of will be paid in the first quarter of we anticipate recommending to the board of directors the approval of a cash dividend each quarter 
in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our class a common stock 
through december   we have purchased a total of  shares under this program and may continue to do so from time to time in the future as conditions warrant 
however  the recent change in the tax law tends to equalize the benefits of dividends and share repurchases as a means to return capital or earnings to shareholders 
as a result  we believe it is now advantageous to shareholders to have a dividend in place 
with the dividend  we are able to offer an immediate and tangible return to our shareholders without reducing our already limited market float  which occurs when we repurchase shares 
we have a working capital and used vehicle flooring credit facility with daimlerchrysler services north america llc and toyota motor credit corporation  totaling up to million  which expires may  this credit facility is cross collateralized and secured by cash and cash equivalents  new and used vehicles on a subordinated basis to the extent not specifically financed by other lenders  parts inventories  accounts receivable  intangible assets and equipment

pursuant to our million credit agreement with daimlerchrysler services north america llc and toyota motor credit corporation  total dividends and repurchases of our common stock cannot exceed million over the term of the agreement 
to date  over the term of the agreement  we have paid dividends and repurchased stock totaling million 
we expect to be in compliance with the covenants for all of our debt agreements in the foreseeable future 
in the event that we are unable to meet such requirements  and any available cure period has passed  the lender may require an acceleration of payment  increase the interest rate or limit our ability to borrow 
interest rates on all of the above facilities ranged from to at december  amounts outstanding on the lines at december   together with amounts remaining available under such lines were as follows in thousands outstanding at december  remaining availability as of december  new and program vehicle lines working capital and used vehicle line equipment leased vehicle line there are no formal limits on the new and program vehicle lines with certain lenders 
we also have outstanding million of senior subordinated convertible notes due we will also pay contingent interest on the notes during any six month interest period beginning may   in which the trading price of the notes for a specified period of time equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the notes 
the notes are convertible into shares of our class a common stock at a price of per share upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and upon the occurrence of certain events as follows if  prior to may   and during any calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter  if  after may   the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price  if  during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of notes for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the notes  if the notes have been called for redemption  or upon certain specified corporate events 
a declaration and payment of a dividend in excess of per share per quarter will result in an adjustment in the conversion rate for the notes if such cumulative adjustment exceeds of the current conversion rate 
we declared a dividend of per share in july  october and february the affect of such dividends does not yet reach the threshold amount and no adjustment in the conversion rate is currently required 
the notes are redeemable at our option beginning may  at the redemption price of of the principal amount plus any accrued interest 
the holders of the notes can require us to repurchase all or some of the notes on may  and upon certain events constituting a fundamental change or a termination of trading 
a fundamental change is any transaction or event in which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for  or constitutes solely the right to receive  consideration that is not all  or substantially all  common stock that is listed on  or immediately after the transaction or event  will be listed on  a united states national securities exchange 
a termination of trading will have occurred if our common stock is not listed for trading on a national securities exchange or the nasdaq stock market 
our earnings to fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the senior subordinated convertible notes  was for the year ended december  contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  was as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond floorplan notes lines of credit and long term debt interest on scheduled debt payments capital commitments operating leases our capital commitments of million at december  were for the construction of five new facilities  additions to two existing facilities and the remodel of two facilities 
three of the new facilities will be for our toyota dealerships in springfield  oregon  klamath falls  oregon and odessa  texas 
the other two new facilities are for our dodge dealership in sioux falls  south dakota and for our mercedes dealership in spokane  washington 
we have already incurred million for these projects and anticipate incurring the remaining million in we expect to pay for the construction out of existing cash balances until completion of the projects  at which time we anticipate securing long term financing and general borrowings from third party lenders for to of the amounts expended 
in addition  we have recorded a reserve for our estimated contractual obligations related to potential charge backs for vehicle service contracts  lifetime oil change contracts and other various insurance contracts that are terminated early by the customer 
at december   this reserve totaled million 
based on past experience  we estimate that the million will be paid out as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses at the date of the financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments on matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on assumptions made by management 
while we have made our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include service contract and lifetime oil contract income recognition  finance fee income recognition  workers compensation insurance premium accrual  discretionary bonus accrual  assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  and used vehicle inventory valuations 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as our policies for valuation of accounts receivable  expense accruals and other revenue recognition 
however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable 
however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
service contract and lifetime oil change contract income recognition we receive fees from the sale of vehicle service contracts and lifetime oil contracts to customers 
the contracts are sold through an unrelated third party  but we may be charged back for a portion of the fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
we have established a reserve for estimated future charge backs based on an analysis of historical charge backs in conjunction with termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
at december  and  this reserve totaled million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we may also participate in future underwriting profit pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  which would be recognized as income upon receipt 
finance fee income recognition we receive finance fees from various financial institutions when we arrange financing for our customers on a non recourse basis 
we may be charged back for a portion of the financing fee income when the customer pays off their loan prior to the guidelines agreed to by the various financial institutions 
we have established a reserve for potential net charge backs and cancellations based on historical experience  which typically result if the customer pays off their loan during the to days after receiving financing 
at december  and  this reserve totaled  and  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
workers compensation insurance premium accrual insurance premiums are paid for under a three year retrospective cost policy  whereby premium cost depends on experience 
we accrue premiums based on our historical experience rating  although the actual experience can be something greater or less than the anticipated claims experience and  as of december  and  the accrual was million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we expect that the retrospective cost policy  as opposed to a guaranteed cost with a flat premium  will be the most cost efficient over time 
discretionary bonus accrual we make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of our attainment  and the level thereof  of the annual bonus criteria under our discretionary bonus program in order to record bonus expense on a quarterly basis 
we accrue the estimated year end expense on a pro rata basis throughout the year based on bonus attainment expectations 
we use this same methodology for our k matching contribution and our years of service bonus programs 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration the historical seasonality of our business and current trends 
if actual year end results differ materially from our estimates  the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated 
the bonus accrual at the end of any given year is accurate and reflective of actual results attained and amounts to be paid 
intangible assets we review our goodwill and other identifiable non amortizable intangible assets for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value based test using discounted estimated cash flows 
discounted future cash flows are prepared by applying a growth rate to historical revenues 
growth rates are calculated individually for each region with data derived from the us census bureau on population growth and the us department of labor  bureau of labor statistics for historical consumer price index data 
the discount rate applied to the future cash flows is derived from a capital asset pricing model which factors in an equity risk premium and a risk free rate 
the review is conducted more frequently than annually if events or circumstances occur that warrant a review 
our other identifiable intangible assets primarily include the franchise value of the business unit  which is considered to have an indefinite life and not subject to amortization  but rather is included in the fair value based testing 
impairment could occur if the operating business unit does not meet the determined fair value testing 
at such point  an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value 
we have determined that we operate as one business unit 
during and  we concluded that there was no impairment 
at december  and  goodwill and other identifiable non amortizable intangible assets totaled million and million  respectively 
used vehicle inventory used vehicle inventories are stated at cost plus the cost of any equipment added  reconditioning and transportation 
we select a sampling of dealerships throughout the year to perform quarterly testing of book values against market valuations utilizing the kelly blue book and nada guidelines 
used vehicle inventory values are cyclical and could experience impairment when market valuations are significantly below inventory costs 
historically  we have not experienced significant write downs on our used vehicle inventory 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk variable rate debt we use variable rate debt to finance our new and program vehicle inventory and certain real estate holdings 
the interest rates on our variable rate debt are tied to either the one or three month libor or the prime rate 
these debt obligations therefore expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in these rates 
the flooring debt is based on open ended lines of credit tied to each individual store from the various manufacturer finance companies 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense decreases 
our variable rate flooring notes payable  variable rate mortgage notes payable and other credit line borrowings subject us to market risk exposure 
at december   we had million outstanding under such agreements at interest rates ranging from to per annum 
a increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million  net of tax  based on amounts outstanding at december  fixed rate debt the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall because we could refinance for a lower rate 
conversely  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
based on open market trades  we determined that our million of long term convertible fixed interest rate debt had a fair market value of approximately million at december  in addition  at december   we had million of other long term fixed interest rate debt outstanding with maturity dates of between december and may based on discounted cash flows  we have determined that the fair market value of this long term fixed interest rate debt was approximately million at december  hedging strategies we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
accordingly  we have entered into interest rate swaps to manage the variability of our interest rate exposure  thus leveling a portion of our interest expense in a rising or falling rate environment 
we have effectively changed the variable rate cash flow exposure on a portion of our flooring debt to fixed rate cash flows by entering into receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swaps 
under the interest rate swaps  we receive variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments  thereby creating fixed rate flooring debt 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than to manage interest rate exposure 
that is  we do not engage in interest rate speculation using derivative instruments 
as of december   we had outstanding the following interest rate swaps with us bank dealer commercial services effective january  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month effective february  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month effective november  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month effective november  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month effective march  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  effective march  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month 
we earn interest on all of the interest rate swaps at the one month libor rate 
the one month libor rate at december  was per annum 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreements 
these amounts are recorded as deferred gains or losses in our consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the amount of deferred gains and losses at december  were million and  respectively 
the difference between interest earned and the interest obligation results in a monthly settlement which is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the statement of operations as a component of flooring interest expense 
the resulting cash settlement reduces the amount of deferred gains and losses 
because the critical terms of the interest rate swaps and the underlying debt obligations are the same  there was no ineffectiveness recorded in interest expense 
if  in the future  the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination date  or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable rate borrowings would stop  we would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the deferred gains or losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
incremental flooring interest expense recognized  net of tax  related to the reclassification of amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income was million  million and million  respectively  in  and interest savings additional expense  net of tax  on un hedged debt as a result of changing interest rates  based on interest rates effective as of january  was approximately million   and  respectively  in  and interest expense savings  net of tax  on un hedged debt as a result of decreasing interest rates during  based on interest rates effective as of january  was  interest expense  net of tax  on un hedged debt increased during and by approximately million and  respectively  as a result of increasing interest rates during those periods 
as of december   approximately of our total debt outstanding was subject to un hedged variable rates of interest 
at current interest rates  we estimate that we will recognize interest savings  net of tax  of approximately million related to our interest rate swaps during for all debt  including floorplan notes payable  our average interest rate in increased at only about half the pace of market interest rates due to our interest rate hedging strategies 
risk management policies we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow attributable to both our outstanding and forecasted debt obligations as well as our offsetting hedge positions 
the risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques  including cash flow sensitivity analysis  to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows
