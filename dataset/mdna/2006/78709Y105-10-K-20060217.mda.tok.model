scst is a leading transportation company providing regional and interregional ltl and selected national ltl  truckload tl and time definite service solutions to more than  customers across the united states 
our operating subsidiaries are saia motor freight line  inc saia  based in duluth  georgia  and jevic transportation  inc jevic  based in delanco  new jersey 
our business is highly correlated to the industrial economy and is impacted by a number of other external factors including the price and availability of fuel  equipment  real estate and drivers  weather and government regulation 
the key factors that affect our operating results are the volumes of shipments transported through our networks  as measured by our average daily shipments and tonnage  the prices we obtain for our services  as measured by revenue per hundredweight yield and revenue per shipment  our ability to manage our cost structure for capital expenditures and operating expenses such as salaries  wages and benefits  purchased transportation  claims and insurance expense  fuel and maintenance  and our ability to match operating costs to shifting volume levels

year ended december  revenue and volume consolidated revenue increased percent to  million as a result of improved pricing at both operating subsidiaries and increased volumes as both shipments and ltl tonnage were up significantly at saia over the prior year 
volume gains were attributable to improved market share gains into and out of saia s newer midwest markets  favorable economic conditions across saia s network  industry consolidation and company specific initiatives 
fuel surcharge revenue  which was percent of total revenue in  was up significantly from when fuel surcharge revenue was percent of total revenue 
the fuel surcharge program is intended to reduce the 
table of contents company s exposure to rising diesel prices and other costs affected by increased fuel prices  such as purchased transportation 
while fuel costs increased significantly during  higher fuel surcharge revenues have more than offset higher diesel fuel costs 
however  in recent years  given the significance of fuel surcharges  the negotiation of customer price increases have become commingled with fuel surcharges 
as such it now represents more than a pass through of increased fuel costs 
a rapid and significant decline in diesel fuel prices would reduce the company s revenue and yield 
saia had operating revenue of million in  an increase of percent over operating revenue of million 
saia s operating revenue excluding fuel surcharge was million in  up percent from million in saia s ltl revenue per hundredweight a measure of yield increased percent to per hundredweight for and ltl revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge increased percent 
saia experienced stronger price increases in over  largely due to the continuation of a more favorable pricing environment that began in the second half of this pricing environment allowed saia to achieve better contract renewal rates with customers than in the and the first half of however  pricing remains competitive in regional markets

jevic s tonnage was down percent to million tons and shipments were down percent to million shipments 
jevic s year over year tonnage decline was most pronounced in the second and third quarters of management believes the decline in tonnage was in part due to a loss of business resulting from service challenges experienced in the latter third of as well as other competitive and customer specific effects 
in the fourth quarter of  jevic s year over year tonnage comparison improved compared to second and third quarters  which management believes was due in part to capacity constraints in the truckload market that increased jevic s truckload revenue

acquisition and million in charges at jevic to reflect actuarially estimated increases in the workers compensation liability related to claims in prior years 
exclusive of these items  saia showed operating income improvement in excess of million  reflecting higher margin contribution on year over year volume increases and yield improvement partially offset by structural cost increases 
this operating income improvement was offset by a significant margin decline at jevic 
jevic s decreased margin was largely due to the impact of revenue declines  which created diseconomies of scale with regard to fixed costs in their operating model 
the consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by operating revenue was compared to in however  excluding the real estate gain  the consolidated operating ratio was saia continued initiatives to manage productivity and control variable costs as monthly volumes fluctuated 
the impact of higher margin and volume increases at saia were partially offset by structural cost increases in wage rates  purchased transportation  healthcare costs and other operating expenses 
in august  jevic named a new president to lead the evaluation and implementation of a series of initiatives designed to improve operations and profitability with a focus on growing ltl tonnage  improving cost effectiveness and enhancing revenue quality 
higher fuel prices exclusive of taxes  in conjunction with volume changes  caused million of the increase in operating expenses and supplies 
purchased transportation costs increased percent as decreased utilization was more than

increased revenues from the fuel surcharge program more than offset the effect of these fuel price increases 
saia had operating income of million in  which included a million real estate gain  compared to million in which included a million integration charge

in the fourth quarter  the company recorded a partial insurance recovery of million for losses attributable to hurricane katrina 
this amount approximates management s estimate of actual fourth quarter effects of the hurricanes 
the remaining insurance recovery  which management expects to be in excess of this amount  will be recognized upon reaching a negotiated settlement for the remaining claims 
the operating ratio at saia was in compared to in saia s operating ratio was excluding the million real estate gain in compared to in  excluding the million integration charge 
saia improved its operating income through yield improvement  increased volume as well as continued strong cost controls

as of the fourth quarter  saia s wage rates were approximately percent higher than the fourth quarter of jevic operating income was million in  versus million in jevic s results include approximately million charge to workers compensation expense related to an increase in the actuarially estimated liability for claims from prior years 
jevic s volume decline and very modest yield improvement hurt fixed cost coverage and contributed to variable diseconomies that were only partially offset by salary and other general and administrative expense reductions and other operating expense savings 
however  in  jevic s service execution was consistently high  an improvement over service performance 
in august  jevic named a new president to lead the evaluation and implementation of a series of initiatives designed to improve operations and profitability with a focus on growing ltl tonnage  improving cost effectiveness and enhancing revenue quality

the notes to the consolidated financial statements provide an analysis of the income tax provision and the effective tax rate 
working capital capital expenditures the decrease in working capital is predominantly the result of higher accounts payable at december  due to approximately million in trailer purchases delivered late in and higher wage and employee benefit accruals that more than offset an increase in accounts receivable

projected net capital expenditures for are approximately million plus up to an additional million for several strategic real estate opportunities within saia s existing network 
including these capital expenditures for real estate in  this represents an approximately million increase from net capital expenditures for property and equipment 
approximately million of the capital budget was committed at december  net capital expenditures pertain primarily to replacement of revenue equipment at both subsidiaries and additional investments in information technology  land and structures 
projected capital expenditures for could exceed this level if saia is successful in executing on its geographic expansion objective 
the company has historically generated cash flows from operations that have funded its capital expenditure requirements 
cash flows from operations were million for the year ended december   which were million more than net capital expenditures for acquisition of property and equipment 
cash flows from operating activities in increased million primarily as a result of increased profitability and increased accounts payable and wage and benefit accruals 
the timing of capital expenditures can largely be managed around the seasonal working capital requirements of the company 
in addition  during  the company executed million in treasury share repurchases under a million authorized program and reduced outstanding indebtedness by approximately million

in addition to these sources of liquidity  the company has million under its long term debt facilities  which is available to fund other longer term strategic investments 
future operating cash flows are primarily dependent upon the company s profitability and its ability to manage its working capital requirements  primarily accounts receivable  accounts payable and wage and benefit accruals 
the company has the ability to adjust its capital expenditures in the event of a shortfall in anticipated operating cash flows 
the company believes its current capital structure and availability under its borrowing facilities along with anticipated cash flows from future operations will be sufficient to fund planned replacements of revenue equipment and investments in technology 
additional sources of capital may be needed to fund future long term strategic growth initiatives 
actual net capital expenditures are summarized in the following table in millions year ended land and structures additions sales revenue equipment  net technology and other clark bros

in addition to the principal amounts disclosed in the tables below  the company has estimated interest obligations of approximately million for and decreasing for each year thereafter  based on borrowings outstanding at december

amount of commitment expiration by year thereafter total other commercial commitments available line of credit letters of credit surety bonds total commercial commitments critical accounting policies and estimates scst makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements that affect reported amounts and disclosures therein 
in the opinion of management  the accounting policies that generally have the most significant impact on the financial position and results of operations of scst include claims and insurance accruals 
scst has self insured retention limits generally ranging from  to  per claim for medical  workers compensation  auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
for only the policy year march through february  the company has an aggregate exposure limited to an additional  above its  per claim deductible under its auto liability program 
the liabilities associated with the risk retained by scst are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis  demographics  nature and severity  past experience and other assumptions 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred  with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation claims and with respect to all other liabilities  estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience 
however  these estimated accruals could be significantly affected if the actual costs of scst differ from these assumptions 
a significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle 
these estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time  however  assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 
revenue recognition and related allowances 
revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis for shipments in transit while expenses are recognized as incurred 
in addition  estimates included in the recognition of revenue and accounts receivable include estimates of shipments in transit and estimates of future adjustments to revenue and accounts receivable for billing adjustments and collectibility 

table of contents revenue is recognized in a systematic process whereby estimates of shipments in transit are based upon actual shipments picked up  scheduled day of delivery and current trend in average rates charged to customers 
since the cycle for pick up and delivery of shipments is generally days  typically less than percent of a total month s revenue is in transit at the end of any month 
estimates for credit losses and billing adjustments are based upon historical experience of credit losses  adjustments processed and trends of collections 
billing adjustments are primarily made for discounts and billing corrections 
these estimates are continuously evaluated and updated  however  changes in economic conditions  pricing arrangements and other factors can significantly impact these estimates 
depreciation and capitalization of assets 
under the scst accounting policy for property and equipment  management establishes appropriate depreciable lives and salvage values for scst s revenue equipment tractors and trailers based on their estimated useful lives and estimated fair values to be received when the equipment is sold or traded in 
these estimates are routinely evaluated and updated when circumstances warrant 
however  actual depreciation and salvage values could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
recovery of goodwill 
in connection with its acquisition in  scst allocated purchase price based on independent appraisals of intangible assets and real property and management s estimates of valuations of other tangible assets 
annually  scst assesses goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
this fair value based test involves assumptions regarding the long term future performance of the operating subsidiaries of scst  fair value of the assets and liabilities of scst  cost of capital rates and other assumptions 
however  actual recovery of remaining goodwill could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
in the event remaining goodwill is determined to be impaired a charge to earnings would be required 
equity based incentive compensation 
the company maintains long term incentive compensation arrangements in the form of stock options and cash based awards 
the criteria for the cash based awards are scst s total shareholder return versus a peer group of companies over a three year performance period 
the company accrues for cash based award expenses based on performance criteria from the beginning of the performance period through the reporting date 
this results in the potential for significant adjustments from period to period that cannot be predicted 
the company accounts for stock options in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
with option expense amortized over the three year vesting period based on the black scholes merton fair value at the date the options are granted 
these accounting policies  and others  are described in further detail in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to adopt accounting policies and make significant judgments and estimates to develop amounts reflected and disclosed in the financial statements 
in many cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques that could be used 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimates that are required to prepare the financial statements 
however  even under optimal circumstances  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information
