item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation executive overview community financial corporation is a virginia corporation 
certain of the information presented herein relates to community bank  a wholly owned subsidiary of community financial  and community first mortgage corporation  a former wholly owned subsidiary of community bank which was sold in june community financial and community bank  like all thrift institutions and their holding companies  are subject to comprehensive regulation  examination and supervision by the office of thrift supervision and the federal deposit insurance corporation 
the following information is intended to provide investors a better understanding of our financial position and the operating results of community financial corporation and its subsidiary  community bank 
this discussion is primarily from management s perspective and may not contain all information that is of importance to the reader 
accordingly  the information should be considered in the context of the consolidated financial statements and other related information contained herein 
our net income is primarily dependent on the difference or spread between the average yield earned on loans and investments and the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings  as well as the relative amounts of such assets and liabilities 
the interest rate spread is affected by regulatory  economic and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows 
like other financial institutions  we are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits and borrowings with short and medium term maturities  mature or reprice more rapidly  or on a different basis  than interest earning assets  primarily loans with longer term maturities than deposits and borrowings 
while having liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  such an asset liability structure may result in lower net income or net losses during periods of rising interest rates  unless offset by other noninterest income 
our net income is also affected by  among other things  fee income  provision for loan losses  operating expenses and income taxes 
the primary factor contributing to the increase in net interest income for the fiscal year ended march  was the growth in interest earning assets  primarily loans  partially offset by a decreasing interest rate spread resulting from the rising market interest rates 
we will continue to monitor the impact rising interest rates may have on both the growth in interest earning assets and our interest rate spread 
the pace and extent of future interest rate changes will impact our loan growth and interest rate spread  as well as interest rate adjustments on certain adjustable rate loans that are subject to caps 
funding for the growth in interest earning assets combined with a rising interest rate environment has impacted the composition of our interest bearing liabilities 
while borrowings decreased  deposits increased and were the primary source of funding during the fiscal year ended march  we were more aggressive in our time deposit pricing during the fiscal year as we anticipated rate increases by the federal reserve board 
also  as interest rates have increased  deposit balances in savings and money market accounts have decreased as customers have transferred funds to time deposits or equities markets 
management recognizes the need to continue to increase deposits and was successful in attracting time deposits and non interest bearing transactions accounts 
while we have the capacity to continue to utilize borrowings to meet funding needs  management recognizes the practical long term limitations of such a funding strategy 
management is also cognizant of the potential for compression in our net interest margin 
next page related to the need to acquire funds and the pace of interest rate changes 
management will continue to monitor the level of deposits and borrowings in relation to the current interest rate environment 
critical accounting policies general 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the financial information contained within our financial statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standard sfas no  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and ii sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market  and the loan balance 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to absorb future loan losses currently inherent in the loan portfolio 
management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance is based upon type and volume of the loan portfolio  past loan loss experience  existing and anticipated economic conditions  and other factors which deserve current recognition in estimating future loan losses 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
additions to the allowance are charged to operations 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
loans are charged off partially or wholly at the time management determines collectibility is not probable 
management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance is subject to evaluation and adjustment by our regulators 
the allowance consists of specific  general and unallocated components 
the specific component relates to loans that are classified as either doubtful  substandard or special mention 
for such loans that are also classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
an unallocated component is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
the unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan 
next page and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  we do not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment disclosures  unless such loans are the subject of a restructuring agreement 
asset liability management management believes it is important to manage the relationship between interest rates and the effect on our net portfolio value 
this approach calculates the difference between the present value of expected cash flows from assets and the present value of expected cash flows from liabilities  as well as cash flows from off balance sheet contracts 
management of our assets and liabilities is done within the context of the marketplace  but also within limits established by the board of directors on the amount of change in net portfolio value which is acceptable given certain interest rate changes 
presented in the following table  as of march  and  is an analysis of our interest rate risk as measured by changes in net portfolio value for instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in the yield curve and compared to our board policy limits 
information is presented in accordance with office of thrift supervision regulations and based on its assumptions 
the board limits have been established with consideration of the dollar impact of various rate changes and our strong capital position 
as illustrated in the table  net portfolio value is not significantly impacted by rising or falling rates as of the date indicated 
march  march  change in interest rate basis points board limit npv as of assets change in npv change in npv change in npv change in npv dollars in thousands generally  management strives to maintain a neutral position regarding interest rate risk 
in the current interest rate environment  our customers are interested in obtaining long term credit products and short term savings products 
management has taken action to counter this trend 
a significant effort has been made to reduce the duration and average life of our interest earning assets 
as of march   approximately of our gross loan portfolio consisted of loans which reprice during the life of the loan 
we emphasize adjustable rate mortgage loans and have increased our portfolio of short term consumer loans 
longer term fixed rate mortgage loans  to years  are generally sold in the secondary market 
on the deposit side  management has worked to reduce the impact of interest rate changes by emphasizing non interest bearing or low interest deposit products and maintaining competitive pricing on longer term certificates of deposit 
we have also used federal home loan bank advances to provide funding for loan originations and to provide liquidity as needed 

next page in managing our asset liability mix depending on the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions  and consumer preference  we may place somewhat greater emphasis on maximizing our net interest income than on strictly matching the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
we believe the increased net income that may result from an acceptable mismatch in the actual maturity or repricing of our asset and liability portfolio can provide sufficient returns to justify the increased exposure to sudden and unexpected increases in interest rates which may result from such a mismatch 
we have established limits  which may change from time to time  on the level of acceptable interest rate risk 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  our efforts to limit interest rate risk will be successful 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the information in the table above 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
we consider all of these factors in monitoring our exposure to interest rate risk 

next page average balances  interest rates and yields the following table sets forth certain information relating to categories of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
all average balances are computed on a monthly basis

next page financial condition total assets increased million  or  to million at march   primarily as a result of an increase in loans of million 
the increase in assets was funded by a million  or  increase in deposits 
the increase in deposits is reflected primarily in increased demand deposits of million  time deposits of million and money market accounts of million  partially offset by a million decrease in savings accounts 
the change in deposits is related primarily to rising interest rates and customers preference for higher rate time deposits 
management believes the increase in time and demand deposits is primarily attributable to maintaining competitive pricing 
management attributes the increase in loans receivable primarily to excellent customer service and competitive pricing on both mortgage and consumer loans 
the hampton roads region of the bank experienced loan growth of million  primarily real estate loans  for the fiscal year ended the shenandoah valley region of the bank had loan growth of approximately million  primarily non mortgage loans that included a million increase in automobile dealer loans  at march  asset quality is an important factor in the successful operation of a financial institution 
the loss of interest income and principal that may result from non performing assets has an adverse effect on earnings  while the resolution of those assets requires the use of capital and managerial resources 
at march   total non performing assets  consisting of non performing loans and repossessed automobiles  were  or

at march  non performing assets at march  were comprised primarily of single family residential properties delinquent days or more 
at march   the largest property in non performing assets was a residential construction loan with a loan balance of  based on current market values of the collateral securing these loans  management anticipates no significant losses in excess of the reserves for losses previously recorded 
due to an uncertain real estate market and the economy in general  no assurances can be given that our level of non performing assets will not increase in the future 
stockholders equity increased million  or  to million at march  compared to million at march  the increase was the result of million of net income  proceeds from option exercises and an increase in the unrealized gain on equity securities  partially offset by dividends paid to stockholders of  results of operations our results of operations depend primarily on the level of our net interest income and noninterest income and the level of our operating expenses 
net interest income depends upon the value of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
comparison of years ended march  and general 
net income for the year ended march  was million or diluted earnings per share compared to million or diluted earnings per share for the year ended march   an increase of  or 
net income increased due primarily to a decrease in the provision for loan losses of  interest income 
total interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  as compared to million for the year ended march  the increase in total interest income can be attributed to both an increase in the average dollar volume of interest earning assets  primarily million in loans receivable  and an increase in the yield on interest 
next page earning assets 
average yields on total interest earning assets increased basis points from in fiscal to for the current fiscal year due primarily to a higher interest rate environment 
interest expense 
total interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase in total interest expense is attributable to both an increase in the average dollar volume of interest bearing liabilities  primarily million in deposits and an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the cost of funds increased basis points from for the year ended march  to for the current year 
the increase in deposit balances was due primarily to increases in time deposits for the current fiscal year 
provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to earnings  at a level required to reflect probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio 
in evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses  management considers historical loss experience  the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect borrowers ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  peer group data  prevailing economic conditions  and current factors 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as residential real estate  small commercial real estate  home equity and consumer loans  are evaluated in the aggregate using historical loss factors adjusted for current economic conditions and other relevant data 
larger non homogeneous loans  such as commercial loans for which management has concerns about the borrowers ability to repay  are evaluated individually  and specific loss allocations are provided for these loans when necessary 
based on management s evaluation of these factors  provisions provision for loan losses decreased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended march  from  for the fiscal year ended march  the decline in the provision for fiscal was due both to a decrease in the rate of loan growth and a decrease in allowances for certain loan categories based on historical charge off rates 
we monitor our loan loss allowance on a quarterly basis and make allocations as necessary 
management believes that the level of our loan loss allowance is adequate 
as of march   the total allowance for loan losses amounted to million 
at march   our allowance as a percentage of total loans receivable was 
and as a percentage of total non performing loans was noninterest income 
noninterest income increased  or  to million in fiscal as compared to million for the year ended march  the increase in noninterest income was primarily due to fees received from other institutions where we receive fees in return for completed customer mortgage loan applications for the other institution s approval and funding 
fiscal fiscal change loan fee income    deposit fee income    other  total noninterest income  noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march   due primarily to increased compensation expense related to the employment of additional commercial loan officers and loan support staff

management maintains investments in liquid assets based upon its assessment of i our need for funds  ii expected deposit flows  iii the yields available on short term liquid assets  iv the liquidity of our loan portfolio and v the objectives of our asset liability management program 
liquidity represents our ability to meet our on going funding requirements for contractual obligations  the credit needs of customers  withdrawal of customers deposits and operating expenses

unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
in the current interest rate environment  equity  maturity structure and quality of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels
