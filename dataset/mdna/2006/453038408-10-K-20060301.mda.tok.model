item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial results  as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer  are the responsibility of the company s management 
the company s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model involving the extracting  refining and marketing of hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon based products 
the company s business involves the production or purchase  manufacture and sale of physical products  and all commercial activities are directly in support of the underlying physical movement of goods 
with its extensive resource base in canada  financial strength  disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio  the company is well positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new energy supplies 
while commodity prices remain volatile on a short term basis depending upon supply and demand  the company s investment decisions are based on long term outlooks  using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities 
the corporate plan is a fundamental annual management process that is the basis for setting near term operating and capital objectives in addition to providing the longer term economic assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes 
annual plan volumes are based on individual field production profiles that are updated annually 
prices for crude oil  natural gas and refined products used for investment evaluation purposes are based on corporate plan assumptions that are developed annually 
potential investment opportunities are tested over a wide range of economic scenarios to establish the resiliency of each opportunity 
once investments are made  a reappraisal process is completed to ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements are incorporated into future projects 

table of contents business environment and outlook natural resources the company produces crude oil and natural gas for sale into large north american markets 
economic and population growth are expected to remain the primary drivers of energy demand 
the company expects the global economy to grow at an average rate of almost three percent per year through world energy demand should grow by about two percent per year  and oil and gas are expected to consistently account for about percent of world energy supply through over the same period  the canadian economy is expected to grow at an average rate of about two percent per year  and canadian demand for energy at a rate of about one percent per year 
oil and gas are expected to continue to supply two thirds of canadian energy demand 
it is expected that canada will also be a growing supplier of energy to us markets through this period 
oil products are the transportation fuel of choice for the world s fleet of cars  trucks  trains  ships and airplanes 
primarily because of increased demand in developing countries  oil consumption will increase by percent or about million barrels a day by canada s oil sands represent an important additional source of supply 
natural gas is expected to be a major primary energy source globally  capturing about one third of all incremental energy growth and approaching one quarter of global energy supplies 
natural gas production from mature established regions in the united states and canada is not expected to meet increasing demand  strengthening the market opportunities for new gas supply from canada s frontier areas 
crude oil and natural gas prices are determined by global and north american markets and are subject to changing supply and demand conditions 
these can be influenced by a wide range of factors including economic conditions  international political developments and weather 
in the past  crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile  and the company expects that volatility to continue 
the company has a large and diverse portfolio of oil and gas resources in canada  both developed and undeveloped  which helps reduce the risks of dependence on potentially limited supply sources in the upstream 
with the relative maturity of conventional production in the established producing areas of western canada  the company s production is expected to come increasingly from frontier and unconventional sources  particularly oil sands and natural gas from the far north  where the company has large undeveloped resource opportunities 
petroleum products the downstream continues to experience ongoing volatility in industry margins 
refining margins are the difference between what a refinery pays for its raw materials primarily crude oil and the wholesale prices it receives for the range of products produced primarily gasoline  diesel fuel  heating oil  jet fuel and fuel oil 
crude oil and many products are widely traded with published international prices 
prices for those commodities are determined by the marketplace  often an international marketplace  and are affected by many factors  including global and regional supply demand balances  inventory levels  refinery operations  import export balances  transportation logistics  seasonality and weather 
canadian wholesale prices in particular are largely determined by wholesale prices in adjacent us regions 
these prices and factors are continually monitored and provide input to operating decisions about which raw materials to buy  facilities to operate and products to make 
however  there are no reliable indicators of future market factors that accurately predict changes in margins from period to period 
the company s downstream strategies are to provide customers with quality service at the lowest total cost offer  have the lowest net unit costs among our competitors  ensure efficient and effective use of capital and capitalize on integration with the company s other businesses 
the company owns and operates four refineries in canada  with distillation capacity of  barrels a day and lubricant manufacturing capacity of  barrels a day 
the company s fuels marketing business includes retail operations across canada serving customers through about  esso branded service stations  of which about are company owned or leased  and wholesale and industrial operations through a network of primary distribution terminals 
chemicals although the current business environment is favourable  the north american petrochemical industry is cyclical 
the company s strategy for its chemicals business is to reduce costs and maximize value by continuing to increase the integration of its chemicals plants at sarnia and dartmouth with the refineries 
the company also benefits from its integration within exxonmobil s north american chemicals businesses  enabling it to maintain a leadership position in its key market segments 
results of operations net income in was  million or a share the best year on record surpassing the previous record of  million or a share in  million or a share 
strong operational performance in allowed the company to capture opportunities in an environment of higher commodity prices and industry margins 
higher realizations for crude oil  natural gas and cold lake bitumen and stronger refining margins contributed about  million to earnings when compared to also positive to earnings was 
table of contents increased natural gas and cold lake bitumen volumes of about million 
these factors were partly offset by a stronger canadian dollar  lower volumes at syncrude  the natural decline of conventional crude oil volumes and higher planned maintenance impacting refinery operations 
these factors had a combined negative impact of about million on earnings 
operating costs increased and impacted earnings by about million  primarily driven by higher energy costs and higher syncrude maintenance expenses 
in addition  stock related compensation expenses were million higher than a year earlier and costs associated with the head office relocation of about million were incurred in included in net income in was a million gain on sale of assets  mainly from the redwater and north pembina fields

total operating revenues were billion  up percent from beginning in the third quarter of  incentive compensation expenses previously included in the operating segments are now reported in the corporate and other segment 
this change has the effect of isolating in one segment all incentive compensation expenses and improving the transparency of operating events in the operating segments 
this change has no impact on consolidated total expenses  net income or the cash flow profile of the company 
segmented results in previous years have been reclassified for comparative purposes 
natural resources net income from natural resources was a record  million  exceeding the previous record achieved in of  million  million 
improved realizations for crude oil  natural gas and cold lake bitumen of about million  and higher natural gas and cold lake bitumen volumes of about million were the main reasons for the increase 
their positive impact on earnings was partially offset by the unfavourable impact of a higher canadian dollar of about million  lower volumes due to higher maintenance activities at syncrude of about million and the natural decline of conventional crude oil and ngl volumes of about million 
operating costs were also higher than by about million  primarily driven by higher energy costs of about million and higher syncrude maintenance and other expenses of about million 
included in net income in was a million gain on sale of assets  mainly from the redwater and north pembina fields 
included in net income in was a million gain on sale of assets 
resource operating revenues were billion  up from billion in billion 
the main reasons for the increase were higher realizations primarily for crude oil  natural gas and cold lake bitumen and higher natural gas and cold lake bitumen volumes

the annual average price of brent crude oil  the most actively traded north sea crude and a common benchmark of world oil markets  was about us a barrel in  a more than percent increase over the average price of in 
however  the company s canadian dollar realizations for conventional crude oil increased to a lesser extent because of a stronger canadian dollar 
average realizations for conventional crude oil during the year were cdn a barrel  an increase of percent from in 
average prices for canadian heavy crude oil were higher in  but by less than the relative increase in light crude oil prices  as increased supply of heavy crude oil widened the average spread between light and heavy crude 
the price of bow river  a benchmark canadian heavy crude oil  was higher by percent in  much less than the increase in prices for canadian light crude oil 
prices for canadian natural gas in were higher than the previous year

gross bitumen production at the company s wholly owned facilities at cold lake was a record  barrels a day  up from  barrels in  due to the cyclic nature of production at cold lake and increased volumes from the ongoing development drilling program 
production from the syncrude operation  in which the company has a percent interest  was lower during as a result of planned and unplanned maintenance activities 
gross production of upgraded crude oil decreased to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
the company s share of average gross production decreased to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
gross production of conventional oil decreased to  barrels a day from  barrels in  as a result of the natural decline in western canadian reservoirs 
gross production of ngls available for sale averaged  barrels a day in  down from  barrels in  mainly due to the declining content of wizard lake gas production 
gross production of natural gas increased to million cubic feet a day from million in million 
the increased volumes were mainly due to higher production from the nisku  wizard lake and medicine hat fields 
in december  the company sold its wholly owned and operated redwater field as well as interests in the north pembina field  both located in alberta  for net proceeds of million  realizing a gain of million

c production of natural gas includes amounts used for internal consumption with the exception of the amounts reinjected 
operating costs increased by percent in the main factors were higher energy costs and higher syncrude maintenance and other expenses 
effective april   the company and an affiliate of exxon mobil corporation in canada agreed to operate their respective western canada production organizations as one single organization 
under the consolidation  the company will operate all western canada properties 
there are no asset ownership changes 
the consolidation is expected to result in efficiencies from a streamlined organization 

table of contents petroleum products net income from petroleum products was a record million or cents a litre in  improving on the previous record of million or cents a litre in million or cents a litre 
higher earnings in were mainly a result of stronger industry refining margins 
marketing margins in remained at the low levels of planned refinery maintenance activities were higher in the year  when compared to  impacting both refinery operations and expenses and reducing earnings by about million 
higher earnings were also partially offset by a stronger canadian dollar of about million  higher energy costs of about million and costs associated with the head office relocation of about million

b crude oil and feedstocks sent directly to atmospheric distillation units 
one thousand litres is approximately barrels 
margins were stronger in the refining segment of the industry in compared with those in  pushed up by increased demand for refined petroleum products that stemmed from generally stronger global economic conditions and the short term production disruptions along the us gulf coast 
however  the effects of stronger industry margins were reduced partially by a higher canadian dollar 
marketing margins in remained at the low levels of  reflecting the impact of highly competitive markets 
operating performance of the company s four refineries was solid 
despite higher planned maintenance  refinery utilization for was percent  repeating a record performance level that was established in percent 
the company s total sales volumes  including those resulting from reciprocal supply agreements with other companies  were million litres a day  compared with million litres in million 
excluding sales resulting from reciprocal agreements  sales were million litres a day  compared with million litres in million 
operating costs increased by about seven percent in from the previous year  mainly because of higher energy costs and costs associated with the head office relocation 
in  the company divested its western canada fertilizer distribution assets to agrium inc the transaction did not have a material impact on the financial results of the petroleum products segment 

table of contents chemicals net income from chemicals operations was million in  compared with million in million 
improved industry margins were partly offset by weaker industry demand for polyethylene products 
financial statistics millions of dollars net income operating revenues sales volumes thousands of tonnes a day a polymers and basic chemicals intermediate and others total chemicals a volumes a day are calculated by dividing total volumes for the year by the number of days in the year 
one tonne is approximately short tons or long tons 
total operating revenues from chemical operations were  million  compared with  million in  million 
higher prices for polyethylene and intermediate chemicals were the main contributing factors 
the average industry price of polyethylene was  a tonne in  up eight percent from  a tonne in 
sales of chemicals were  tonnes a day  compared with  tonnes a day in  tonnes mainly due to a reduction in lower margin polyethylene resale volumes and weaker industry demand for polyethylene products 
operating costs in the chemicals segment for were about four percent higher than higher energy costs were the main reason for the increase 
corporate and other net income from corporate and other was negative million in  compared with negative million in positive million 
lower net income in was mainly due to higher stock related compensation expenses of about million  largely driven by the increase in the company s share price from a year earlier  partially offset by the absence of a write down of million on a north toronto property previously recorded in liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash millions of dollars cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at end of year although the company issues long term debt from time to time  internally generated funds cover the majority of its financial requirements 
the management of cash that may be temporarily available as surplus to the company s immediate needs is carefully controlled  both to ensure that it is secure and readily available to meet the company s cash requirements as they arise and to optimize returns on cash balances 
cash flows from operating activities are highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices and product margins 
in addition  the company will need to continually find and develop new resources  and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields  in order to maintain or increase production and resulting cash flows in future periods 
projects are in place or underway to increase production capacity 
however  these volume increases are subject to a variety of risks  including project execution  operational outages  reservoir performance and regulatory changes 

table of contents the company s financial strength enables it to make large  long term capital expenditures 
the company s large and diverse portfolio of development opportunities and the complementary nature of its business segments help mitigate the overall risks of the company and associated cash flow 
further  due to its financial strength  debt capacity and diverse portfolio of opportunities  the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the company s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for its operations and fixed commitments 
cash flow from operating activities cash provided by operating activities was  million  versus  million in  million 
the increased cash flow was mainly due to higher net income and the impact of higher commodity prices on working capital partially offset by additional funding contributions to the employee pension plan and the timing of income tax payments 
the million gain on asset sales is a non cash item and represented a reduction from net income in the cash from operating activities category 
the cash received from asset sales is reported in cash from investing activities 
capital and exploration expenditures total capital and exploration expenditures were  million in  up from  million in  million 
the funds were used mainly to invest in syncrude and cold lake to maintain and expand production capacity  upgrade refineries to meet low sulphur diesel requirements  improve operating efficiency and upgrade the network of esso retail outlets 
about million was spent on projects related to reducing the environmental impact of its operations and improving safety  including about million on the million capital project to produce low sulphur diesel 
the following table shows the company s capital and exploration expenditures for natural resources during the five years ending december  millions of dollars exploration production heavy oil total capital and exploration expenditures for the natural resources segment  about percent of the capital and exploration expenditures in was focused on growth opportunities 
the single largest investment during the year was the company s share of the syncrude expansion 
construction on the upgrader expansion portion of the syncrude stage project was about percent complete at the end of with remaining activities principally focused on mechanical completion  testing and commissioning 
completion of the project with production of higher quality synthetic crude oil is scheduled to come on stream by mid continuing cost and labour pressures in the fort mcmurray area have resulted in the total projected cost for the stage project growing from billion  indicated in march  to billion currently 
the remainder of investment was directed to drilling at cold lake and conventional fields in western canada and advancing the mackenzie gas project 
in april  the company  on behalf of the mackenzie gas project co venturers  halted project execution activities due to insufficient progress on areas critical to the project the finalization of benefits and access agreements  the establishment of a clear regulatory process  and appropriate fiscal terms for the project 
sufficient advances were subsequently made in these areas and  in november  the company notified the national energy board of the project proponents readiness to proceed to public hearings on the project 
hearings began in january and are expected to continue through during  initial applications for fieldwork approvals  including land use permits and water licences  were filed with regulatory agencies and boards 
additional permit applications will be filed in in july  regulatory applications for the development of the kearl oil sands project  in which the company holds about a percent interest and would act as operator in a joint venture with exxonmobil canada  were filed with the alberta energy and utilities board and alberta environment 
hearings are expected to begin later in during the third quarter of  the company and its partners completed a second d seismic acquisition program in the orphan basin on canada s east coast 
a contract agreement for a drilling vessel has been signed and exploration drilling in the orphan basin  offshore newfoundland  is expected in mid the company holds a percent interest in the eight deepwater exploration licences in the orphan basin 
planned capital and exploration expenditures in natural resources are expected to be about million in  with over percent of the total focused on growth opportunities 
investments are mainly planned for development drilling at cold lake and conventional oil and gas operations in western canada  facilities improvement at syncrude  and the mackenzie gas project

table of contents recently issued statement of financial accounting standards share based payments in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas r  share based payments 
sfas r requires compensation costs related to share based payment arrangements to employees to be recognized in the income statement over the requisite service period 
the amount of the compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the instruments issued 
in addition  liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period through settlement 
sfas r is effective for the company as of january   for all awards granted or modified after that date and for those awards granted prior to that date that have not vested 
sfas r will not have a material impact on the company s earnings because in  the company adopted a policy of expensing all share based payments that is consistent with the provisions of sfas r and all prior year outstanding stock option awards have vested 
the cumulative compensation expense associated with stock related awards made in  and has been recognized in the consolidated income statement using the nominal vesting period approach 
the full cost of awards given to employees who have retired before the end of the vesting period has been expensed 
the use of a non substantive vesting period approach based on the retirement eligibility age would not be significantly different from the nominal vesting period approach 
the non substantive vesting period approach will be applicable to grants made after the adoption of sfas r on january  accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty at its september meeting  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty 
this issue addresses the question of when it is appropriate to measure purchases and sales of inventory at fair value and record them in cost of sales and revenues and when they should be recorded as exchanges measured at the book value of the item sold 
the eitf concluded that purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another should be combined and recorded as exchanges measured at the book value of the item sold 
the company currently records certain crude oil  natural gas  petroleum product and chemical purchases and sales of inventory entered into contemporaneously with the same counterparty as cost of sales and revenues  measured at fair value as agreed upon by a willing buyer and a willing seller 
these transactions occur under contractual arrangements that establish the agreement terms either jointly  in a single contract  or separately  in individual contracts 
this accounting treatment is consistent with long standing industry practice although the company understands that some companies in the oil and gas industry may be accounting for these transactions as nonmonetary exchanges 
the eitf consensus will result in the company s accounts operating revenues and purchases of crude oil and products on the consolidated statement of income being reduced by associated amounts with no impact on net income 
all operating segments will be impacted by this change  but the largest effects are in the petroleum products segment 
the eitf consensus will become effective for new arrangements entered into  and modifications or renewals of existing agreements  beginning no later than the second quarter of the purchase sale amounts included in revenue for  and are shown in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap and include estimates that reflect management s best judgment 
the company s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its straightforward business model 
the company does not use financing structures for the purpose of altering accounting outcomes or removing debt from the balance sheet 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and the estimates that are made by the company to apply those policies 
it should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements on page f 
table of contents hydrocarbon reserves proved oil  gas and synthetic crude oil reserve quantities are used as the basis of calculating unit of production rates for depreciation and evaluating for impairment 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and deposits under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are based on detailed geological and engineering assessments of in place crude bitumen volume  the mining plan  historical extraction recovery and upgrading yield factors  installed plant operating capacity and operating approval limits 
the estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the company through long standing approval guidelines 
reserve changes are made with a well established  disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professionals assisted by a central reserves group with significant technical experience  culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management and the company s board of directors 
key features of the estimation include rigorous peer reviewed technical evaluations and analysis of well and field performance information  and a requirement that management make a commitment toward the development of the reserves prior to booking 
notably  no employee is compensated based on the levels of proved reserves bookings 
although the company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced  the timing and ultimate recovery can be affected by a number of factors  including completion of development projects  reservoir performance and significant changes in long term oil and gas price levels 
based on the united states securities and exchange commission regulatory guidance  the company has reported and reserves on the basis of december prices and costs year end prices 
the use of year end prices for reserves estimation introduces short term price volatility into the process since annual adjustments are required based on prices occurring on a single day 
the company believes that this approach is inconsistent with the long term nature of the natural resources business where production from individual projects often spans multiple decades 
the use of prices from a single date is not relevant to the investment decisions made by the company  and annual variations in reserves based on such year end prices are not of consequence to how the business is actually managed 
the impact of year end prices on reserves estimation is most clearly shown at cold lake  where proved bitumen and associated natural gas reserves were reduced by about million oil equivalent barrels as a result of using december   prices  which were seasonally low 
prices of cold lake bitumen were strong for most of  however  they began to deteriorate in the middle of the fourth quarter and ended on december   more than percent below the year s average 
prices quickly rebounded from december  and through january returned to levels that have restored the reserves to the proved category  repeating the same reserves rebooking situation as in january revisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or revaluation of already available geologic  reservoir or production data  new geologic  reservoir or production data  or changes to underlying price assumptions used in the determination of reserves 
this category can also include changes associated with the performance of improved recovery projects and significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment facility capacity 
the company uses the successful efforts method to account for its exploration and production activities 
under this method  costs are accumulated on a field by field basis with certain exploratory expenditures and exploratory dry holes being expensed as incurred 
costs of productive wells and development dry holes are capitalized and amortized on the unit of production method for each field 
the company uses this accounting policy instead of the full cost method because it provides a more timely accounting of the success or failure of the company s exploration and production activities 
impact of reserves on depreciation the calculation of unit of production depreciation is a critical accounting estimate that measures the depreciation of natural resources assets 
it is the ratio of actual volumes produced to total proved developed reserves those reserves recoverable through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods applied to the asset cost 
the volumes produced and asset cost are known and  while proved developed reserves have a high probability of recoverability  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
this variability has generally resulted in net upward revisions of proved reserves in existing fields  as more information becomes available through research and production 
revisions have averaged eight million oil equivalent barrels per year over the last five years and have resulted from effective reservoir management and the application of new technology 
while the upward revisions the company has made over the last five years are an indicator of variability  they have had little impact on the unit of production rates of depreciation because they have been small compared to the large proved reserves base 

table of contents impact of reserves and prices on testing for impairment proved oil and gas properties held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of carrying amounts 
in general  impairment analyses are based on proved reserves 
where probable reserves exist  an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation 
an asset would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value 
impairments are measured by the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
the impairment evaluation triggers include a significant decrease in current and projected prices or reserve volumes  an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected and historical and current operating losses 
in general  the company does not view temporarily low oil prices as a triggering event for conducting impairment tests 
the markets for crude oil and natural gas have a history of significant price volatility 
although prices will occasionally drop precipitously  the relative growth decline in supply versus demand will determine industry prices over the long term and these cannot be accurately predicted 
accordingly  any impairment tests that the company performs make use of the company s long term price assumptions for crude oil and natural gas markets  petroleum products and chemicals 
these are the same price assumptions that are used in the company s annual planning and budgeting processes and are also used for capital investment decisions 
any impairment tests that the company performs also make use of annual volumes based on individual field production profiles  which are also updated as part of the annual plan process 
the standardized measure of discounted future cash flows on page is based on the year end price applied for all future years  as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
future prices used for any impairment tests will vary from the one used in the sfas disclosure and could be lower or higher for any given year 
retirement benefits the company s pension plan is managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and meets funding levels as determined by independent third party actuaries 
pension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding  among others  the discount rate for the benefit obligations  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the long term rate of future compensation increases 
all pension assumptions are reviewed annually by senior management 
these assumptions are adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long term changes in market rates and outlook 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets of percent used in compares to actual returns of percent and percent achieved over the last and year periods ending december  if different assumptions are used  the expense and obligations could increase or decrease as a result 
the company s potential exposure to changes in assumptions is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f at the company  differences between actual returns on plan assets versus long term expected returns are not recorded in the year the differences occur  but rather are amortized in pension expense as permitted by gaap  along with other actuarial gains and losses  over the expected remaining service life of employees 
the company uses the fair value of the plan assets at year end to determine the amount of the actual gain or loss that will be amortized and does not use a moving average value of plan assets 
pension expense represented less than one percent of total expenses in asset retirement obligations and other environmental liabilities legal obligations associated with site restoration on the retirement of assets with determinable useful lives are recognized when they are incurred  which is typically at the time the assets are installed 
the obligations are initially measured at fair value and discounted to present value 
over time  the discounted asset retirement obligation amount will be accreted for the change in its present value  with this effect included in operating expense 
as payments to settle the obligations occur on an ongoing basis and will continue over the lives of the operating assets  which can exceed years  the discount rate will be adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long term changes in market rates and outlook 
for  the obligations were discounted at six percent and the accretion expense was million  before tax  which was significantly less than one percent of total expenses in the year 
there would be no material impact on the company s reported financial results if a different discount rate had been used 
asset retirement obligations are not recognized for assets with an indeterminate useful life 
for these and non operating assets  the company accrues provisions for environmental liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 

table of contents asset retirement obligations and other environmental liabilities are based on engineering estimated costs  taking into account the anticipated method and extent of remediation consistent with legal requirements  current technology and the possible use of the location 
since these estimates are specific to the locations involved  there are many individual assumptions underlying the company s total asset retirement obligations and provision for other environmental liabilities 
while these individual assumptions can be subject to change  none of them is individually significant to the company s reported financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of financial  operating and market risks in the course of its business 
some of these risks are within the company s control  while others are not 
for those risks that can be controlled  specific risk management strategies are employed to reduce the likelihood of loss 
although the government of canada  in ratifying the kyoto protocol  agreed to restrictions of greenhouse gas emissions by the period  it has not determined what measures it will impose on companies 
consequently  attempts to assess the impact on the company can only be speculative 
the company will continue to monitor the development of legal requirements in this area 
other risks  such as changes in international commodity prices and currency exchange rates  are beyond the company s control 
the company s size  strong financial position and the complementary nature of its natural resources  petroleum products and chemicals segments help mitigate the company s exposure to changes in these other risks 
the company s potential exposure to these types of risk is summarized in the earnings sensitivity table below 
the company does not use derivative markets to speculate on the future direction of currency or commodity prices and does not sell forward any part of production from any business segment 
the following table shows the estimated annual effect  under current conditions  of certain sensitivities of the company s after tax net income 
millions of dollars after tax six dollars us a barrel change in crude oil prices one dollar and ten cents a thousand cubic feet change in natural gas prices one cent a litre change in sales margins for total petroleum products one cent us a pound change in sales margins for polyethylene one quarter percent decrease increase in short term interest rates nine cents decrease increase in the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar the amount quoted to illustrate the impact of each sensitivity represents a change of about percent in the value of the commodity or rate in question at the end of each sensitivity calculation shows the impact on net income that results from a change in one factor  after tax and royalties and holding all other factors constant 
while these sensitivities are applicable under current conditions  they may not apply proportionately to larger fluctuations 
the sensitivity of net income to changes in the canadian dollar versus the us dollar increased from year end by about million after tax a year for each one cent change 
this is primarily due to the increase in crude oil prices and industry refining margins
