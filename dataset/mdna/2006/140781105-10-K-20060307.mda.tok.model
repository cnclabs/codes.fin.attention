item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview carbo ceramics inc generates revenue primarily through the sale of products and services to the oil and gas industry 
the company conducts its business within two operating segments proppant and fracture and reservoir diagnostics 
the company s principal business  the proppant segment  consists of manufacturing and selling ceramic proppant for use in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells 
through its fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment  the company provides fracture mapping and reservoir diagnostic services  sells fracture simulation software and provides engineering services to oil and gas companies worldwide 
these services and software are provided through the company s wholly owned subsidiary pinnacle technologies  inc the company s products and services help oil and gas producers increase production and recovery rates from their wells  thereby lowering overall reservoir development costs 
as a result  the company s business is dependent to a large extent on the level of drilling activity in the oil and gas industry worldwide 
however  the company has increased its revenues and income over an extended period and across various industry business cycles by increasing its share of the worldwide market for all types of proppant 
while the company s ceramic proppants are more expensive than alternative non ceramic proppants  the company has been able to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of its products to numerous operators of oil and gas wells through increased technical marketing activity 
the company believes its future prospects will benefit from both an expected increase in drilling activity worldwide and the desire of industry participants to improve production results and lower their overall development costs 
in recent years  the company has expanded its operations outside the united states 
international revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
in the company constructed its first manufacturing facility located outside the united states in the city of luoyang  china and completed a second production line in that doubled the capacity of that facility 
in  the company also opened a sales office in moscow  russian federation  and established distribution operations in the country 
in  the company broke ground on a new manufacturing facility in the city of kopeysk  russian federation 
the company believes international operations will continue to represent an important role in its future growth 
revenue growth in recent years has been driven largely by increases in ceramic proppant sales volume  but fracture diagnostic services are becoming a more important part of revenue growth 
because the company s ceramic proppant products compete in part against lower cost alternatives  the company expects more of its future revenue growth to be derived from an increase in sales volume than from an increase in the selling price of its products 
as a result  the company initiated construction of significant new manufacturing capacity in to meet anticipated future demand 
the company began producing product from its new manufacturing facility in toomsboro  georgia in january that plant is designed to have production capacity of million pounds per year when fully operational  adding more capacity to the company s total manufacturing capacity 
the facility is expected to produce between million and million pounds in construction of the manufacturing plant in russia is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of that plant is designed to have initial production capacity of million pounds per year 
the company s gross profit margins for its proppant business are principally impacted by manufacturing costs and the company s production levels as a percentage of its capacity 
while most direct production expenses have been relatively stable or predictable over time  natural gas  which is used in the production process by the company s domestic manufacturing facilities  has varied from approximately to of total monthly direct production expense over the last three years due to the price volatility of this fuel source 
during  market prices of natural gas increased sharply  peaking during the fourth quarter of the year 
while the company had contracted for most of its domestic natural gas requirements through october  beginning in november  the company began paying current market rates for all of its domestic requirements 
as a result  the average price of natural gas delivered to the company s us manufacturing facilities increased during the fourth quarter of compared to the average price during the first three quarters of the year 
in an effort to mitigate volatility in the cost of natural gas purchases and reduce exposure to short term spikes in the price of this commodity  the company resumed purchasing portions of its future natural gas requirements at various times during the year in late despite the efforts to reduce exposure to changes in natural gas prices  it is possible that  given the significant portion of manufacturing costs represented by this fuel  changes in net income may not fully reflect changes in revenue 
management believes the addition of new manufacturing capacity is critical to the company s ability to continue its long term growth in sales volume and revenue for ceramic proppant 
since  the company has more than doubled its production capacity and  by the end of  had substantially completed construction at a second manufacturing plant in toomsboro  georgia 
this facility began production in january and is expected to increase the company s total manufacturing capacity by million pounds per year when fully operational 
in  the new plant is expected to produce between and million pounds of proppant 
while the company has operated near or at full capacity for much of the previous ten years  the addition of significant new capacity in the future could adversely impact gross profit and operating margins if the timing of this new capacity does not match increases in demand for the company s products 
as the company s sales volume has increased  and as the company has expanded in international markets  there has been an increase in activities and expenses related to marketing  distribution  research and development  and finance and administration 
as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses have increased in recent years 
in the future  the company expects to continue to actively pursue new business opportunities by increasing marketing activities  improving and expanding its distribution capabilities  focusing on new product development  and increasing international activities 
the company expects that these activities will generate increased revenue and that selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will not change significantly 
general business conditions the company s proppant business is significantly impacted by the number of natural gas wells drilled in north america  where the majority of wells are hydraulically fractured 
in markets outside north america  sales of the company s products are less dependent on natural gas markets but are influenced by the overall level of drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity 
furthermore  because the decision to use ceramic proppant is based on comparing the cost of ceramic proppant to the future value derived from increased production rates  the company s business is influenced by the current and expected prices of natural gas and oil 
natural gas prices and drilling activity in the north american market have steadily increased over the past three years 
in  activity levels in north america rebounded from a prior year decline and the company established sales volume records in a number of regions including the us rocky mountains  canada and east texas 
in addition  the company experienced significant sales growth in overseas markets due to an increase in drilling and fracturing activity in europe and asia 
throughout  worldwide oil and natural gas prices and related drilling activity levels remained very strong 
as a result  the company experienced record demand for its products worldwide 
in  the average natural gas rig count increased by in the us and in canada compared to  and the company again established new sales volume records in a number of regions in north america 
while overseas drilling activity remained strong in  and the company saw an increase in sales volume in many regions outside of north america  the company lost ground in the russian market compared to due to an increase in the availability of locally produced russian ceramic proppant 
the company is addressing this situation through construction of a manufacturing facility in russia 
the company s fracture and reservoir diagnostics business is also impacted by the level of global drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity 
in this business benefited from both an increase in the level of global activity and increased acceptance and utilization of the fracture mapping services in the barnett shale formation in north central texas and other unconventional natural gas formations 
the company believes that the demand for the services provided by its fracture and reservoir diagnostic business will increase as oil and gas production companies develop increasingly complex  unconventional reservoirs in north america 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer generally upon delivery of products or at the time services are performed 
the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
in addition  the company generates a significant portion of its revenues and corresponding accounts receivable from sales to three major customers  all of which are in the petroleum pressure pumping industry 
as of december   approximately of the balance in accounts receivable was attributable to those three customers 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of sales and periodically evaluates the allowance based on a review of trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are periodically reviewed for collectibility based on customers past credit history and current financial condition  and the allowance is adjusted  if necessary 
if a prolonged economic downturn in the petroleum pressure pumping industry were to occur or  for some other reason  any of the company s primary customers were to experience significant adverse conditions  the company s estimates of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount and the allowance for doubtful accounts could be increased by material amounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
obsolete or unmarketable inventory historically has been insignificant and generally written off when identified 
assessing the ultimate realization of inventories requires judgments about future demand and market conditions  and management believes that current inventories are properly valued at cost 
accordingly  no reserve to write down inventories has been recorded 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes are provided for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires the company to make certain estimates about its future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in the company s financial condition  could affect these estimates 
long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangibles  and other assets comprise a significant amount of the company s total assets 
the company makes judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires the company to make long term forecasts of its future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
results of operations net income percent percent change change in thousands net income for the year ended december   net income of million established a new record and represented a increase compared to the previous record of million for the year ended december  the increase in net income was driven primarily by the record level of revenues generated in the increase in revenues was due to increases in both sales volume and the average selling price of ceramic proppant and an increase in revenues from fracture and reservoir diagnostics 
the revenue gain was partially offset by the impact of higher costs for natural gas and freight and an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company s ability to increase sales volume of proppant in was limited by manufacturing capacity and inventory levels 
for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million  ahead of the year ended december  net income increased mainly due to an increase in revenues combined with cost efficiencies gained from operating the company s proppant manufacturing facilities at higher throughput rates compared to the higher level of revenues generated in resulted from a substantial increase in sales volume and a slight increase in the average selling price of proppant along with increased revenues from fracture and reservoir diagnostics 
the improvements in revenue and operating efficiency were partially offset by the higher cost of natural gas and higher selling  general and administrative expenses compared to  and a loss on the impairment or disposal of assets in resulting primarily from the replacement of manufacturing equipment in the company s proppant operations 
individual components of financial results by operating segment are discussed below 
revenues percent percent change change in thousands consolidated revenues revenues by operating segment proppant fracture and reservoir diagnostics proppant segment revenues of million for exceeded revenues of million by due to increases in both sales volume and the average selling price of proppant 
worldwide proppant sales volume totaled million pounds for compared to million pounds for demand for proppant was strong throughout the year  but sales volume was consistently limited by the company s production capacity and inventory levels 
increased natural gas drilling activity in north america spurred demand for proppant that led to a increase in north american sales volume compared to and resulted in new sales volume records in the us  canada and mexico 
us sales volume increased versus the previous year while sales to canada and mexico increased and  respectively 
sales increases in north america were partially offset by a decline in overseas sales volume compared to the record level of overseas sales set in the primary reason for the overseas sales decline was a slowdown in russian sales due to an increase in the availability of locally produced proppant in that region  the pricing of which excludes the customs duties  tariffs and transportation expenses associated with imported products 
the company is addressing this situation through the construction of a manufacturing facility in kopeysk  russia  which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of excluding sales to russia  overseas sales volume increased compared to  however  russian sales still led all overseas markets in international sales  which include overseas markets and the north american markets of canada and mexico  accounted for of sales volume in compared to in the average selling price of proppant was per pound in compared to in the higher average selling price was due to an increase in list prices for the company s products and energy surcharges that went into effect during fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment revenues of million for increased compared to million for the increase in revenues from the prior year was primarily due to a increase in mapping services related to gas well completions in north america 
fracture and reservoir diagnostics revenue benefited from an increase in global drilling and fracturing activity in as well as increased acceptance and utilization of the company s fracture mapping services in the barnett shale formation in north central texas and other unconventional natural gas formations 
proppant segment revenues of million for were higher than revenues of million 
proppant sales volume increased compared to  driven by a increase in international sales 
domestic shipments remained strong in with a increase over  but were limited by manufacturing capacity and inventory levels 
worldwide proppant sales volume of million pounds in surpassed volume of million pounds 
international sales growth for included increases of in overseas shipments  in canada and in mexico 
the increase in overseas sales in was mostly driven by increased demand for the company s products in russia 
sales in overseas markets in were aided by the mid year addition of a second production line at the company s luoyang  china plant 
international shipments accounted for of sales volume in compared to in the average selling price of per pound of ceramic proppant increased compared to in the higher average unit price was due to the impact of a price increase in july and a shift in the mix of products sold toward higher priced proppants 
fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment revenues of million for increased compared to million for the increase in revenues from the prior year was primarily due to a increase in mapping services in north america and a increase in international engineering services 
gross profit percent percent change change in thousands consolidated gross profit consolidated gross profit gross profit by operating segment proppant proppant fracture and reservoir diagnostics fracture and reservoir diagnostics the company s proppant segment cost of sales consists of manufacturing costs  packaging and transportation expenses associated with the delivery of the company s products to its customers and handling costs related to maintaining finished goods inventory and operating the company s remote stocking facilities 
variable manufacturing costs include raw materials  labor  utilities and repair and maintenance supplies 
fixed manufacturing costs include depreciation  property taxes on production facilities  insurance and factory overhead 
cost of sales for the company s fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment consists of both variable and fixed components 
variable costs include labor costs  subcontracting  travel and other variable expenses associated with the delivery of the mapping and reservoir monitoring services 
fixed costs include the depreciation and amortization expenses relating to revenue producing capital equipment

proppant segment gross profit of million for increased by compared to gross profit of million for  primarily due to the increase in sales volume 
gross profit margin declined from in to in the decline in gross profit margin was primarily the result of increased energy costs  including the cost of natural gas consumed in manufacturing proppant and fuel surcharges for raw material and finished product delivery 
while much of these increased costs were passed on to customers in the form of an increased selling price for ceramic proppants  passing these costs through without a markup results in a lower gross profit percentage 
in the fourth quarter of  forward contracts covering the purchase of natural gas requirements for the company s domestic manufacturing facilities expired and the company began paying current market rates for all of its domestic gas 
this resulted in a increase in the delivered price paid by the company for its gas requirements in the fourth quarter of compared to the previous three quarters 
the delivered cost of natural gas used in the company s domestic manufacturing facilities for the full year increased compared the full year for most of  the company experienced an increase in the cost of shipping its product due to rising fuel prices and an increase in volume of expedited sales to meet us customer demand 
the company s conventional distribution method in north america is to ship product by rail from manufacturing facilities to one of its eight north american stocking locations  then ship by truck from stocking location to customer 
however  following a draw down of inventory levels during record sales volume quarters in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  strong demand for the remainder of regularly required the company to bypass its conventional distribution method and expedite shipments by more expensive truck hauls from manufacturing facilities directly to customers 
fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment gross profit of million for increased by compared to gross profit of million for primarily due to the increase in revenue for this segment 
gross profit margin for this segment declined from in to in due to increased labor and equipment costs in preparation for anticipated geographic and service offering growth and increased subcontractor costs due to a change in the mix of service offerings 
proppant segment gross profit of million for was higher than gross profit of million due to a significant increase in sales volume 
gross profit margin improved to in compared to in improvement in gross profit margin was primarily due to a slight increase in the average sales price of proppant and higher throughput at the company s manufacturing facilities 
manufacturing facilities operated at of capacity in compared to of capacity in the factors contributing to improvement in the gross profit margin were partially offset by an increase in proppant manufacturing cost caused by higher fuel prices 
fracture and reservoir diagnostics segment gross profit of million for was higher than gross profit of million

consolidated income tax expense of million for the year ended december  increased compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to the increase in taxable income resulting from the company s improved performance 
the effective income tax rate of of pretax income decreased from in due to a new permanent deduction for domestic manufacturing activities enacted as part of the american jobs creation act of  an increase in the company s tax exempt interest income and a reduction in estimated state income taxes in the us resulting from a decrease in the amount of income apportioned to the states in which the company does business 
consolidated income tax expense of million for the year ended december  increased over the year ended december  due to the increase in taxable income resulting from the company s improved performance

uses of cash included million of capital spending  million of cash dividends and million investment in a joint venture 
major capital spending included million on the new proppant manufacturing facility in toomsboro  georgia  million on the new manufacturing facility in the russian federation and million on microseismic equipment for use in providing fracture mapping and reservoir diagnostics services 
for a discussion regarding the reclassification of auction rate securities from cash and cash equivalents to short term investments at december   see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the relatively high prices for oil and natural gas in the current spot and futures markets will continue to spur drilling and fracturing activity worldwide 
consequently  the company expects demand for its products to remain strong 
the company intends to continue operating all of its manufacturing facilities near full capacity for the remainder of the year 
in the short term  the company believes it will continue to be adversely impacted by the high price of natural gas 
natural gas is a large component of the company s manufacturing costs  accounting for more than of direct manufacturing costs in us manufacturing facilities and over of the company s total cost of sales 
the company should see improvement in pricing during the first quarter of as it gets the full benefit of price increases announced in the fourth quarter of the increase in pricing should help counterbalance the impact of the high cost of natural gas 
subject to its financial condition  the amount of funds generated from operations and the level of capital expenditures  the company s current intention is to continue to pay quarterly dividends to holders of its common stock 
on july   the board of directors declared a three for two stock split of its common stock  which was effected via a stock dividend on august   to the stockholders of record at the close of business on august  on january   the company s board of directors approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend of per share to shareholders of the company s common stock on january  the company has total projected capital expenditures of approximately million in  including final spending on its manufacturing facility in toomsboro  georgia  spending to complete its manufacturing facility in the russian federation  expansion of distribution facilities and acquisition or construction of additional fracture mapping tools 
however  if the company decides to move forward with adding a second production line to the toomsboro facility  capital expenditures in could increase by million 
the russian plant  which is on schedule to be completed in the fourth quarter of at an expected total cost of million  is designed to have an annual production capacity of million pounds 
the company s new plant in toomsboro  georgia was substantially complete at the end of that plant is designed to have initial annual production capacity of million pounds and is expected to produce between million pounds and million pounds in  with initial production available for sale in the first quarter of the company maintains an unsecured line of credit of million 
as of december   there was no outstanding debt under the credit agreement 
the company anticipates that cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities and funds available under its line of credit will be sufficient to meet planned operating expenses  tax obligations and capital expenditures for the next months 
the company also believes that it could acquire additional debt financing  if needed 
based on these assumptions  the company believes that its fixed costs could be met even with a moderate decrease in demand for the company s products 
off balance sheet arrangements the company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due in period less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations primarily railroad equipment purchase obligations natural gas contracts raw materials contracts equipment purchases other purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations operating lease obligations relate primarily to railroad equipment leases and include leases of other property  plant and equipment 
see note and note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company uses natural gas to power its domestic manufacturing plants 
from time to time the company enters into contracts to purchase a portion of the anticipated natural gas requirements 
the contracts are at specified prices and are typically short term in duration 
as of december   the last contract was due to expire in february the company has entered into contracts to supply raw materials  primarily kaolin and bauxite  to each of its manufacturing plants 
each of the contracts is described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
four of the contracts do not require the company to purchase minimum annual quantities  but do require the purchase of minimum annual percentages  ranging from to of the respective plants requirements for the specified raw materials 
one contract requires the company to purchase a minimum annual quantity of material  which is included in the above table 
the company committed to purchase million in equipment related to constructing the manufacturing plant in the russian federation and adding a second line to the new manufacturing facility in toomsboro  georgia 
in the event of cancellation  some of the commitments have cancellation clauses that would require the company to pay expenses incurred by manufacturers to date and or a penalty fee 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s major market risk exposure is to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact its investments in china and russia 
when necessary  the company may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
there were no such foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  the company has a million line of credit with its primary commercial bank 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  the company may elect to pay interest at either a fluctuating base rate established by the bank from time to time or at a rate based on the rate established in the london inter bank market 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement at december  the company does not believe that it has any material exposure to market risk associated with interest rates
