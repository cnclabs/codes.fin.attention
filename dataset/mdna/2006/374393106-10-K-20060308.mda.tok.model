in february  the company announced the addition of unitedhealthcare as an additional health plan option for new clients beginning in the second quarter of unitedhealthcare will be available as an option to existing clients effective october  k plans the company offers to clients served under the co employment model a k retirement plan  designed to be a multiple employer plan under section c of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
generally  employee benefit plans are subject to provisions of both the code and the employee retirement income security act erisa 
in connection with prior years acquisitions  the company assumed certain employee benefit plans  including two multiple employer k plans 
internal company employees as of december   the company employed  internal employees of whom were located at the company s headquarters in bradenton  florida 
the remaining employees were located in the company s branch offices 
none of the company s internal employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
industry regulation general numerous federal and state laws and regulations relating to employment matters  benefit plans and employment taxes affect the operations of the company or specifically address issues associated with co employment 
many of these federal and state laws were enacted before the development of non traditional employment relationships  such as professional employer organizations  temporary employment and other employment related outsourcing arrangements and  therefore  do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of a professional employer organization 
other federal and state laws and regulations are relatively new  and administrative agencies and federal and state courts have not yet interpreted or applied these regulations to the company s business or its industry 
the development of additional regulations and interpretation of those regulations can be expected to evolve over time 
in addition  from time to time  states have considered  and may in the future consider  imposing certain taxes on gross revenues or service fees of the company and its competitors 
twenty nine states  including nine states where the company has offices arizona  florida  maryland  minnesota  new jersey  new york  north carolina  tennessee and texas  have passed laws that have 
table of contents licensing  registration or other regulatory requirements for professional employer organizations  and several other states are currently considering similar regulation 
such laws vary from state to state  but generally codify the requirements that a professional employer organization must reserve the right to hire  terminate and discipline client employees and secure workers compensation insurance coverage 
the company delegates or assigns such rights to the client where allowed under state law  currently  new hampshire is the only state where such delegation is not allowed 
the laws also generally provide for monitoring the fiscal responsibility of professional employer organizations and  in many cases  the licensure of the controlling officers of the professional employer organization 
in addition  some states through legislative or other regulatory action have proposed to modify the manner in which the company is allowed to provide services to its clients  which could increase the administrative cost associated with providing such services 
to the extent modifications are adopted in these states  other states may follow 
for example  california is considering modifying the interpretation of the law that governs workers compensation insurance coverage to require insurance carriers to issue policies directly to the company s clients rather than through the company under a single master policy 
adoption of this interpretation would increase the company s administrative expense in providing workers compensation coverage to its clients 
the company believes that its operations are currently in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal and state statutes and regulations 
k plans in order to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the code  k plans must be established and maintained by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees 
generally  an entity is an employer of certain workers for federal employment tax purposes if an employment relationship exists between the entity and the workers under the common law test of employment 
in addition  the officers of a corporation are deemed to be employees of that corporation for federal employment tax purposes 
the common law test of employment  as applied by the internal revenue service irs  involves an examination of many factors to ascertain whether an employment relationship exists between a worker and a purported employer 
such a test is generally applied to determine whether an individual is an independent contractor or an employee for federal employment tax purposes and not to determine whether each of two or more companies is a co employer 
substantial weight is typically given to the question of whether the purported employer directs and controls the details of an individual s work 
the courts have provided that the common law employer test applied to determine the existence of an employer employee relationship for federal employment tax purposes can be different than the common law test applied to determine employer status for other federal tax purposes 
in addition  control and supervision have been held to be less important factors when determining employer status for erisa purposes 
on may   the irs released guidance applicable solely to the tax qualified status of defined contribution retirement plans maintained by professional employer organizations 
in that guidance  the irs declared that it would not assert a violation of the exclusive benefit rule under section a of the code if a professional employer organization that maintains a single employer k retirement plan for client employees takes certain remedial action by the last day of the first plan year beginning on or after january  the company maintains a frozen single employer k retirement plan benefiting certain client employees and took remedial action to qualify for the relief provided under the irs guidance within the applicable deadline 
as part of the remedial action  the plan was terminated 
the company has obtained irs approval to proceed with the plan termination and distribution of assets approximately million as of december  
in conjunction with the acquisition of epix holdings  inc epix in march of  the company assumed sponsorship of a frozen single employer plan 
prior to the acquisition  epix took remedial action to qualify for the relief provided under the irs guidance 
the plan was terminated prior to the applicable 
table of contents deadline and the company has obtained irs approval to proceed with the plan termination and distribution of assets approximately  at december  
the status of the active multiple employer k retirement plans maintained by the company is unaffected by the irs guidance 
erisa requirements employee pension and welfare benefit plans are also governed by erisa 
erisa defines an employer as any person acting directly as an employer  or indirectly in the interest of an employer  in relation to an employee benefit plan 
erisa defines the term employee as any individual employed by an employer 
the courts have held that the common law test of employment must be applied to determine whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor under erisa 
however  in applying that test  control and supervision are less important for erisa purposes when determining whether an employer has assumed responsibility for an individual s benefits status 
a definitive judicial interpretation of employer in the context of a professional employer organization or employee leasing arrangement has not been established 
if the company were found not to be an employer for erisa purposes  its former k retirement plan would not comply with erisa 
further  the company would be subject to liabilities  including penalties  with respect to its cafeteria benefits plan for failure to withhold and pay taxes applicable to salary deferral contributions by its clients employees 
in addition  as a result of such a finding  the company and its plans would not enjoy  with respect to client employees  the preemption of state laws provided by erisa and could be subject to varying state laws and regulation  as well as to claims based upon state common laws 
federal employment taxes as a co employer  the company assumes responsibility and liability for the payment of federal and state employment taxes with respect to wages and salaries paid to client employees 
there are essentially three types of federal employment tax obligations i withholding of income tax governed by code section  et seq  ii obligations under fica  governed by code section  et seq  and iii obligations under futa  governed by code section  et seq 
under these code sections  employers have the obligation to withhold and remit the employer portion and  where applicable  the employee portion of these taxes 
among other employment tax issues related to whether professional employer organizations are employers of client employees are issues under the code provisions applicable to federal employment taxes 
the issue arises as to whether the company is responsible for payment of employment taxes on wages and salaries paid to such client employees 
code section d  which applies to federal income tax withholding requirements  contains an exception to the general common law test applied to determine whether an entity is an employer for purposes of federal income tax withholding 
the courts have extended this common law employer exception to apply for both fica and futa tax purposes 
code section d states that if the person for whom services are rendered does not have control of the payment of wages  the employer for this purpose is the person having control of the payment of wages 
the treasury regulations issued under code section d state that a third party can be deemed to be the employer of workers under this section for income tax withholding purposes where the person for whom services are rendered does not have legal control of the payment of wages 
although several courts have examined code section d with regard to professional employer organizations  its ultimate scope has not been delineated 
moreover  the irs has  to date  relied extensively on the common law test of employment in determining liability for failure to comply with federal income tax withholding requirements 
accordingly  while the company believes that it can assume the withholding obligations for client employees  if the company fails to meet these obligations  the client may be held jointly and severally liable 
while this interpretive issue has not  to the company s knowledge  discouraged clients from utilizing the company s services  there can be no assurance that a definitive adverse resolution of this issue would not do so in the future

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to other information contained in this filing  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business 
we are dependent upon technology services and any damage  interruptions or failures in our computer and telecommunications systems could adversely affect our existing client relationships and our ability to attract new clients 
our business could be interrupted and we may lose data as a result of damage to or disruption of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems from natural disasters  floods  fire  power loss  hardware or software malfunctions  penetration by computer hackers  terrorist acts  vandalism  sabotage  computer viruses  vendor performance failures or insolvency  and other causes 
our business involves the storage and transmission of clients proprietary information and any system or equipment failure we experience could adversely affect our clients businesses  and expose us to litigation and possible liability 
in addition  as a result of any of the foregoing  our goodwill could be damaged  and we could be exposed to significant contractual liability 
the precautions that we have taken to protect ourselves and minimize the impact of such events such as our disaster recovery plans may not be adequate  and we may be unable to recover data used in our operations 
in addition  techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target 
as a result  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of our security measures could be harmed  and we could lose sales and clients 
our insurance related loss reserves may be inadequate to cover our ultimate liability for losses and as a result our financial results could be harmed 
we maintain loss reserves to cover our liabilities for the costs of our health care and workers compensation programs 
these reserves are not an exact calculation of our liability  but  rather  are estimates based on actuarial and statistical projections of claims administration and settlement costs and expenses 
in addition to current and historical claims payment patterns and relevant trends  our health benefit reserves are based primarily on an independent actuarial estimate of claims incurred  but not reported  and claims reported but not yet paid 
our workers compensation reserves are based primarily on an independent actuarial estimate of future claims 
variables in the reserve estimation may be affected by both internal and external factors  such as changes in claims handling procedures  fluctuations in the administrative costs associated with the program  economic inflation  interest rates  legal determinations and legislative changes 
although our reserves estimates are regularly refined as historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled  because of the uncertainties of estimating loss reserves  we cannot be certain that our reserves are adequate  and actual costs and expenses may exceed our reserves 
if our reserves are insufficient to cover actual losses  we would have to strengthen our reserves and incur potentially material charges to our earnings 
our results of operations may be adversely affected if insurance coverage for workers compensation or medical benefits is not available or if we lose relationships with our key providers 
as part of our full range of services  we offer medical benefits coverage and workers compensation insurance to our clients 
we depend on a small number of key providers for the majority of our medical benefits and workers compensation coverage  including aig  bcbsfl and aetna 
if any of our insurance providers discontinue coverage  the time and expense of providing replacement coverage could be disruptive to our business and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
replacement coverage could lead to client dissatisfaction and attrition especially since clients may terminate with either or days notice due to the lack of continuity between coverage providers and the terms and conditions of their respective coverage plans 
in addition  if at any time we are unable to renew our existing policies on financial terms and premium rates acceptable to us  our ability to provide such insurance and benefits to our clients would be adversely impacted  which could lead to significant client attrition  and our results of operations 
table of contents could be adversely affected 
our inability to renew existing policies may jeopardize compliance with state regulatory requirements and subject us to fines and extra costs to satisfy the state requirements  or  at worst  eliminate our ability to provide services in those states 
the loss of our ability to provide services  even for a short period  may negatively impact our image with our clients and lead to the termination of our service agreements 
our headquarters  many of our clients headquarters  and the facilities of many of the third parties on which we rely to provide us and our clients with critical services are located in an area of the united states that is susceptible to hurricane damage and other natural disasters 
our florida facilities  including our principal executive offices and field support offices  as well as certain of our vendors and a significant number of our clients are located in an area prone to natural disasters such as hurricanes  floods  tornadoes  and other adverse weather conditions 
a hurricane or other disaster could significantly disrupt our services  particularly if it results in prolonged disruptions to the internet and telecommunications services on which we heavily rely 
the precautions that we have taken to protect ourselves and minimize the impact of such events such as our disaster recovery plans may not be adequate  and we may lose  not be able to access  or be unable to recover data used in our operations 
in addition  our regional clients could also suffer the effects of a significant natural disaster and not be able to fulfill their contractual requirements pursuant to the terms of our professional services agreement 
our business could be materially and adversely affected should our ability to provide services and products  or our ability to collect our service fees  be impacted by such an event 
our acquisition strategy subjects us to numerous risks 
one important component of our growth strategy is to pursue selective acquisitions 
this strategy entails numerous risks  including the following integration operational risks 
we face risks associated with integrating new organizations  including their management  personnel and clients  into our established business 
an inability to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our operations could cause attrition of acquired personnel and clients 
an acquisition may not provide the benefits originally anticipated by management while we continue to incur operating expenses to provide the services provided formerly by the acquired company 
financial risks 
we may finance an acquisition with cash  by issuing equity securities which could be dilutive to existing shareholders or by incurring debt which would increase our leverage and interest expense 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to access the capital markets for these transactions 
legal risks 
an acquired company may have liabilities that are difficult to assess  for which there are inadequate reserves and that may be significant 
for example  employee benefit plans of an acquired company could result in liability due to the plan s failure comply with applicable laws and regulations 
even if we pursue possible acquisition candidates  we cannot assure you that we will be able to close on them at attractive prices or at all 
many of these risks are beyond our ability to control 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve this component of our growth strategy 
if any of these risks were to materialize  it could also have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
in addition  the risks summarized above could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time 
we depend on the technology of third parties licensed to us  and the loss or inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs  reduced service levels or delayed sales of our products and services 
we rely on third party vendors for software  and if their products are not available  or are inadequate  our business could be seriously harmed 
for example  we process payroll for all of our client employees using oracle s hrms and payroll processing applications 
our service delivery capability incorporates and relies on oracle software that we license directly from oracle 
if oracle or our other software vendors change or fail to 
table of contents maintain a product that we are using or do not permit use of that product by our clients or us  or if our licensing agreements are terminated or not renewed  we could be forced to delay or discontinue our services until equivalent technology can be found  licensed and installed 
we could also be forced to pay significantly higher licensing fees with respect to such equivalent technology 
in addition  our products depend upon the successful operation of third party services and products  and any undetected errors in these products could prevent the implementation or impair the functionality of our products  delay new product introductions  and harm our reputation and sales 
we are dependent upon key personnel  and the recruitment and retention of key employees may be difficult and expensive 
we believe that the successful operation of our business is dependent upon our retention of key personnel including  particularly  our chairman and chief executive officer  erik vonk 
in general  the employment of our key personnel  including mr 
vonk  may be terminated by either the employee or us at any time  without cause or advance notice  subject to severance obligations under specified circumstances 
if any of these individuals  particularly mr 
vonk  were unable or unwilling to continue working for us  we could have difficulty finding a replacement  and our operations and profitability could be adversely affected  which would have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock 
in addition  we are not the beneficiary under any life insurance contracts covering any of our key personnel 
we also relied heavily upon stock options to supplement compensation for many of our key employees  and if we continue to grant options to these employees  the treatment of options as an expense in response to new regulatory requirements may significantly increase our reported costs 
we depend on attracting and retaining qualified service consultants and sales associates 
our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain human resource consultants hrcs and business development managers bdms who possess the specific skills and experience necessary to identify new clients and fulfill our existing clients needs 
finding and retaining qualified hrcs and bdms is difficult because of the specific skill set that we require in order for us to adequately operate in the complex human resource regulatory environment 
we compete for qualified hrcs not only with other human resource service providers  but also with internal human resource departments 
our ability to attract and retain qualified hrcs and bdms could be impaired by any diminution of our reputation  decrease in compensation levels  restructuring of our compensation system  or competition from our competitors 
if we cannot attract and retain qualified individuals  the quality of our services may deteriorate and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our quarterly revenues may fluctuate  and we may not be able to sustain our level of total revenue or our historical rate of revenue growth 
our revenue  margins and results from operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate 
quarterly variations in our revenues and operating results occur as a result of a number of factors  including changes to our reserves for workers compensation  medical benefit plans  and state unemployment taxes  new product introductions or announcements by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new services  pricing changes or increases  the hiring and training of additional staff  and general economic conditions 
due to the presence of any of these factors  we may not be able to sustain our level of total revenue or our historical rate of revenue growth on a quarterly or annual basis 
our operating results could fall below our 
table of contents targets and the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline significantly 
our short term results may be impacted due to changes in health insurance claims  state unemployment tax rates and workers compensation rates  which we may not be able to immediately pass through to our clients 
health insurance claims  state unemployment taxes and workers compensation rates are primarily determined by our claims experience and comprise a significant portion of our actual costs 
should we experience a significant increase in claims activity  we may experience a substantial increase in our health insurance premiums  unemployment taxes  or workers compensation insurance rates 
our ability to pass such increases through to our clients may be delayed and our clients may not agree to the increase  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as a result of our co employment relationship with our clients and client employees  we may be subject to liabilities as a result of their acts or omissions 
we enter into a contractual relationship with each of our clients  whereby the client transfers certain employment related risks and liabilities to us and retains other risks and liabilities 
many federal and state laws that apply to the employer employee relationship do not specifically address the obligations and responsibilities of this co employment relationship 
consequently  we may be subject to liability for violations of employment or discrimination laws by our clients despite the contractual division of responsibilities between us  even if we do not participate in such violations 
although our professional services agreement provides that the client will indemnify us for any liability attributable to its own or its employees conduct  we may not be able to effectively enforce or collect such contractual indemnification 
any such liability imposed upon us could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
because we assume the obligation to make wage  tax and regulatory payments of behalf of our clients  we are exposed to certain credit risks with respect to our larger clients 
under the terms of our professional services agreement  we generally assume responsibility for and manage the risks associated with each of our client s employee payroll obligations  including the payment of salaries  wages and associated taxes  and  at the client s option  the responsibility for providing group health  welfare and retirement benefits to each client employee 
in this co employment relationship  we directly assume these obligations  and unlike other payroll processing service providers  we issue payroll checks to each client employee drawn on our own bank accounts 
our obligation to make these payments is fixed for the period of time in which a client s employees remain co employees of ours  even if the client fails to satisfy its contractual obligation to us to remit its payroll  taxes and associated service fees 
if we are unable to collect these payments from our larger clients  we may face significant adverse impact 
our professional services agreement allows clients to terminate their relationship with us upon either or days notice  and as a result  we could lose a significant number of customers in a short period of time 
in order to utilize our professional services  each of our clients is required to enter into our professional services agreement  which generally provides for an initial one year term  subject to termination by our client or us at any time upon either or days prior written notice 
following the initial term  the contract may be renewed  terminated or continued on a month to month basis 
as a result  a significant number of our clients may terminate their agreement with us at any time 
in particular  they may decide to discontinue our services or their relationship with us due to our attempts to increase our administrative and other services fees or increase our medical or workers compensation insurance premiums 
clients may also be unwilling to pay for broadened service offerings if additional or increased fees accompany such changes 
these termination provisions could cause us to lose a significant number of customers in a short period of time or make it difficult for us to increase our prices  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 

table of contents our business is subject to risks associated with geographic market concentration 
while we currently have offices in states and client employees in all states and the district of columbia  our florida operations accounted for approximately of our total client billings in  in and in as a result of the size of our base of client employees in florida and anticipated continued growth from our florida operations  our profitability over the next several years is expected to be largely dependent on economic and regulatory conditions in florida 
if the florida economy experiences an economic downturn or its growth rate slows  our profitability and growth prospects may be adversely affected 
in addition  there is no assurance that we will be able to duplicate in other markets the revenue growth and operating results experienced in florida 
we may be required to provide significant collateral for our obligations to our insurance providers and the amount of cash necessary to provide that collateral may increase in the future 
our workers compensation provider requires and our health care insurance providers may require collateralization of our insurance plans 
the extent of such requirements is dependent upon factors such as our financial condition  as well as the workers compensation and health insurance claims experience of our clients  over which we have little control except in the decision to initially accept and retain such clients 
these collateral requirements may affect our need for capital  as well as our profitability 
we may not be able to raise or provide the additional capital or collateral  if needed 
in addition  we may be required to post additional collateral for the benefit of our insurance providers as a result of growing our business  which amounts could be significant  and may cause a significant amount of our cash to be restricted from other uses 
we operate in a complex regulatory environment and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our business 
the human resource environment is subject to a number of laws and regulations  including those applicable to payroll practices  taxes  benefits administration  employment practices and data privacy 
because our clients have employees in states throughout the united states  we must perform our services in compliance with the legal and regulatory requirements of multiple jurisdictions 
some of these laws and regulations may be difficult to ascertain or interpret and may change over time  and the addition of new services may subject us to additional laws and regulations 
if we are unable to continue to provide certain contractual obligations  such as the payment of employment taxes on the salaries and wages paid to client employees  due to an adverse determination regarding our regulatory status as an employer  our clients may be held jointly and severally liable for such payments 
violation of these laws and regulations could subject us to fines and penalties  damage our reputation  constitute breach of our client contracts and impair our ability to do business in various jurisdictions or in accordance with established processes 
in addition  many states in which we operate have enacted laws that require licensing or registration of professional employer organizations  including florida and texas  and additional states are considering such legislation 
we may not be able to satisfy the licensing requirements or other applicable regulations of any particular state  or we may be unable to renew our licenses in the states in which we currently operate upon expiration of such licenses  which could prevent us from providing services to client employees in a certain state 
the market for our services and our revenue growth depends on our ability to use the internet as a means of delivering human resource services and this exposes us to various security risks 
we rely on the internet as a primary mechanism for delivering services to our clients and use public networks to transmit and store extremely confidential information about our clients and their employees 
our target clients may not continue to be receptive to human resource services delivered over the internet because of concerns over transaction security  user privacy  the reliability and quality of internet service and other reasons 
a security breach could disrupt our operations  damage our reputation and expose us to litigation and possible liability 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to address security breaches  and we cannot be certain that our security measures will be adequate 
in addition  emerging or uncertain laws and regulations relating to internet user privacy  property ownership  intellectual property  export of encryption technology  and libel could impair our existing internet usage

overview and introduction for a discussion of the company s business see item business general 
the company believes that the human resource outsourcing market of small and medium sized businesses  as measured by the number of employees per client  is by far its most attractive market in terms of customer concentration  need for customized solutions  price sensitivity  capital investment  new client acquisition cost  sales cycle and market growth 
the company believes that the human resource outsourcing competitive landscape is highly fragmented and populated by various point solution providers who offer only segments of the entire service offering that the company provides to its clients 
the company focuses on the professional service fees that it earns from its clients as the primary source of its net income and cash flow 
when delivering its human resource outsourcing solution to its clients through a co employment relationship  the company is also responsible for providing workers compensation and unemployment insurance benefits to its client s employees as well as health and welfare benefits 
in so doing  the company has an opportunity to generate net income and cash but does not believe that this should be a significant portion of its long term overall business profitability 
the company believes that the primary challenge it faces in delivering its human resource outsourcing solutions is its ability to convince small and medium sized businesses to accept the concept of human resource outsourcing 
the company believes that most small and medium sized businesses outsource certain aspects of the company s total solution  including payroll administration  health and welfare administration 
table of contents and providing workers compensation insurance  but that only a small number of businesses outsource the entire offering that the company provides 
the company continues to focus on increasing the profitability of each client employee as well as on increasing the overall number of client employees serviced 
the company believes that it can increase the overall number of client employees serviced through i the enlargement of its target market focus to client prospects having employees  ii the introduction of a mid market segment with a target market focus of client prospects having between  employees  iii improved human resource outsourcing service offerings that will lead to higher current client employee retention levels  and iv acquisitions of other human resource outsourcing client portfolios and service providers 
the company has announced a long range strategic objective of providing its range of insourced human resource services to its clients on a non co employment platform 
this option provides significant flexibility for a client by allowing it to retain the benefits and insurance programs of their choice without the risk to the company associated with providing workers compensation and healthcare insurance programs to its clients 
the company expects to evolve towards this business model 
to date  the results of this new business model have not had a significant impact on the company s revenues or results of operations 
the following table provides information that the company utilizes when assessing the financial performance of its business  the fluctuations of which are discussed under the results of operations for the years ended december  change statistical data client employees at period end clients at period end average number of client employees at period end clients at period end average number of client employees paid by month average wage per average number of client employees paid by month professional service fees per average number of client employees paid by month gross profit per average number of client employees paid by month operating income per average number of client employees paid by month number of clients measured by individual client fein 
the average number of client employees paid by month is calculated based upon the sum of the number of paid client employees at the end of each month in the year divided by months 
all other statistical information above is based upon actual year to date amounts divided by the average number of client employees paid by month 
the company believes that the primary challenges to its ability to increase the overall number of client employees serviced are the amount of time required for sales personnel to begin to acquire new client employees may be longer than anticipated  the current client employee retention levels may decrease if clients decide to use alternative providers to service their human resource outsourcing needs  other human resource outsourcing client employee portfolios or service providers may not be available for acquisition due to price or quality  
table of contents the company under its co employed service option may not be able to continue to provide insurance related products of a quality to acquire new client employees and to retain current client employees  and the time to achieve acceptance by prospective clients of the company s new business model may be longer than anticipated 
acquisitions epix acquisition 
on march   the company acquired the human resource outsourcing client portfolio of epix and certain of its subsidiaries 
the transaction was accomplished by an assignment from epix and its subsidiaries to the company of all of its client service agreements  which covered approximately  clients and approximately  client employees 
see further information at note to the consolidated financial statements 
teamstaff acquisition 
on november   the company acquired the human resource outsourcing client portfolio of teamstaff  inc teamstaff together with certain other assets 
the teamstaff acquisition was accomplished through an assignment by teamstaff and its subsidiaries to the company of all of its client service agreements  which covered approximately  clients and approximately  client employees 
see further information in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenues the gross billings that the company charges its clients under its professional services agreement include each client employee s gross wages  a consolidated service fee and  to the extent elected by the clients  health and welfare benefit plan costs 
the company s consolidated service fee  which is primarily computed on a percentage of payroll basis  is intended to yield a profit to the company and to cover the costs of the human resource outsourcing services provided by the company to the client  certain employment related taxes and workers compensation insurance coverage 
the professional service fee component of the consolidated service fee related to human resource outsourcing varies according to a number of factors  such as the size and the location of the client 
the component of the consolidated service fee related to workers compensation and unemployment insurance is based  in part  on the client s historical claims experience 
all charges by the company are invoiced along with each periodic payroll provided to the client 
the company s long term profitability is largely dependent upon the company s success in generating professional service fees by providing value to its clients 
the company accounts for its revenues using the accrual method of accounting 
under the accrual method of accounting  the company recognizes its revenues in the period in which the client employee performs work 
the company accrues revenues and unbilled receivables for consolidated service fees relating to work performed by client employees but unpaid at the end of each period 
in addition  the related costs of services are accrued as a liability for the same period 
subsequent to the end of each period  those wages are paid and the related service fees are billed 
the company reports revenues from consolidated service fees in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company reports as revenues  on a gross basis  the total amount billed to clients for professional service fees  and  to the extent applicable  health and welfare benefit plan fees  workers compensation and unemployment insurance fees 
the company reports revenues on a gross basis for these fees because the company is the primary obligor and deemed to be the principal in these transactions under eitf no 
the company reports revenues on a net basis for the amount billed to clients for client employee salaries  wages and certain payroll related taxes less amounts paid to client employees and taxing authorities for these salaries  wages and taxes 
the company s revenues are impacted by the number of client employees it serves  the number of client employees paid each period and the related wages paid  and the number of client employees participating in the company s benefit plans 
because a portion of the consolidated service fee charged is computed as a percentage of gross payroll  revenues are affected by fluctuations in the gross payroll caused by the 
table of contents composition of the employee base  inflationary effects on wage levels and differences in the local economies in the company s markets 
cost of services cost of services includes health and welfare benefit plan costs  workers compensation insurance costs and state unemployment tax costs  as well as other direct costs associated with the company s revenue generating activities 
health and welfare benefit plan costs are comprised primarily of medical benefit costs  but also include costs of other employee benefits such as dental  vision  disability and group life insurance 
benefit claims incurred by client employees under the benefit plans are expensed as incurred according to the terms of each contract 
in addition  for certain contracts  liability reserves are established for benefit claims reported and not yet paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
in certain instances  the company decides to make a contribution toward the medical benefit plan costs of certain clients 
the contribution is referred to as a health benefit subsidy 
the addition of the client employees of these clients as participants in the company s medical benefit plans helps to stabilize the overall claims experience risk associated with those plans 
an aggregate health benefit subsidy in excess of a planned amount may occur when the medical cost inflation exceeds expected medical cost trends or when medical benefit plan enrollment of those who qualify for a subsidy exceeds expectations 
conversely  a health benefit surplus may occur when the medical cost inflation is less than expected medical cost trends or when medical benefit plan enrollment of those who qualify for a subsidy is less than expected 
the company offers its medical benefit plans through partnerships with premier health care companies 
see item business vendor relationships employee benefit plans 
these companies have extensive provider networks and strong reputations in the markets in which the company operates 
the company seeks to manage its health and welfare benefit plan costs through appropriately designed benefit plans that encourage client employee participation and efficient risk pooling 
substantially all of the company s client employees are covered under the company s workers compensation program with aig  which was effective january  under this program  workers compensation costs for the year are based on premiums paid to aig for the current year coverage  estimated total costs of claims to be paid by the company that fall within the program s deductible  the administrative costs of the program  the return on investment earned with respect to premium dollars paid as part of the program and the discount rate used in determining the present value of future payments to be made under the program 
additionally  any revisions to the ultimate loss estimates of the prior years loss sensitive programs are recognized in the current year 
in states where private insurance is not permitted  client employees are covered by state insurance funds 
premiums paid to state insurance funds are expensed as incurred 
on an annual basis  the company reviews the current and prior year claims information with its independent actuary 
the current accrual rate and overall workers compensation reserves may be adjusted based on current and historical loss trends  fluctuations in the administrative costs associated with the program  actual returns on investment earned with respect to premium dollars paid and changes in the discount rate used to determine the present value of future payments to be made under the program 
the final costs of coverage will be determined by the actual claims experience over time as claims close  by the final administrative costs of the program and by the final return on investment earned with respect to premium dollars paid 
see item business vendor relationships workers compensation insurance 
the company manages its workers compensation costs through the use of carriers who the company believes efficiently manage claims administration and through the company s internal risk assessment and client risk management programs 

table of contents state unemployment taxes are generally paid as a percentage of payroll costs and expensed as incurred 
rates vary from state to state and are generally based upon the employer s claims history 
the company actively manages its state unemployment taxes in the following ways the company s claims administration department actively reviews unemployment claims  and if warranted  contests claims it believes are improper 
many states allow the company to avoid unemployment tax rate increases through the use of voluntary contributions 
where allowed  the company uses multiple state accounts for the classification of its workers 
in certain states  the company elects to report under its clients rates 
the company utilizes state successorship rules for its acquisitions of client portfolios of other companies 
operating expenses operating expenses consist primarily of salaries  wages and commissions associated with the company s internal employees  and general and administrative expenses 
sales and marketing commissions and client referral fees are expensed as incurred 
the company expects that future revenue growth will result in increased operating leverage as the company s fixed operating expenses are leveraged over a larger revenue base 
income taxes the company records income tax expense using the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes

as a result of this process  the company has in the past sought  and may in the future seek  to obtain additional capital from either private or public sources 
the company currently believes that its current cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its operational requirements for the next months  excluding cash required for acquisitions  if any 
in addition  the company has an available unsecured line of credit for million with the bank of america  na see note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f for additional information regarding the company s line of credit 
the company s primary short term liquidity requirements relate to the payment of accrued payroll and payroll taxes of its internal and client employees  accounts payable for capital expenditures  the payment of workers compensation premiums and medical benefit plan premiums

the billings to clients are managed from a cash flow perspective so that a matching generally exists between the time that the funds are received from a client to the time that the funds are paid to the client employees and to the appropriate tax jurisdictions 
as a co employer  and under the terms of the company s professional services agreement  the company is obligated to make certain wage  tax and regulatory payments even if the related wages tax and regulatory payments are not made by its clients 
therefore  the objective of the company is to minimize the credit risk associated with remitting the payroll and associated taxes before receiving the service fees from the client and may include termination of its clients for non payment 
to the extent this objective is not achieved  short term cash requirements can be significant 
in addition  the timing and amount of payments for payroll  payroll taxes and benefit premiums can vary significantly based on various factors  including the day of the week on which a payroll period ends and the existence of holidays at or immediately following a payroll period end 
restricted cash the company is required to collateralize its obligations under its workers compensation and health benefit plans and certain general insurance coverage 
the company uses its certificates of deposits and marketable securities to collateralize these obligations as more fully described below 
certificates of deposits and marketable securities used to collateralize these obligations are designated as restricted in the company s consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had million in total cash and cash equivalents  restricted certificates of deposits and restricted marketable securities  of which million was unrestricted 
at december   the company had pledged million of restricted certificates of deposit and restricted marketable securities  as collateral for certain standby letters of credit  in collateral trust arrangements issued in connection with the company s workers compensation and health benefit plans  and in a rabbi trust in connection with a deferred compensation plan assumed in the epix acquisition as follows december  december  in thousands certificates of deposit restricted bcbsfl standby letter of credit other total certificates of deposit restricted short term marketable securities restricted general insurance collateral obligations aig total short term marketable securities restricted long term marketable securities restricted workers compensation collateral aig rabbi trust total long term marketable securities restricted total restricted assets the company s obligation to bcbsfl under its current contract may require an irrevocable letter of credit loc in favor of bcbsfl if the coverage ratio  as set forth in the bcbsfl agreement  is not maintained

if the company s coverage ratio does not meet the minimum requirement  the company must provide an loc valued at up to two months of projected claims average monthly claims approximated million during 
as of december   the minimum 
table of contents coverage ratio was met and no loc was required 
under the company s previous agreement with bcbsfl  a million certificate of deposit was pledged as collateral for a standby loc 
this collateral was released by bcbsfl as of september  the company was not required to collateralize the aetna program for and the company does not anticipate any additional collateral obligations to be required in for its workers compensation arrangements 
as of december   the company has recorded a million receivable from aig representing premium payments made to aig during through in excess of the present value of the estimated claims liability 
this receivable represents a significant concentration of credit risk for the company 
cash flows from operating activities at december   the company had a net working capital deficit of million  including restricted funds classified as short term of million  as compared to million in net working capital as of december   including million of restricted funds classified as short term 
the decrease in working capital is primarily due to the increase in accrued payroll and payroll taxes as a result of year end timing differences and an increase in the short term deferred tax liability relating to both an increase in the deferred tax provision in and a reduction in the short term deferred tax asset in connection with the filing of the tax return 
these decreases in working capital were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable as a result of the increase in client employees and year end timing differences 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to the effect in of premium payments to aig in excess of projected claim liabilities associated with the through workers compensation program years 
in addition  was favorably impacted by the receipt of million related to aig loss fund refunds and an increase in year end payroll accruals as a result of timing differences compared to if current workers compensation trends continue  the company expects to receive approximately million from aig during the third quarter of as a return of premium from aig in connection with the annual premium adjustment related to the through program years 
additional releases of premium by aig are also anticipated in future years if such trends continue 
the company believes that it has provided to aig a sufficient amount of cash to cover its short term and long term worker s compensation obligations related to open policy years 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  of million  primarily related to million of capital expenditures for technology purchases and leasehold improvements at the company s new corporate facility and was substantially offset by the release and conversion into cash of a million certificate of deposit held by bcbsfl 
this compares to cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  primarily related to the sale of approximately million of restricted marketable securities which were used to fund the purchase of additional insurance from aig related to the program years and the release by aig of approximately million of collateral held in connection with the company s workers compensation program 
these amounts were partially offset in by funds used for business acquisitions million and capital expenditures of million related primarily to information technology 
the company plans to spend approximately million on capital expenditures during primarily related to a significant upgrade for its web based portal access 
this amount includes approximately million of capital expenditures purchased in and paid for in capital expenditures are expected to be funded through operations and or leasing arrangements

the accounting estimates described below are those that the company considers critical in preparing its financial statements because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
while management has used its best estimates based upon facts and circumstances available at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  and changes in the accounting estimates used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of the 
table of contents company s financial condition and results of operations 
management periodically reviews the estimates and assumptions and reflects the effects of revisions in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
management has reviewed the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity 
a detailed description of the significant accounting policies used by the company in preparing its financial statements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f workers compensation receivable reserves for a description of the company s workers compensation program see item business vendor relationships workers compensation 
workers compensation claim payments related to an individual policy year may extend over many years following the date of the worksite injury 
volatility in the dollar amount of workers compensation costs arises when the number of accidents and the severity of these accidents cannot be easily projected  thus resulting in a wide range of possible expected dollar losses for an insurance policy program year 
volatility in the projection of expected dollar losses caused by the number of claims and the severity of these claims is more likely to be associated with industries that have a high risk level associated with them 
at least annually  the company obtains an independent actuarially determined calculation of the estimated costs of claims incurred based on the company s current and historical loss development trends  which is used in the company s development of overall loss estimates related to each open program year 
the estimated costs of the claims calculated may be revised each year by the company and its independent actuary based on developments relating to the actual claims incurred and other factors deemed relevant by the company and its actuary 
a significant amount of judgment is used in this estimation process by both the independent actuary and the company 
the company s consolidated financial statements reflect the estimates made by the company and its independent actuary as well as other factors related to the company s workers compensation programs within the cost of services on the company s consolidated statements of operations and within the workers compensation receivable  the accrued insurance premiums  health and workers compensation insurance reserves or the long term accrued workers compensation insurance reserves on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
to the extent that the premium payments to the carriers and the related accrued interest for the first million per occurrence of claims  for the program year less claim payments made is greater than less than the present value of the remaining claim liability estimate accrued to date  a receivable liability is recorded 
if the actual cost of the claims incurred is higher than the estimates determined by the company and its independent actuary  then the accrual rate used to determine workers compensation costs could increase 
if the actual cost of the claims incurred is lower than the estimates determined by the company and its independent actuary  then the accrual rate used to determine workers compensation costs could decrease 
an increase or decrease to the accrual rate is reflected in the accounting period for which the change in the amount of workers compensation claims is estimated 
due to the considerable variability in the estimate of the amount of workers compensation claims  adjustments to workers compensation costs are sometimes significant 
for example  a change in overall claims loss estimate for claims under the company s deductible levels with no other changes in assumptions would have impacted the net present value of the claims liability and workers compensation cost as of december  by approximately million 

table of contents the workers compensation receivable payable is also affected by the change in the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the remaining claims liability 
fluctuations in the interest rate environment influence the selection of the discount rate 
increases in the discount rate result in a decrease in the net present value of the liability while decreases in the discount rate result in an increase in the net present value of the liability 
for example a change in the discount rate used to calculate the net present value of the claims liability at december  with no other changes in assumptions would have impacted the net present value of the claims liability and workers compensation cost as of december  by approximately million 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company  in conjunction with its quarterly reviews and annual actuarial calculation of estimated costs of claims  revised its previous loss estimates for program years in recognition of the continued favorable claims development trends  which resulted in a total of million in favorable adjustments million net of tax to costs of services and workers compensation receivable 
the following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for workers compensation claims for each of the open program years 
this table excludes the program year for the texas workers compensation insurance fund  which was a guaranteed cost program under which all of the claims were paid by the insurance company without any deductible payment by the company 
the second section  reading down  shows the number of claims reported 
the third section  reading down  shows the number of open claims as of the end of each successive year 
the fourth section  reading down  shows the amount of open case reserves as of the end of each successive year 
the fifth section  reading down  shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability 
the last section  reading down  shows re estimates of the originally recorded reserves as of the end of each successive year  which is the result of the company s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims 
the loss reserve development table for workers compensation claims is cumulative and  therefore  ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior program years

table of contents the following table summarizes the expected undiscounted cash flows related to workers compensation claims payments for the open program years as of december  policy program years through have been combined to reflect the additional insurance coverage purchased from aig during with respect to those program years for the policy years ended december  in thousands initial premium collateral payments to carriers premium collateral refunds received net premiums collateral held by carriers paid claims by insurance carrier estimated future claims covered by premium collateral total estimated ultimate claims estimated interest on premium collateral payments earned through december  estimated return of premium collateral undiscounted the aig workers compensation insurance program provides for a return to the company of excess premiums paid eighteen months after the beginning of each program year and annually thereafter 
the adjustment amount is determined by applying a loss development factor to an estimate of the incurred losses based upon actual claims incurred during the program year and comparing that amount to actual premiums paid for the program year 
the company expects to receive approximately million of returned premiums during the third quarter of relative to the aig program years through all other estimated premium collateral return is expected to be long term 
the first return  if any  from aig for the policy relating to the  and program years will occur june  intangible assets the company has recorded significant intangible assets as a result of the epix and teamstaff acquisitions 
the intangible assets related to the client service agreements acquired were valued by a third party  are considered to have a finite life  and are being amortized over a year period based upon the estimated rate of client attrition 
the original estimate of client attrition was based upon the previous experience of the company 
the company reviews the remaining life of the intangible assets periodically and reviews for impairment if events and circumstances warrant 
changes to the estimated economic life  if any  may result in an increase in amortization expense that may be significant 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
medical benefit plan liabilities the company provides medical benefit plans to its client employees through several medical benefit plan providers under a minimum premium plan with bcbsfl  a retrospective premium plan with aetna for the aetna ppo plan and guarantee cost contracts for all other plans 
with respect to the medical benefit plans with bcbsfl  the company establishes medical benefit plan liabilities for benefit claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these reserves are developed on an annual basis by an independent actuary using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider a number of factors  including paid claims  claim development factors  plan enrollment  medical trend and the potential variability margin in these factors 

table of contents the aetna ppo medical benefit plan is a retrospective funding arrangement under which the plan is subject to additional premium if actual claims are greater than projected at the inception of the policy year 
the maximum recall percentage in any one year is 
amounts above  if any  are subject to carryforward into future policy years 
for each period  the company estimates the relevant factors  based primarily on historical data and uses this information to determine the assumptions underlying the reserve calculations 
an extensive degree of judgment is used in this estimation process 
due to the considerable variability of health care costs  adjustments to health reserves are sometimes significant 
for example  an increase decrease in the margin factor used to calculate claims incurred but not reported by at december  would have resulted in an increase decrease in the incurred but not reported claim reserve of approximately million 
during the year ended december   the company  in conjunction with its annual actuarial calculation of incurred but not reported claims and aetna health plan premium true up  recorded a health plan surplus of million million net of tax  which reduced its cost of services and reserves for incurred but not reported claims 
the following table provides the amount of the medical benefit plan liabilities for benefit claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported in thousands year ended december  incurred but not reported claims other health plan liabilities including recall premiums total medical benefit plan liabilities if the actual amount of the company s medical benefit plan liabilities at the end of each period were to increase decrease from the estimates used by the company  then the company would have an increase in the amount of its future period health benefit subsidy surplus 
the company s consolidated financial statements reflect the estimates made with respect to medical benefit plan liabilities within the cost of services on the company s consolidated statement of operations and within the accrued insurance premiums  health and workers compensation reserves on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
state unemployment taxes the company records state unemployment tax expense based upon taxable wages and tax rates as determined by each state 
state unemployment rates vary by state and are based  in part  on past claims experience 
if the company s claims experience increases  its rates could increase 
additionally  states have the ability to increase unemployment tax rates to cover deficiencies in the state s unemployment tax fund 
as a result our unemployment tax rates have increased over the last several years and are expected to continue to increase 
some states have implemented retroactive rate increases 
these increases cannot always be predicted 
contractual arrangements with the company s clients may limit its ability to pass through these rate increases 
retroactive rate increases that the company determines not to pass on to its clients could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  the company received state unemployment tax assessments of approximately million million net of related income taxes from five states which were retroactive to the beginning of and which related to prior tax years 
the company decided that for most of its clients  the effect of the rate increases from the state unemployment tax assessments related to and prior wages would be absorbed by the company and such rate increases would be passed through to clients in 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its clients to pay their fees 
the company believes that the success of its business is heavily dependent on its ability to collect these fees for several reasons including the following the company is at risk for the payment of its direct costs and client employee payroll costs regardless of whether the clients pay their fees  the large volume and dollar amount of transactions processed by the company  and the periodic and recurring nature of payroll  upon which the fees are based 
the company has established very tight credit policies and generally requires its clients to pay in advance or simultaneously with the delivery of its payroll 
in addition  the company maintains the right to immediately terminate the professional services agreement and associated client employees or to require prepayment  letters of credit or other collateral upon deterioration of a client s financial position or upon nonpayment by a client 
as a result of the company s strict credit policies  customer nonpayments historically have been low as a percentage of revenues see schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts allowance for doubtful accounts on page s 
if the financial condition of the company s clients were to deteriorate rapidly  resulting in non payment  the company s uncollected accounts receivable could increase rapidly and the company could be required to provide for additional allowances 
deferred taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of its assets and liabilities 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and  if necessary  establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if the company were to operate at a loss or is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  then the company could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  resulting in a substantial increase in the company s effective tax rate
