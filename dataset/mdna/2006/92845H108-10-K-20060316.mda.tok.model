table of contents we derive most of our revenue from hbx  our web analytics application 
web analytics refers to the collection  analysis and reporting of information about internet user activity 
our hbx application collects data from web browsers  processes that data and delivers analytic reports of online behavior to our customers on demand  allowing them to improve their websites and their online marketing campaigns 
we deliver our hbx  site search and web content management services on demand over the internet using secure  proprietary and scalable applications and system architectures 
this on demand delivery model allows us to concurrently serve a large number of customers and to efficiently distribute the workload across our networks of servers 
our hbx technology is relatively straightforward to implement for most customers  which allows these customers to avoid expensive  up front hardware expenses and software license fees and to benefit from lower administration costs compared to traditional software licensing 
our analytic reporting and data collection processes can be integrated with third party applications through our published apis and through standard format data feeds 
our services are offered by subscription agreements  typically with terms of one to three years 
as of december   we had over  customers purchasing services from our active marketing suite 
our direct sales force sells our services to a broad range of organizations in many industries including sports and entertainment  news  retail  financial services  travel  technology  manufacturing  telecommunications and education 
our top ten customers by revenue in were allstate insurance  best buy corporation  british sky broadcasting  cisco  comcast 
net  fedex corporate services  fox sports 
com  nokia  pc world communication and the walt disney internet group 
none of our customers individually accounted for more than of our total revenue for the years ended december  or december  the walt disney internet group accounted for of our total revenue in the year ended december  we generated approximately  and of revenue  respectively  from subsidiaries located outside the united state for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we anticipate that the percentage of revenue from international operations will remain consistent or grow as we increase our direct sales force and build brand awareness in foreign markets 
we have released foreign language versions of our hbx service to facilitate use in certain foreign markets 
although we have not entered into any agreement or understanding for an international acquisition  we have evaluated international acquisition opportunities in the past and will continue to do so in the future 
sources of revenues we currently derive substantially all of our revenues from fees associated with our subscription services 
the substantial majority of these revenues are generated from our hbx services 
these services are provided by subscription to customers for a fee that is based on the number of websites  page views and transactions monitored by our services 
the terms of our subscription agreements are generally one to three years 
our hbx subscription agreements also typically include professional services  such as consulting  education and implementation services and training 
in addition  we generate revenues from subscriptions to our hitbox professional service  which is focused on providing web analytics to small and medium sized businesses 
we have discontinued offering our web analytics services in exchange for advertising revenue and no longer earn any advertising revenue from our web analytics services 
in future periods  we anticipate consolidated revenue from advertising to increase as a result of our acquisition of avivo and the revenue generated from avivo s free website search services 
however  we do not expect these advertising revenues to increase at the same rate as our subscription revenues in future periods 
as discussed elsewhere in this form k  we merged with visual sciences in february visual sciences develops and markets software  which can collect and incorporate raw data  process such data into business information and present the resulting business information in easy to understand and use graphical reports 
in addition to software licenses  visual sciences sells related maintenance agreements  technical support and training and professional services 
the majority of their revenue is derived from the sale of software license agreements 
the terms of the license agreements are generally perpetual in nature 

table of contents cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues cost of revenues primarily consists of expenses related to running our network infrastructure  including internet connectivity  co location and data storage  depreciation associated with computer equipment  web application development activities  salaries and related expenses for network personnel  allocated overhead and amortization associated with capitalized software 
we allocate overhead such as rent and occupancy charges  employee benefit costs and non network related depreciation expense to all departments based on headcount 
as a result  general overhead expenses are reflected in our cost of revenues and each operating expense category 
cost of revenues also includes professional services provided both on implementation of our software and on an on going basis as we advise our customers how to optimize the use of our products 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses represent our largest operating expense category and consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our sales and marketing staff 
sales and marketing expenses include commissions  travel and entertainment  marketing programs  including advertising  events  corporate communications and other brand building and product marketing expenses  and allocated overhead 
we plan to increase our number of direct sales and marketing personnel to expand our domestic and international sales and marketing activities 
we also plan to sponsor additional marketing events and programs to build brand awareness 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we hire additional sales and marketing personnel and increase our marketing activities 
technology development expenses technology development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for our software engineers and product development and quality assurance personnel  as well as other costs related to the development and enhancement of existing services and allocated overhead 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on enhancing our core technology  as well as improving the usability and accessibility of information within our web analytics subscription services 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase as we further enhance our core technology and services and develop technologies for new service offerings 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and accounting  legal  human resources and management information systems personnel  professional fees  other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to add personnel as we expand our business and incur additional expenses to meet compliance requirements associated with operating as a public company 
stock based compensation expenses stock based compensation expenses result from options and warrants issued to employees and directors in situations where there is an excess of the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee or director must pay to acquire the stock 
these expenses have been significant and are reflected in our consolidated financial results 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r 
as a result  we expect stock based compensation expense to increase and the unearned stock based compensation expense balance to be reflected as a component of additional paid in capital 
we are continuing to finalize our evaluation of the impact that the adoption of this rule will have on our results of operations and we expect that it will result in a material increase in our compensation expense 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the 
table of contents united states of america 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and expense and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to bad debts  depreciation and life of developed software  fixed assets and impairment of intangible and tangible assets 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that  in management s view  are most important in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and include allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for business combinations  impairment of long lived assets and goodwill and income taxes 
our critical accounting policies are disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
those critical accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates are allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers inability to pay us 
we calculate this provision based on our historical experience and for specific customers that  in our opinion  are likely to default on our receivables from them 
in order to identify these customers  we perform ongoing reviews of all customers that have breached their payment terms  as well as those that have filed for bankruptcy or for whom information has become available indicating a significant risk of non recoverability 
in addition  we have experienced significant growth in customers  therefore  we have less payment history to rely on with these customers 
we rely on historical trends of bad debt as a percentage of total revenue and apply these percentages to the accounts receivable associated with new customers and evaluate these customers over time 
to the extent our future collections experience differs from our assumptions based on historical trends and our past experience  the amount of our bad debt and allowance recorded may be different 
accounting for stock based compensation we measure compensation expenses for our employee and director stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee or director must pay to acquire the stock 
stock based compensation is amortized over the related vesting periods using an accelerated method 
prior to our initial public offering on october   we considered internal and external factors to assist in our determination of the fair value of our common stock 
internal factors include the success of our sales efforts  customer retention and overall profitability 
external factors consist of market conditions and comparable public companies 
in addition to considering the factors described above  in connection with preparing our financial statements we obtained an independent valuation as of april  to assist us in setting the fair value of our common stock to determine the amount of stock based compensation expenses to be recorded at specific grant dates  however  we are responsible for all fair values used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we made assumptions and estimates in the preparation of our valuation  including assumptions and estimates related to projected cash flows  discount rates  comparable market value multiples  the value of preferences associated with our preferred stock  the effect that those preferences had on the value of our common stock  and the likelihood at various points in time of certain transactions taking place  such as a public offering  a sale of our company  raising additional private financing or a liquidation 
if we had made different estimates and assumptions our conclusions and the related stock based compensation recorded may have been different 
as of december   we had an aggregate of  of unearned stock based compensation expenses remaining to be amortized in future periods 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r 
as a result  we expect stock based compensation expense to increase and the unearned stock based compensation expense balance to be reflected as a component of additional paid in capital 
we are continuing to finalize our evaluation of the impact that the adoption of this rule will have on our results of operations and we expect that it will result in a material increase in our compensation expenses 

table of contents business combinations when we acquire businesses  we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets and liabilities acquired and identifiable intangible assets based on all information available to management at the time 
any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  especially with respect to intangible assets 
these estimates are based on a combination of information which may include historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies  cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future  the fair value of the underlying asset based on similar circumstances in similar industries  cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset and valuations assigned by valuation specialists using proprietary valuation models 
these estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates 
impairments of long lived assets and goodwill we account for long lived assets  excluding goodwill  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assesses potential impairment to our long lived assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we test goodwill for impairment annually  in the second quarter of each fiscal year  or more frequently if events and circumstances warrant 
income taxes we make estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities  income taxes payable and any valuation allowances 
our estimates related to our current provision for income taxes are based on current tax laws 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws could impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial statements 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future taxable income as well as our use of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
our estimates regarding future profitability may change due to future market and industry conditions  changes in tax laws and other factors 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income  changes in tax laws and ongoing prudent and feasible profits 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our net deferred tax assets will not be realized  we establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish or change a valuation allowance in a period  we reflect the change with a corresponding increase or decrease to our tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents our selected consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues subscriptions advertising total revenues cost of revenues cost of revenue amortization of intangibles stock based compensation total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing technology development general and administrative amortization of intangibles stock based compensation total operating expenses income loss from operations interest expense interest income other expense income loss before benefit from income taxes benefit from income taxes net income loss constructive dividend on redemption of redeemable preferred stock accretion of discount on redeemable preferred stock net income loss attributable to common stockholders years ended december  and revenues total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  subscription revenues 
subscription revenues increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  the increase in subscription revenues over the previous year was primarily the result of increasing the number of new customers for our services to over  as of december  from approximately as of december   which resulted from expanding our sales staff and increasing our product breadth and reach 
the inclusion of subscription revenue from avivo  which was acquired in may  also contributed to the increase 
deferred revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  slightly offsetting the increase in revenue was the negative foreign currency translation impact due to an approximate decline of the us dollar in relation to the euro 

table of contents advertising revenues 
advertising revenues increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   from  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  this increase was due to the acquisition of avivo and the inclusion of its advertising revenue beginning may  cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  this increase primarily resulted from an overall increase in headcount  a million increase in salaries  a  increase in consulting work  a  increase in bonuses and employee related costs associated with the expansion of our professional services department and an increase in costs associated with network personnel 
in addition  we incurred higher utility costs and depreciation expense 
cost of revenue also increased as a result of the avivo acquisition 
specifically  we recognized  in amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of avivo 
cost of revenue may continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in future periods because the professional services required to support implementation for our search and content solutions is higher than for hbx 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  this million increase was primarily attributable to increased salaries and wages and related employee benefits for additional sales and marketing personnel of million and increased sales commissions and bonuses of million related to increased revenue 
the increase in sales and marketing personnel and number of customers contributed to higher travel  lodging  communication and employee event costs in the amount of approximately  additionally  we also incurred higher marketing costs specifically related to our product user forum held in november the acquisition of avivo also added to the increase 
specifically  we recognized million in amortization of customer related intangibles associated with the acquisition of avivo 
as our customer base grows and our company expands  we will continue to hire additional sales and customer support personnel in future periods 
technology development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  this  increase was primarily the result of higher salaries and wages and related employee benefit costs of million and higher depreciation expense partially offset by the capitalization of million of internally developed new product software in this compares to  of internally developed new product software costs capitalized during we expect that technology development expenses will continue to increase in future periods as we add engineering resources and commence amortization of newly capitalized internally developed product software 
additionally  we expect that the amount of new software development costs capitalized will decrease in future quarters as we launch our new keyword bid management solution  which is expected to occur later in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  this million increase was largely due to additional professional fees for accounting and legal services of million associated with being a public company  including the costs we incurred in associated with our sarbanes oxley compliance project  an overall increase of million in salaries and wages and an increase in certain insurance coverage 
the acquisition of avivo also added to the increase 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we add headcount and incur additional accounting and legal costs related to operating as a public company  including the costs associated with sustaining sarbanes oxley compliance and additional costs associated with integrating acquired companies 

table of contents stock based compensation expenses stock based compensation expenses increased to  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  in and in prior periods  we measured compensation expense using the intrinsic value method 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options was measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
total unamortized stock based compensation was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r 
as a result  we expect stock based compensation expense to increase and the unearned stock based compensation expense balance to be reflected as a component of additional paid in capital 
we are continuing to finalize our evaluation of the impact that the adoption of this rule will have on our results of operations and we expect that it will result in a material increase in our compensation expenses 
other income  net other income  net  increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was driven by an increase in net interest income earned on proceeds from our initial public offering in october as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  million in long term investments  and million in working capital  as compared to million of cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  million in long term investments and million in working capital as of december  benefit from income taxes the benefit from income taxes of million for the year ended december  primarily resulted from the release of the valuation allowance we had recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax assets relate to our accumulated net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result of the acquisition of avivo and prior ownership changes  these net deferred tax assets will be limited in use on an annual basis pursuant to internal revenue code section as we believe it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will ultimately be recovered  we released our valuation allowance in years ended december  and revenues total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  subscription revenues 
subscription revenues increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  the increase in subscription revenues over the previous year was primarily the result of increasing the number of new customers for our services  which resulted from our decision to increase the number of direct sales personnel 
a renewed focus on customer service that resulted in lower customer attrition  higher retention rates and increased use of our services by existing customers also contributed to the increase in subscription revenues 
deferred revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  deferred revenues reflect invoices rendered or cash received on subscription agreements for which revenues have not yet been recognized 
advertising revenues 
advertising revenues declined to  or of total revenues  for the year ended december   from  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  this decrease was due to our decision to stop providing our free web analytics service that generated advertising revenues 

table of contents cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  this increase primarily resulted from the addition of personnel in our professional services group  who provide advanced training and optimization services for hbx customers 
our professional services cost increased to  in from  in our cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  declined as we reduced the costs of running our data center 
some of these costs include bandwidth  which declined  data center rent  which declined  and depreciation  which declined  resulting from the lower market price of servers and increased server capacity 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  this was primarily attributable to salaries for additional sales and marketing personnel and increased sales commissions related to increased revenues and customers 
salaries and wages increased  travel and entertainment increased  and bonus and commissions increased  technology development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of increased salary expense of  and other costs associated with the development of our hbx service 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to  of expense in connection with the amendment of a sublease at our corporate facility in october as well as a severance payment of  related to the departure of our former chief executive officer and a one time signing bonus of  related to the hiring of our new chief executive officer paid in a reduction in our bad debt expense was partially associated with the release of  of the valuation allowance placed on customer receivables that were subsequently collected during the fourth quarter of our recurring general and administrative costs increased during  the result of additional costs associated with our operation as a public company  which included hiring a chief financial officer  and additional costs for directors and officers insurance  accounting fees and legal fees

in comparison  stock based compensation expenses for the year ended december  included million for the warrant and restricted stock grants to our chief executive officer and former general counsel and  associated with a modification of a stock option of our former chief executive officer that required us to record stock based compensation expense for the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of the stock at the time the former chief executive officer s option was amended 
the option was amended to extend the amount of time that the former chief executive officer was allowed to exercise the option following his departure from the company 
other income  net other income  net  decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the payment of a one time license fee in that was recorded in other income  which resulted in  in other income being recorded in the fourth quarter of other income for the year ended december  and included net interest income of  and  respectively 
the increase in net interest income in was due to the repayment of our borrowings on a line of credit in july and the interest earned on our cash balances  which increased substantially after the completion of our initial public offering at the beginning of october 
table of contents provision for benefit from income taxes the provision for income taxes of  for the year ended december  primarily related to current taxes associated with our foreign operations and alternative minimum tax associated with our united states operations offset by a benefit resulting from the establishment of our foreign deferred assets 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and state operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in  if not realized 
a change in control occurred in connection with our october initial public offering under the provisions of section of the internal revenue code  which will limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be used annually in the future to offset taxable income 
however  based on the annual limitation available and projected taxable income  it is not expected that the change in ownership will impact our cash tax payments 
as of december   we had a full valuation allowance placed on our deferred tax assets due to our relatively short history of profitability 
this valuation allowance will be evaluated each reporting period to determine whether these deferred tax assets are more likely then not to be utilized in the near future 
net operating losses at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which are available to offset future taxable income 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in in  net deferred tax assets  before valuation allowance  increased approximately million primarily due to the recognition of approximately million of net deferred tax assets in connection with the acquisition of avivo during may avivo s net deferred tax assets primarily represent net operating loss carryforwards that will be limited in use on an annual basis pursuant to section our net deferred tax assets also consist of accumulated net operating losses which are also subject to section limitations as a result of prior ownership changes 
the combined deferred tax assets represent the amounts expected to be realized before expiration 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible profits 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence  both positive and negative  we believe it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will ultimately be recovered and  accordingly  released the valuation allowance in the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources overview as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  million in long term investments  and million in working capital  as compared to million of cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  million in long term investments and million in working capital as of december  as described below  in february we used million of our cash to pay a portion of the purchase price in connection with our acquisition of visual sciences 
also in connection with that acquisition  we issued 
table of contents million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
the senior notes mature on august  the senior notes accrue cash pay interest at a rate of per annum  payable at maturity or on certain earlier repayment or prepayment dates 
the senior notes are subject to mandatory repayment  on demand  at any time after april  or upon certain underwritten public offerings of our common stock and must be repaid if we incur indebtedness that ranks senior or pari passu with the priority of payment attributable to the indebtedness represented by the senior notes  subject to certain permitted indebtedness 
we have the right to prepay the senior notes at any time without premium or penalty 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments  combined with our positive cash flow from operating activities  are our principal sources of liquidity 
we will likely need to raise additional debt or equity capital which  together with the cash we expect to generate from operating activities  would then allow us to pay off the million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes commencing in april other than the additional capital required to satisfy the senior notes  we believe our cash balances and the cash flows generated by operating activities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
visual sciences acquisition 
on february   we acquired visual sciences in exchange for million in cash   shares of our common stock  warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock  which expire on august  and have an exercise price of per share  and million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
in connection with the transaction  we also granted  pursuant to our existing equity incentive plan   shares of restricted common stock to certain employees of visual sciences  which vest on january   and non qualified stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock to certain employees of visual sciences 
please see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for further details regarding our acquisition of visual sciences 
avivo acquisition 
on may   we completed the acquisition of avivo  a provider of on demand website search and content solutions 
we paid approximately million in cash  and issued  shares of common stock and options to purchase  shares of common stock  to acquire avivo 
approximately million of the million total cash consideration and approximately  of the  shares of common stock have been deposited in escrow to secure indemnification obligations of avivo and possible adjustments to the purchase price 
initial public offering of common stock 
on october   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at an initial offering price to the public of per share  resulting in million of gross proceeds to the company 
after deducting the underwriting discount of million and offering expenses of million  our net proceeds from the initial public offering were million 
on october   in connection with the full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option   additional shares of common stock were sold to the public on behalf of certain selling stockholders at a price of per share 
we did not receive any of the million in gross proceeds from the sale of these additional shares by the selling stockholders 
we used million of our net proceeds from the initial public offering to redeem all of our outstanding redeemable preferred stock 
we used the remaining proceeds from our initial public offering to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of visual sciences described above 
cash flows in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net change in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of million in net income and changes in working capital  including a million increase in deferred revenues related to our increased customer base and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due primarily to increased fees from our independent public auditors 
non cash adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities included add backs of million and million for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation  respectively 
those increases to net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable which compares to our increase in deferred revenue  a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets and a million increase in deferred tax assets 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of a million increase in deferred revenues  an  increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and the add back of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of million and  respectively

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
net cash provided by operating activities consisted primarily of a million increase in deferred revenues and a  increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and the add back of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation of million and million  respectively 
this was also offset  to a lesser extent than  by an increase in accounts receivable 
investing activities net cash provided from investment activities totaled million for the year ended december  net cash provided from investment activities is attributable to the maturity of investments  partially offset by capital expenditures of million and the million of net cash used in the acquisition of avivo 
cash used in investing activities totaled million for the year ended december  this included million for capital expenditures and a net cash outflow of million for the purchase of marketable securities 
cash used in investing activities totaled  for the year ended december   which consisted entirely of capital expenditures 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities was  in the year ended december  the exercise of stock options of  partially offset by payments on capital leases and a note contributed to this amount 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  this consisted of million in net proceeds from our initial public offering offset by the million redemption of our redeemable preferred stock 
the exercise of stock options and warrants also contributed cash during cash used for financing during was  the majority of this was attributable to the repayment of our line of credit 
factors that may affect future financial condition and liquidity our principal commitments consist of our million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due not later than august   and our obligations under operating leases for office space  computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 
our capital lease obligations for furniture and computer equipment are approximately  in the 
table of contents aggregate with the longest term expiring in as these capital lease amounts are relatively small  they do not materially affect our overall liquidity 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations  net of sublease income  as of december   and does not reflect our million of senior notes which were issued in february payments due by period more less than than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands capital lease obligations operating lease obligations we anticipate that our future capital uses and requirements will depend on a variety of factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the costs of serving more customers  the costs of our network infrastructure  the costs of our research and development activities to improve our service offerings  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other technologies and businesses 
other than the additional capital required to satisfy our senior note obligations  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  combined with our positive cash flow from operating activities  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we believe that we will have access to sufficient liquidity to fund our business and meet our senior note and contractual lease obligations over a period beyond the next months 
however  we will likely need to raise additional debt or equity capital prior to april to help us satisfy our senior note obligations  and we may need to raise additional funds in the future if we pursue acquisitions or investments in competing or complementary businesses or technologies or experience unanticipated operating losses 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and for all periods presented  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
other than our operating leases for office space and computer equipment  which are described above  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
therefore  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro 
we analyze our exposure to currency fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to reduce the effect of these potential fluctuations 
we have not entered into any hedging contracts to date since exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results and cash flows 
the majority of our subscription agreements are denominated in us dollars 
to date  our foreign 
table of contents revenues have been primarily in euros 
we generated approximately  and of total revenues from customers in europe for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds 
the unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income
