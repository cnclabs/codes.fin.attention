item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with part i  including the matters set forth in the risk factors section of this form k  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview during  as throughout our eight year history  we grew our business primarily through acquisitions 
we typically seek to acquire large  profitable  well established and well managed dealerships that are leaders in their respective market areas 
over the past five years  we have acquired dealership franchises with annual revenues of approximately billion  disposed of dealership franchises with annual revenues of approximately million  and been granted eight new dealership franchises by the manufacturers 
each acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and is included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in the following discussion and analysis  we report certain performance measures of our newly acquired dealerships separately from those of our existing dealerships 
our operating results reflect the combined performance of each of our interrelated business activities  which include the sale of new vehicles  used vehicles  finance and insurance products  and parts  service and collision repair services 
historically  each of these activities has been directly or indirectly impacted by a variety of supply demand factors  including vehicle inventories  consumer confidence  discretionary spending  availability and affordability of consumer credit  manufacturer incentives  weather patterns  fuel prices and interest rates 
for example  during periods of sustained economic downturn or significant supply demand imbalances  new vehicle sales may be negatively impacted as consumers tend to shift their purchases to used vehicles 
some consumers may even delay their purchasing decisions altogether  electing instead to repair their existing vehicles 
in such cases  however  we believe the impact on our overall business is mitigated by our ability to offer other products and services  such as used vehicles and parts  service and collision repair services 
for the years ended december   and  we realized net income of million  million and million  respectively  and diluted earnings per share of  and  respectively 
the following factors impacted our financial condition and results of operations in  and  and may cause our reported financial data not to be indicative of our future financial condition and operating results 
year ended december  hurricanes katrina and rita on august   hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast of the united states  including new orleans  louisiana 
at that time  we operated six dealerships in the new orleans area consisting of nine franchises 
two of the dealerships are located in the heavily flooded east bank of new orleans and nearby metairie areas  while the other four are located on the west bank of new orleans  where flood related damage was less severe 
the east bank stores suffered significant damage and loss of business and remain closed  although our dodge store in metairie has resumed limited operations from a satellite location 
the west bank stores reopened approximately two weeks after the storm 
on september   hurricane rita came ashore along the texas louisiana border  near houston and beaumont  texas 
the company operates two dealerships in beaumont  texas  consisting of eleven franchises and nine dealerships in the houston area consisting of seven franchises 
as a result of the evacuation by many residents of houston  and the aftermath of the storm in beaumont  all of these dealerships were closed several days before and after the storm 
all of these dealerships have since resumed normal operations 
based on preliminary estimates of the damage sustained at our new orleans area and beaumont dealership facilities and our inventory of new and used vehicles at those locations  we have estimated the total loss for such damage to be approximately million 
after we applied the terms of our underlying property and casualty insurance policies  we recorded an insurance recovery receivable totaling million and reduced the above noted estimated loss to million 
this loss is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the receivable was established based on our determination  given our experience with these type claims and discussions to date with our insurance carriers  that it is probable that recovery will occur for the amount of these losses and the cost to repair our leased facilities in excess of insurance policy deductibles 
we made the determination of whether recovery was probable in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which defines probable as being likely to occur 
during the fourth quarter  we received total payments on these receivables of million 
we maintain business interruption insurance coverage under which our insurance providers have advanced a total of million  however  this amount is subject to final audit under the policies and also subject to settlement adjustments 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded approximately million of these proceeds  related to covered payroll and fixed cost expenditures since august   as a reduction to the above noted loss accrual 
although we believe we may be eligible for greater amounts of recovery for loss of operations at all of our new orleans area and beaumont dealerships  we are at this time unable to determine either the amount of  or nature of  additional covered items with any certainty 
we have  therefore  not recorded any additional portion of these proceeds as a reduction of our loss for the period 
any part of these proceeds that we retain  and any additional recoveries under this coverage  will be recognized in the period in which all contingencies have been resolved 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for some of our dealerships  our adoption of eitf d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  resulted in intangible franchise rights having carrying values that were in excess of their fair values 
this required us to write off the excess value of million  net of deferred taxes of million  or per diluted share  as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of asset impairments in connection with the preparation and review of our third quarter interim financial statements  we determined that recent events and circumstances in new orleans indicated that an impairment of goodwill  intangible franchise rights and or other long lived assets may have occurred in the three months ended september  therefore  we performed interim impairment assessments of these assets 
as a result of these assessments  we determined that the carrying value of the intangible franchise right associated with our dodge franchise in new orleans was impaired and recorded a pretax charge of million during the third quarter of due to the then pending disposals of two of our california franchises  a kia and a nissan franchise  we tested the respective asset groups for impairment during the third quarter of these tests resulted in impairments of long lived assets totaling million 
as required by sfas no 
 we performed an annual review of the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  as a result of this assessment  we determined that the fair value of indefinite lived intangible franchise rights related to three of our franchises  primarily a pontiac gmc franchise in the south central region  did not exceed their carrying value and impairment charges were required 
accordingly  we recorded a million pretax impairment charge during the fourth quarter of year ended december  impairment of goodwill and long lived assets as a result of the further deterioration of our atlanta platform s financial results  we concluded that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value as of september  accordingly  in the third quarter of  we recorded a total pretax charge of million related to the impairment of the carrying value of its goodwill and certain long lived assets 
loss on redemption of senior subordinated notes in march  we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding senior subordinated notes and incurred a million pretax charge 
impairment of indefinite lived intangible asset during our annual assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in connection with our year end financial statement preparation process  we determined that the carrying value of one of our mitsubishi franchises in the california region was in excess of its fair market value 
accordingly  we recorded a pretax charge of million 
year ended december  resolution of tax contingencies during  we recognized a million reduction  or per diluted share  in our estimated tax liabilities as a result of the favorable resolution of tax contingencies at the conclusion of various state and federal tax audits 
these items  and other variances between the periods presented  are covered in the following discussion 
key performance indicators the following table highlights certain of the key performance indicators we use to manage our business consolidated statistical data for the year ended december  unit sales retail sales new vehicle used vehicle total retail sales wholesale sales total vehicle sales gross margin new vehicle retail sales adjusted used vehicle total parts and service sales total gross margin sg a as a of gross profit operating margin pretax margin finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold we monitor a statistic we call adjusted used vehicle gross margin which equals total used vehicle gross profit  which includes the total net profit or loss from the wholesale sale of used vehicles  divided by retail used vehicle sales revenues 
the net profit or loss on wholesale used vehicle sales are included in this number  as these transactions facilitate retail used vehicle sales and management of inventory levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
since  our retail unit sales have increased as a result of acquisitions  as same store new vehicle unit sales were relatively flat and same store retail unit sales of used vehicles decreased from to and an additional from to over the past three years  our new vehicle gross margin has declined from for the twelve months ended december   to for both and at the same time  however  our consolidated gross profit per new retail unit sold has risen from  per unit in  to  per unit in and  per unit in during  while same store gross profit per retail unit sold was only up slightly  we saw a strong contribution from the full year impact of franchises  primarily luxury and import  acquired in our used vehicle results are directly affected by the level of manufacturer incentives on new vehicles  the number and quality of trade ins and lease turn ins and the availability of consumer credit 
over the last three years  we have seen a decline in same store retail sales of used vehicle units  offset by the benefit received from acquisitions 
during this same time period  however  we have seen pricing begin to stabilize and we have more aggressively wholesaled marginal vehicles 
as a result  our adjusted used vehicle total margin has increased from in and to in our consolidated parts and service gross margin decreased to in  from in and in  as a result of an increase in contribution from our parts business in relation to our service business 
since our parts business has lower gross margins than our service business  this change in mix has caused our overall parts and service gross margin to decline 
however  gross profit did rise from to and from to  on a same store basis  as our overall level of activity has increased 
our finance and insurance revenues decreased from  per retail unit sold in to in  with a partial recovery in to per unit  reflecting a decline in penetration rates of finance and insurance products for new and used vehicle sales and the dilutive effect of acquisitions  as their finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold were significantly below our average 
during  our selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  as a percentage of gross profit  decreased from during  to in this decrease came primarily from reductions in advertising costs 
from to  our sg a increased as a percentage of gross profit from to 
this increase resulted primarily from increases in same store  non variable costs 
for both comparative periods  our same store personnel related items generally varied with changes in our gross profit 
acquisitions had a negative effect on our overall average for both comparative periods  as their sg a levels were higher than our same store average 
the combination of the above factors  together with the reduction in the level of impairment charges recorded in  as compared to  partially offset by an increase in our floorplan interest expense  contributed to a net increase in our operating margin to  from in  and in our pretax margin to  from in our floorplan interest expense increased primarily as a result of rising interest rates 
for  as compared to  the above noted variances  together with the impairment charges and increases in floorplan and other interest expense  caused the declines in our operating margin to from in  and in our pretax margin to from in a factor that will impact our financial performance in is the adoption of a new accounting standard 
specifically  in accordance with sfas r  share based payment  which was issued by the financial accounting standards board in december as a result  we will begin recognizing compensation expense related to stock option and employee stock purchase plan grants in our statement of operations during the first quarter of we expect such expense to total approximately million in the twelve months ended december  we believe that our future success depends  among other things  on our ability to successfully acquire and integrate new dealerships  while at the same time achieving optimum performance from our diverse franchise mix  attracting and retaining high caliber employees and reinvesting as needed to maintain top quality facilities 
during  we expect to spend approximately million to construct new facilities and upgrade or expand existing facilities  although we expect to sell and lease back facilities accounting for approximately million of these expenditures  resulting in net expenditures of million 
in addition  we expect to complete acquisitions of dealerships with at least million in expected aggregate annual revenues 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies we use and the estimates and assumptions we make during their preparation 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates 
critical accounting policies we have identified below what we believe to be the most pervasive accounting policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of all our significant accounting policies 
inventories 
we carry our new  used and demonstrator vehicle inventories  as well as our parts and accessories inventories  at the lower of cost or market in our consolidated balance sheets 
vehicle inventory cost consists of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  plus reconditioning cost  cost of equipment added and transportation 
additionally  we receive interest assistance from some of our manufacturers 
this assistance is accounted for as a vehicle purchase price discount and is reflected as a reduction to the inventory cost on our balance sheets and as a reduction to cost of sales in our statements of operation as the vehicles are sold 
as the market value of our inventory typically declines over time  we establish reserves based on our historical loss experience and market trends 
these reserves are charged to cost of sales and reduce the carrying value of our inventory on hand 
used vehicles are complex to value as there is no standardized source for determining exact values and each vehicle and each market in which we operate is unique 
as a result  the value of each used vehicle taken at trade in  or purchased at auction  is subjectively determined based on the industry expertise of the responsible used vehicle manager 
our valuation risk is mitigated  somewhat  by how quickly we turn this inventory 
at december   our used vehicle days supply was days 
retail finance  insurance and vehicle service contract revenues recognition 
we arrange financing for customers through various institutions and receive financing fees based on the difference between the loan rates charged to customers and predetermined financing rates set by the financing institution 
in addition  we receive fees from the sale of insurance and vehicle service contracts to customers 
we may be charged back for unearned financing  insurance contract or vehicle service contract fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
revenues from these fees are recorded at the time of the sale of the vehicles and a reserve for future amounts which might be charged back is established based on our historical chargeback results and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
while our chargeback results vary depending on the type of contract sold  a change in the historical chargeback results used in determining our estimates of future amounts which might be charged back would have changed our reserve at december   by approximately million 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principals requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess  at the date of acquisition  of the purchase price of businesses acquired over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 business combinations 
prior to our adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded purchase prices in excess of the net tangible assets acquired as goodwill and did not separately record any intangible assets apart from goodwill as all were amortized over similar lives 
during  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changed the treatment of goodwill to no longer permit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require goodwill and intangible assets  of which franchise rights are our most significant  to be recorded separately  and require  at least annually  an assessment for impairment of goodwill by reporting unit using a fair value based  two step test 
we perform the annual impairment assessment at the end of each calendar year  or more frequently if events or circumstances at a reporting unit occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
based on the organization and management of our business during  we determined that each of our groups of dealerships formerly referred to as platforms qualified as reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill for impairment 
however  with our reorganization into five regions  effective january   we anticipate that changes in our management  operational and reporting structure and additional changes to be made during  will ultimately lead us to the determination that goodwill will be evaluated at a regional level in the future 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use a discounted cash flow approach 
included in this analysis are assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  future gross margins  future selling  general and administrative expenses and an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
we also must estimate residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements 
each of these assumptions requires us to use our knowledge of our industry  our recent transactions and reasonable performance expectations for our operations 
if any one of the above assumptions change  in some cases insignificantly  or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in our estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the goodwill associated with the reporting unit s  especially with respect to those operations acquired prior to july  intangible franchise rights 
our only significant identifiable intangible assets  other than goodwill  are rights under our franchise agreements with manufacturers 
we expect these franchise agreements to continue for an indefinite period but  when these agreements do not have indefinite terms  we believe that renewal of these agreements can be obtained without substantial cost 
as such  we believe that our franchise agreements will contribute to cash flows for an indefinite period 
therefore  we do not amortize the carrying amount of our franchise rights 
franchise rights acquired in acquisitions prior to july   were not separately recorded  but were recorded and amortized as part of goodwill and remain a part of goodwill at december  and  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
like goodwill  and in accordance with sfas no 
 we test our franchise rights for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment  using a fair value method 
at the september meeting of the emerging issues task force eitf  the sec staff issued staff announcement no 
d  use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill  which states that for business combinations after september   the residual method should no longer be used to value intangible assets other than goodwill 
rather  a direct value method should be used to determine the fair value of all intangible assets other than goodwill required to be recognized under sfas no 
 business combinations 
additionally  registrants who have applied a residual method to the valuation of intangible assets for purposes of impairment testing under sfas no 
 shall perform an impairment test using a direct value method on all intangible assets that were previously valued using a residual method by no later than the beginning of their first fiscal year beginning after december  to test the carrying value of each individual franchise right for impairment under eitf d  we use a discounted cash flow based approach 
included in this analysis are assumptions  at a dealership level  regarding the cash flows directly attributable to the franchise right  revenue growth rates  future gross margins and future selling  general and administrative expenses 
using an estimated weighted average cost of capital  estimated residual values at the end of the forecast period and future capital expenditure requirements  we calculate the fair value of each dealership s franchise rights after considering estimated values for tangible assets  working capital and workforce 
for some of our dealerships  the adoption of the annual impairment provisions as of january   resulted in a fair value that was less than the carrying value of their intangible franchise rights 
as a result  a non cash charge of million  net of deferred taxes of million  was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with the transitional rules of eitf d in the first quarter of if any one of the above assumptions change  including in some cases insignificantly  or fails to materialize  the resulting decline in our intangible franchise rights estimated fair value could result in a material impairment charge to the intangible franchise right associated with the applicable dealership 
for example  if our assumptions regarding the future interest rates used in our estimated weighted average cost of capital change by basis points  and all other assumptions remain constant  the resulting non cash charge would be approximately million 
self insured property and casualty reserves 
we are self insured for a portion of the claims related to our property and casualty insurance programs  requiring us to make estimates regarding expected claims to be incurred 
as a result of recent significant increases in the self insured portion of our worker s compensation and general liability insurance programs  we engaged a third party actuary to conduct a study of these exposures for all open policy years 
based on the results of this study  we recorded a million reduction to our estimated workers compensation and general liability accruals during the third quarter of we intend to obtain an updated actuarial study on an annual basis and will make the appropriate adjustments to our accrual accordingly 
actuarial estimates for the portion of claims not covered by insurance are based on our historical claims experience adjusted for loss trending and loss development factors 
changes in the frequency or severity of claims from historical levels could influence our reserve for claims and our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
a change in the historical loss history used in determining our estimate of future losses would have changed our reserve for these losses at december   by million 
for workers compensation and general liability insurance policy years ended prior to october   this component of our insurance program included aggregate retention stop loss limits in addition to a per claim deductible limit 
due to our historical experience in both claims frequency and severity  the likelihood of breaching the aggregate retention limits described above was deemed remote  and as such  we elected not to purchase this stop loss coverage for the policy year beginning november  our exposure per claim under this plan is limited to million per occurrence  with unlimited exposure on the number of claims up to million that we may incur 
our maximum potential exposure under all of our self insured property and casualty plans with aggregate retention limits originally totaled million  before consideration of amounts previously paid or accruals we have recorded related to our loss projections 
after consideration of these amounts  our remaining potential loss exposure under these plans totals approximately million at december  fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we estimate the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  which involves the use of various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions  and those requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of property and equipment and intangible franchise rights  with the remaining attributable to goodwill  if any 
results of operations the same store amounts presented below include the results of dealerships for the identical months in each period presented in the comparison  commencing with the first full month in which the dealership was owned by us and  in the case of dispositions  ending with the last full month it was owned by us 
same store results also include the activities of the corporate office 
for example  for a dealership acquired in june  the results from this dealership will appear in our same store comparison beginning in  for the period july through december  when comparing to july through december results 
the following table summarizes our combined same store results for the twelve months ended december  as compared to and the twelve months ended december  compared to you should note that depending on the periods being compared  the stores included in same store will vary

our new vehicle unit sales  revenues and gross profit for the year ended december   outpaced due primarily to the current year contribution of our acquisitions completed throughout these gains were slightly offset by same store declines in each area 
for the year ended december   as compared to  we also saw increases in new vehicle unit sales  revenues and gross profit due to the acquisitions completed during although same store unit sales increased in from  our same store average gross profit per retail unit sold decreased  resulting in lower gross profit 
we believe this decrease was largely due to high industry wide inventory levels and intense competition 
during  as compared to  we saw same store gross profit per unit rebound slightly  to an average of  per unit  which helped to mitigate the effect of lower sales volume 
the following table sets forth our top ten same store brands  based on retail unit sales volume  the changes in which year to year we believe are consistent with the overall market in those areas we operate same store new vehicle unit sales for the year ended december  change change toyota scion ford nissan honda chevrolet dodge lexus chrysler jeep mercedes benz other total in general  our variances between each comparable period above were consistent with the overall trend in retail new vehicle sales throughout the industry 
however  due to competitive pressures  including new entrants into some of the markets in which our stores operate  our decreases in dodge and nissan unit sales were greater than industry average  when comparing to for as compared to  our decreases in ford and honda unit sales were greater than industry average 
highlighting the cyclical nature of our business  our increases in chrysler units during outpaced industry averages and our increases in chrysler  dodge and jeep in  as compared to  exceeded the overall marketplace as well  thus highlighting the need to have a well balanced portfolio of new vehicle brands of which we sell 
in  we anticipate that total industry wide sales of new vehicles will be comparable to and remain highly competitive 
however  the level of retail sales  as well as our own ability to retain or grow market share  during future periods is difficult to predict 
most manufacturers offer interest assistance to offset floorplan interest charges incurred in connection with inventory purchases 
this assistance varies by manufacturer  but generally provides for a defined amount regardless of our actual floorplan interest rate or the length of time for which the inventory is financed 
the amount of interest assistance we recognize in a given period is primarily a function of the specific terms of the respective manufacturers interest assistance programs and wholesale interest rates  the average wholesale price of inventory sold  and our rate of inventory turn 
for these reasons  this assistance has ranged from approximately to of our total floorplan interest expense over the past three years 
we record these incentives as a reduction of new vehicle cost of sales as the vehicles are sold  which therefore impact the gross profit and gross margin detailed above 
the total assistance recognized in cost of goods sold during the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
finally  our days supply of new vehicle inventory continues to decrease  from days supply at december   to days supply at december   and days supply at december  our days supply at december   was heavily weighted toward our domestic inventory  which stood at days supply  versus our import and luxury brands in which we had a days and days supply  respectively 
we remain focused on reducing our days supply of domestic vehicles 
with respect to import and luxury brand vehicles  given the quick turn of these units which are often in high demand and low supply  we would like to increase our supply to facilitate higher overall unit sales  but we are dependent on the allocation allotments set by the applicable manufacturer

adjusted used gross profit per retail unit sold equals total used vehicle gross profit  which includes net wholesale profit or loss  divided by retail unit sales 
the net profit or loss on wholesale vehicle sales is included in this number  as these transactions facilitate retail vehicle sales and management of inventory levels 
adjusted used gross margin equals total gross profit  which includes net wholesale profit or loss  divided by retail sales revenues 
the net profit or loss on wholesale vehicle sales is included in this number  as these transactions facilitate retail vehicle sales and management of inventory levels 
at times  including during each of the last three years  manufacturer incentives such as significant rebates and below market retail financing rates on new vehicles  have resulted in a reduction of the price difference to the customer between a late model used vehicle and a new vehicle  resulting in more customers purchasing new vehicles 
over the same time period  we have experienced declines in our same store used vehicle sales volume 
the impact of these declines in volume was partially offset by increases in both the average gross profit from retail sales of used vehicles as well as overall increases in total gross profit per retail unit sold including the impact on total used vehicle gross profit from the losses incurred on wholesale vehicle transactions 
for the twelve months ended december   compared to  our same store locations sold fewer retail used vehicles  but realized higher average gross profit per retail unit sold 
for the twelve months ended december   compared to  our same store locations sold fewer retail used vehicles  but realized higher average gross profit per retail unit sold 
because of the overall softness in used vehicle unit sales  we have been focused on acquiring and retaining inventory of those units which are most likely to be sold to retail customers and which are expected to yield the highest gross profit 
this  in turn  contributed to the reduction in wholesale loss per wholesale unit sold from to  which when taken together yielded the increase in adjusted used gross profit per retail unit sold 
the dealerships we acquired during and  although yielding a lower used vehicle retail gross margin than our same stores  realized a higher average gross profit per retail vehicle sold than our same stores 
we believe both of these factors result from the impact of luxury dealerships acquired  whose used vehicle businesses typically have higher retail sales prices and higher gross profit per unit 
finally  our days supply of used vehicle inventory has continued to decrease  from days supply at december   to days supply at december   and days supply at december  as with new vehicles  although we continuously work to optimize our used vehicle inventory levels  the days supply at december   was unusually low and  in all likelihood  will need to be increased in the coming months to provide adequate supply and selection for the spring and summer selling seasons 
we target a days supply for maximum operating efficiency 
parts and service data dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change change parts and service revenues same stores transactions total gross profit same stores transactions total gross margin same stores transactions total our same store parts and service revenues increased and gross profit increased for the year ended december  versus for  when comparing to  we had increases in same store revenues of and gross profit of 
these increases were primarily driven by improvements in our parts businesses  as well as our customer pay non warranty service business during our same store parts sales increased million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to these increases were driven by a increase in retail sales and an increase in our lower margin wholesale sales 
for the year ended december   when comparing to  the increases were fueled by a increase in retail sales  a increase in warranty related parts sales and an increase in wholesale parts sales  which again yield a lower margin 
despite increases in same store gross profit in both periods  this change in sales mix led to slight declines in our overall parts gross margin as our individual retail and wholesale parts margins were relatively constant between the periods 
our same store service business during also saw improvements in both revenues and gross profit 
for this year  as compared to  our service revenue increased  while our gross profit increased 
these relative improvements were driven primarily by increases in customer pay  non warranty work resulting from various facility expansion projects and focused marketing activities in several of our regions

total average finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold improved during the year  despite the addition of our recent acquisitions  which generally had lower penetration of finance and insurance products on sales of new vehicles than our existing stores 
we expect the sale of these products to increase over time as these newly acquired operations benefit from our standardized  menu driven selling process 
the impact of dealerships acquired in  along with lower same store penetration of products on both new and used vehicles  also caused our finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold to decrease in  as compared to with respect to same store retail finance fees  during  as compared to  we saw a decrease in fee income on a decline in total retail vehicle sales 
this decrease  was due to a decline in penetration rates as the manufacturers shifted their incentives from zero percent financing to employee pricing and customers became more selective in their financing choice 
our same store retail finance fees decreased  as compared to  due to a decrease in unit sales and a decline in penetration on total unit sales 
this decline in penetration was primarily attributable to a decrease in penetration on unit sales of used vehicles as a result of an overall challenging credit market for these vehicles 
with respect to same store vehicle service contract fees  during  as compared to  we experienced a increase in income on the above noted decline in total retail vehicle unit sales 
this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase from higher revenues per contract on new and used vehicle transactions  net of a related increase in chargeback activity  partially offset by a slight decline in penetration of contract sales in used vehicle transactions 
our same store vehicle service contract fees decreased  as compared to  primarily as a result of the decrease in used vehicles sold  as well as a decline in the amount of previously deferred revenue recognized on contracts sold in prior years 
with respect to same store insurance and other sales revenue  the increases during  as compared to  were primarily attributable to revenue associated with the sale of guaranteed asset protection and maintenance insurance products 
the decline in our same store other finance and insurance revenues from million in  to million in  was primarily the result of a reduction in revenue associated with insurance policies and other ancillary products

we believe that our personnel and advertising expenses are variable and can be adjusted in response to changing business conditions 
in such a case  however  it may take us several months to adjust our cost structure  or we may elect not to fully adjust a variable component  such as advertising expenses 
the changes in same store personnel related costs from to  and also from to  are generally consistent with the changes noted in same store gross profit  as the compensation of our commissioned salespeople and local management is closely tied to gross profit 
advertising expense is managed locally and will vary period to period based upon current trends  market factors and other circumstances in each individual market 
throughout  we have continued to closely scrutinize our advertising spending and  as a result  realized a decrease during the year  as compared to  on top of a decrease in as compared to the increase in same store rent and facility costs across the periods presented is primarily due to rent increases associated with new facilities and scheduled rent increases  tied to changes in the consumer price or similar index  on existing facilities 
other sg a consists primarily of insurance  freight  supplies  professional fees  loaner car expenses  vehicle delivery expenses  software licenses and other data processing costs  and miscellaneous other operating costs not related to personnel  advertising or facilities 
during  as compared to  we had a net increase of million primarily attributable to the following a million increase in our reserve for uncollectible accounts  a million increase in delivery related expenses  primarily as a result of higher fuel costs  and a million increase in professional fees  primarily consisting of legal fees and expenses  executive search fees  and board of director fees and expenses 
these items were partially offset by a million decrease in net losses from our property and casualty retained risk program 
during  as compared to  our same store other sg a increased million  primarily as a result of the following we incurred million of higher losses from our property and casualty retained risk program  primarily from two significant events a hailstorm that damaged or destroyed more than  vehicles  or about of the inventory  at our amarillo  texas  dealerships during the second quarter of  and the damage sustained at our florida dealerships from hurricanes during the third quarter of  we had a million increase in professional fees  primarily related to the assessment and testing of our internal control environment in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  during  as a result of favorable collection activity on a portfolio of customer loans we guaranteed in prior years  we realized a million benefit related to the reduction of a previously established required guarantee liability 
during  we further reduced this guarantee liability by million  we had a million increase in vehicle delivery expenses  primarily due to higher fuel costs  and we accrued an estimated million for our expected settlement costs based on the progression of settlement discussions in the class action lawsuit regarding vehicle inventory tax charges to which we are a party in texas 
the remainder is attributable to numerous less significant items which in total increased by approximately million on a net basis  or an increase of as compared to same store other sg a for this increase is  on a percentage basis  approximately the same as our other less variable rent and facility costs 
depreciation and amortization data dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change change same stores transactions total our same store depreciation and amortization expense increased between each period presented primarily as a result of a number of facility additions  including service bay expansions  facility upgrades and manufacturer required image renovations 
results for also include an approximate million charge during the first quarter of  resulting from an adjustment to the depreciable lives of certain of our leasehold improvements to better reflect their remaining useful lives 
impairment of assets in connection with the preparation and review of our third quarter interim financial statements  we determined that recent events and circumstances in new orleans indicated that an impairment of goodwill and or other long lived assets may have occurred in the three months ended september  as a result  we performed interim impairment assessments of certain of our dealerships in the new orleans area  followed by an interim impairment assessment of the goodwill associated with our new orleans operations  in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the period ended september  as a result of these assessments  we recorded a pretax impairment charge of million during the third quarter of relating to the intangible franchise right of our dodge store located in metairie  louisiana  whose carrying value exceeded its fair value 
based on our goodwill assessment  no impairment of the carrying value of the recorded goodwill associated with our new orleans operations had occurred 
our goodwill impairment analysis included an assumption that our business interruption insurance proceeds would allow the operations to maintain a level cash flow rate consistent with past operating performance until those operations return to normal 
we are unable to determine at this time  and therefore have made no assumption regarding  whether a permanent decline in the new orleans business economy has occurred 
such a permanent decline could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could result in the fair value of our new orleans operations not exceeding the carrying value of its respective net assets 
due to the then pending disposal of two of our california franchises  a kia and a nissan franchise  we tested the dealerships for impairment during the third quarter of these tests resulted in impairments of long lived assets totaling million 
as required by sfas no 
 we performed an annual review of the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at december  as a result of this assessment  we determined that the fair value of indefinite lived intangible franchise rights related to three of our franchises  primarily a pontiac gmc franchise in the south central region  did not exceed their carrying values and impairment charges were required 
accordingly  we recorded million of pretax impairment charges during the fourth quarter of during october  in connection with the preparation and review of our third quarter interim financial statements  we determined that recent events and circumstances within our atlanta operations  including further deterioration of its financial results and recent changes in management  indicated that an impairment of goodwill may have occurred in the three months ended september  as a result  we performed an interim impairment assessment of the goodwill associated with our atlanta operations in accordance with sfas no 
after analyzing the long term potential of the atlanta market and the expected pretax income of our dealership franchises in atlanta  we determined that the carrying amount operations exceeded its fair value as of september   and recorded a pretax goodwill impairment charge of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review long lived assets for impairment whenever there is evidence that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
as a result of the factors noted above  we evaluated the long lived assets of the dealerships within our atlanta operations for impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
and recorded a pretax impairment charge for certain leasehold improvements of million at september  during our annual assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as part of our year end financial statement preparation process  we determined that the carrying value of one of our mitsubishi dealership s intangible franchise rights was in excess of its fair market value and recorded a pretax impairment charge of million at december  floorplan interest expense dollars in thousands for the year ended december  change change same stores transactions total memo manufacturer s assistance our floorplan interest expense fluctuates based on changes in borrowings outstanding and interest rates  which are based on libor or prime in some cases plus a spread 
our same store floorplan interest expense increased during the twelve months ended december   compared to  as a result of a basis point increase in weighted average interest rates  partially offset by a million decrease in weighted average borrowings outstanding 
our same store floorplan interest expense increased during the twelve months ended december   compared to  as a result of a million increase in weighted average borrowings outstanding between the periods and a basis point increase in weighted average interest rates 
the increase in weighted average borrowings was primarily a result of the use of the proceeds from our senior subordinated notes offering in august to temporarily pay down our floorplan notes payable 
these funds were partially redrawn in march to fund the redemption of our senior subordinated notes and in june to fund our acquisitions 
also impacting same store floorplan expense between each of the periods were changes attributable to our outstanding interest rate swaps 
during  we had two interest rate swaps outstanding during the year  each with notional amounts of million and converting day libor to a fixed rate 
one of the swaps expired in july and therefore was outstanding for the first seven months of only and the second expired in october and therefore was outstanding for all of and for the first months of only 
during  we had no interest rate swaps in place until december 
as a result of their staggered expiration dates  and the impact on the expense attributable to the swaps resulting from changes in interest rates  our swap expense decreased from million for the twelve months ended december   to million for the twelve months ended december   and an insignificant amount in other interest expense  net other net interest expense  which consists of interest charges on our long term debt and on our acquisition line partially offset by interest income  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to an approximate million decrease in weighted average borrowings outstanding between the periods  as we repaid the remaining balance of our acquisition line during the year 
our weighted average effective interest rates on these net borrowings were comparable between these periods 
for the year ended december   as compared to  other net interest expense increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an approximate million increase in weighted average borrowings outstanding between the periods  partially offset by a basis point decrease in weighted average interest rates 
during  our average debt outstanding increased  as compared to the average for the twelve months ended december   as a result of borrowings under our acquisition line in and the issuance  in august  of million of senior subordinated notes

provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our tax provision was million 
for the twelve months ended december   our effective tax rate decreased to  from for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was positively impacted by adjustments to deferred tax items for certain assets and liabilities 
excluding these items  our effective tax rate would have been 
our effective tax rate was negatively impacted as a result of the non deductibility for tax purposes of certain portions of the goodwill impairment charge we recorded in september related to our atlanta platform  and was positively impacted by certain other adjustments to reconcile differences between the tax and book basis of our assets 
excluding these items  our effective tax would have been approximately finally  our effective tax rate of benefited from a million reduction in our estimated tax liabilities as a result of the favorable resolution of tax contingencies during when various state and federal tax audits were concluded  providing certainty and resolution on various formation  financing  acquisition and structural matters 
in addition  various other tax exposures of acquired companies had been favorably resolved 
excluding these benefits  our effective tax rate would have been

borrowings on our new vehicle floorplan notes payable  subject to agreed upon pay off terms  are equal to of the factory invoice of the vehicles 
borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan notes payable  subject to agreed upon pay off terms  are limited to of the aggregate book value of our used vehicle inventory 
at times  we have made payments on our floorplan notes payable using excess cash flow from operations and the proceeds of debt and equity offerings 
as needed  we reborrow the amounts later  up to the limits on the floorplan notes payable discussed below  for working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures or general corporate purposes 
credit facilities 
our various credit facilities are used to finance the purchase of inventory  provide acquisition funding and provide working capital for general corporate purposes

this facility consists of two tranches million for floorplan financing  which we refer to as the floorplan line  and million for acquisitions  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  including the issuance of letters of credit 
we refer to this tranche as the acquisition line 
the floorplan line bears interest at rates equal to libor plus basis points for new vehicle inventory and libor plus basis points for used vehicle inventory

total cash used in completing the redemption  excluding accrued interest of million  was million 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures include expenditures to extend the useful life of current facilities and expenditures to start or expand operations 
historically  our annual capital expenditures  exclusive of new or expanded operations  have approximately equaled our annual depreciation charge 
in general  expenditures relating to the construction or expansion of dealership facilities are driven by new franchises being granted to us by a manufacturer  significant growth in sales at an existing facility  or manufacturer imaging programs 
during  we plan to invest approximately million to expand or relocate ten existing facilities  including the purchase of land and related equipment  and to perform manufacturer required imaging projects at nine additional locations 
we expect to sell and lease back seven of the projects scheduled for completion during expected total proceeds from the sales of these construction projects are estimated at approximately million  resulting in net capital expenditures for new and expanded operations of million 
upon sale we will begin leasing the facilities from the buyers  resulting in an estimated incremental annual rent expense of million per year 
acquisitions 
from january   through december   we completed acquisitions of seven franchises with expected annual revenues of approximately million 
these franchises were acquired in tuck in acquisitions that complement existing operations in massachusetts  oklahoma and texas 
the aggregate consideration paid in completing these acquisitions was approximately million in cash  net of cash received and the incurrence of million of inventory financing 
our acquisition target for is to complete acquisitions that have at least million in expected aggregate annual revenues 
we expect the cash needed to complete our acquisitions will come from excess working capital  operating cash flows of our dealerships  and borrowings under our floorplan facilities and our acquisition line 
depending on the market value of our common stock  we may use common stock to fund a portion of the purchase price of acquisitions 
we purchase businesses based on expected return on investment 
generally  the purchase price is approximately to of the annual revenue 
thus  our targeted acquisition budget of million is expected to cost us between and million  excluding the amount incurred to finance vehicle inventories 
since december   we have completed the acquisition of two franchises 
stock repurchases 
in march  our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our stock  subject to management s judgment and the restrictions of our various debt agreements 
as of december   million remained under the board of directors march authorization 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million  thereby completing the previously authorized repurchase program 
future repurchases are subject to the discretion of our board of directors after considering our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  capital requirements  outlook for our business  general business conditions and other factors 
dividends 
prior to february   we had never declared or paid dividends on our common stock 
on february   our board of directors declared a dividend of per common share for the fourth quarter of we expect these dividend payments on our outstanding common stock and common stock equivalents to total approximately million in the first quarter of the payment of any future dividend is subject to the discretion of our board of directors after considering our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  capital requirements  outlook for our business  general business conditions and other factors 
provisions of our credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes require us to maintain certain financial ratios and limit the amount of disbursements we may make outside the ordinary course of business 
these include limitations on the payment of cash dividends and on stock repurchases  which are limited to a percentage of cumulative net income 
as of december   our senior subordinated notes indenture the most restrictive agreement with respect to such limits  limited future dividends and stock repurchases to million 
this amount will increase or decrease in future periods by adding to the current limitation the sum of of our consolidated net income  if positive  and of equity issuances  less actual dividends or stock repurchases completed in each quarterly period 
our revolving credit facility matures in and our senior subordinated notes mature in contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years thereafter in thousands floorplan notes payable long term debt obligations estimated interest payments on floorplan notes payable estimated interest payments on long term debt obligations operating leases purchase commitments total includes million of outstanding letters of credit 
estimated interest payments were calculated using the floorplan balance and weighted average interest rate at december   and the assumption that these liabilities would be settled within days which approximates our weighted average inventory days supply 
estimated interest payments on long term debt obligations includes fixed rate interest on our senior subordinated notes due includes capital expenditures  acquisition commitments and other 
we  acting through our subsidiaries  are the lessee under many real estate leases that provide for our use of the respective dealership premises 
generally  our real estate and facility leases have year total terms with initial terms of years and three additional five year terms  at our option 
pursuant to these leases  our subsidiaries generally agree to indemnify the lessor and other parties from certain liabilities arising as a result of the use of the leased premises  including environmental liabilities  or a breach of the lease by the lessee 
additionally  from time to time  we enter into agreements in connection with the sale of assets or businesses in which we agree to indemnify the purchaser  or other parties  from certain liabilities or costs arising in connection with the assets or business 
also  in the ordinary course of business in connection with purchases or sales of goods and services  we enter into agreements that may contain indemnification provisions 
in the event that an indemnification claim is asserted  liability would be limited by the terms of the applicable agreement 
from time to time  primarily in connection with dealership dispositions  our subsidiaries assign or sublet to the dealership purchaser the subsidiaries interests in any real property leases associated with such stores 
in general  our subsidiaries retain responsibility for the performance of certain obligations under such leases to the extent that the assignee or sublessee does not perform  whether such performance is required prior to or following the assignment or subletting of the lease 
additionally  we and our subsidiaries generally remain subject to the terms of any guarantees made by us and our subsidiaries in connection with such leases 
although we generally have indemnification rights against the assignee or sublessee in the event of non performance under these leases  as well as certain defenses  and we presently have no reason to believe that we or our subsidiaries will be called on to perform under any such assigned leases or subleases  we estimate that lessee rental payment obligations during the remaining terms of these leases are approximately million at december  we and our subsidiaries also may be called on to perform other obligations under these leases  such as environmental remediation of the leased premises or repair of the leased premises upon termination of the lease  although we presently have no reason to believe that we or our subsidiaries will be called on to so perform and such obligations cannot be quantified at this time 
our exposure under these leases is difficult to estimate and there can be no assurance that any performance of us or our subsidiaries required under these leases would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following information about our market sensitive financial instruments constitutes a forward looking statement 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
our policy is to manage interest rate exposure through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
at december   fixed rate debt  primarily consisting of our senior subordinated notes outstanding  totaled million and had a fair value of million 
at december   we had million of variable rate floorplan borrowings outstanding 
based on this amount  a basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change to our interest expense 
after consideration of the interest rate swaps described below  a basis point increase would yield a net increase of million 
we received million of interest assistance from certain automobile manufacturers during the year ended december  this assistance is reflected as a million reduction of our new vehicle cost of sales for the year ended december   and reduced our new vehicle inventory by million and million at december  and  respectively 
for the past three years  the reduction to our new vehicle cost of sales has ranged from approximately to of our floorplan interest expense 
although we can provide no assurance as to the amount of future interest assistance  it is our expectation  based on historical data that an increase in prevailing interest rates would result in increased assistance from certain manufacturers 
we may use interest rate swaps to adjust our exposure to interest rate movements when appropriate based upon market conditions 
these swaps are entered into with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
we reflect the current fair value of all derivatives on our balance sheet 
the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of a derivative contract does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the items being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
all of our interest rate hedges are designated as cash flow hedges 
in december  we entered into two interest rate swaps with total notional value of million 
the hedge instruments are designed to convert floating rate vehicle floorplan payables under our revolving credit facility to fixed rate debt 
one swap  with million in notional value  effectively locks in a rate of and the second swap  also with million in notional value  effectively locks in a rate of 
both of these hedge instruments expire december  at december   net unrealized losses  net of income taxes  related to hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive loss totaled million 
we had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  for the years ended december  and  the income statement impact from interest rate hedges was an additional expense of million and million  respectively 
at december   all of our derivative contracts were determined to be highly effective  and no ineffective portion was recognized in income 
in january  we entered into one additional interest rate swap with a notional value of million 
this hedge instrument is designed to convert floating rate vehicle floorplan payables under our revolving credit facility to fixed rate debt 
this swap effectively locks in a rate of and expires december
