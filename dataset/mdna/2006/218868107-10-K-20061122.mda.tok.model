item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations review of historic stock option practices the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
this annual report on form k is being filed late as a result of a review of the company s historical stock option granting practices 
certain information resulting from the review was necessary to complete the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the company 
the review was not completed until november as further described below 
in mid june  the company began a comprehensive internal review of its historical stock option practices 
on july   the company s board of directors established a special committee the special committee of independent board members to conduct an investigation of the company s historic stock option practices dating back to the company s initial public offering in the special committee retained independent counsel to assist with its review 
the special committee has completed its investigation and in november presented its final report to the company s board of directors  in which it reported that it had found no evidence of fraud or willful misconduct with regard to the company s historic stock option grant practices 
the special committee also made recommendations to the board based on the results of its investigation  which the board has accepted for consideration 
based on the company s internal review and the special committee s investigation and findings  the company has determined that it had unrecorded non cash equity based compensation charges and related employment taxes associated with certain of its historical stock option grants 
the company believes that these accounting errors are immaterial to its financial statements in each of the periods to which such charges would have related fiscal years through and therefore  will not restate any of its historic financial statements to record such charges 
the company has early adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements  sab 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sab  the company has recorded the cumulative effect of the additional non cash stock option compensation expense and related employment taxes from fiscal years through of million as an entry to the beginning retained earnings balance at july  the company also recorded an expense net of tax of million in its fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june  the company voluntarily informed the securities and exchange commission the sec of the special committee review in july on august   the sec notified the company it is conducting an informal inquiry into the company s historic stock option grants 
the company is cooperating with the sec in its inquiry 
please refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information regarding this matter 
background and overview as of june   we operated colleges  with more than  students  in states and canadian provinces 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company had net revenues of million 
our revenues consist principally of student tuition and fees and are presented as net revenues after adjustments for refunds related to students who do not complete their courses 
we recognize revenues pro rata on a straight line basis over the relevant period attended by the student of the applicable course or program 
net revenues increased to million in from million in during october  we completed the sale of our corporate training division  cdi education 
excluding our corporate training division  revenues for fiscal increased million  or compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to a increase in the average tuition rate per student partially offset by a decrease in the average student population during the period 
the student population varies depending on  among other factors  the number of i continuing students at the beginning of a fiscal period  ii new student enrollments during the fiscal period  iii students who have previously withdrawn but who reenter during the fiscal period  and iv graduations and withdrawals during the fiscal period 
new student starts typically occur several times per month in the diploma granting colleges 
in the degree granting colleges  the majority of new student starts occur in the first month of each calendar quarter with an additional mini start in the second month of each quarter in most colleges 
the tuition charges vary by college depending on the local market  the program level diploma  associate s  bachelor s or master s degree and the specific curriculum 
the majority of students at our colleges rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenues  on a cash basis  were derived from federal student financial aid programs 
we categorize our expenses as educational services  general and administrative  and marketing and admissions 
educational services expenses primarily consist of those costs incurred to deliver and administer the education programs at the colleges  including faculty and college administration compensation  college facility rent and other occupancy costs  bad debt expense  education materials and supplies  bookstore and classroom expenses  depreciation and amortization of college property and equipment  default management expenses and financial aid processing costs 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of those costs incurred at the campus support center and regional level in support of college operations  except for marketing and admissions related costs 
included in general and administrative expenses are costs relating to executive management  campus support center staff and regional operations management compensation  depreciation and amortization of corporate property and equipment and certain intangibles  rent and other occupancy costs for campus support center  and other expenses incurred at campus support center 
additionally  all bonus and other incentive compensation expenses are included in general and administrative expenses 
marketing and admissions expenses include compensation for college admissions staff  regional admissions personnel  compensation expenses for marketing management  and all direct marketing and production costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts on those financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  contingencies and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or if our assumptions change 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
revenues consist primarily of tuition and fees derived from courses taught in our colleges  schools 
revenues from tuition and fees are recognized pro rata on a straight line basis over the relevant period attended by the student of the applicable course or program 
our pro rata revenue recognition policy for diploma schools calculates revenue on a daily basis for some of the company s schools and using a mid month convention for other schools 
if a student withdraws from a course or program  the paid but unearned portion of the student s tuition is refunded 
textbook sales and other revenues are recognized as sales occur or services are performed and represent less than of total revenues 
prepaid tuition is the portion of payments received but not earned and is reflected as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as this amount is expected to be earned within the next year 
students attending our post secondary institutions enroll in either i diploma programs  which cover a specific area of training over a discrete length of time averaging nine months for such programs or ii courses leading to an associate s  bachelor s or master s degree 
costs of programs or credit hours for courses are clearly identified in our enrollment agreements 
at the start of each student s respective program or courses of study leading to a degree  the student executes an enrollment agreement which specifies the field of study  the expected length of study  and the cost of the program or courses 
we recognize revenue from tuition and fees on a straight line basis over the relevant period attended by the student of the applicable course or program of study 
if a student withdraws from an institution  we cease the recognition of revenue and the paid but unearned portion of the student s tuition is refunded 
additionally  to ensure the delivery of education has occurred  either attendance is taken or academic events are conducted at appropriate intervals to ensure that the student is completing his or her respective field of study within the acceptable time period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our students to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the accounts receivable aging and applying various expected loss percentages to certain student accounts receivable categories based upon historical bad debt experience 
we generally write off accounts receivable balances deemed uncollectible as they are sent to collection agencies 
we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs 
these balances are unsecured and not guaranteed 
we believe our reserves are adequate  however  losses related to unpaid student balances could exceed the amounts we have reserved for bad debts 
many of our students in the us participate in federally guaranteed student loan programs 
the federally guaranteed student loans are authorized by the higher education act hea of and are guaranteed by an agency of the federal government 
the guaranteed loans are not guaranteed by us  and the guaranteed student loans cannot become an obligation of ours 
accordingly  we do not record an obligation to repay any of the guaranteed loans that are not repaid by our former students and we do not record either a contingent obligation or an allowance for future obligations as a result of student defaults of federally guaranteed student loans 
the guarantee of student loans is provided by an agency of the federal government  not by us 
if an institution s former students default rate on guaranteed loans cohort default rate equals or exceeds for three consecutive years  the institution may lose participation eligibility in the guaranteed loan program and its students would be denied access to the guaranteed loan program 
our institutions cohort default rates act as a gatekeeper to their eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs 
we have no obligation to repay any of the federally guaranteed loans that our former students default upon  even if the cohort default rates of our students exceed permitted levels 
rather  if the cohort default rates at a particular institution exceed for three consecutive years  the institution s students may lose eligibility to receive federal student financial aid 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we have significant goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired  including identified intangible assets 
we consider a number of factors  including valuations and appraisals from independent valuation firms  in determining the amounts that are assignable to other intangible assets  such as curriculum  accreditation  and trade names 
we  however  are ultimately responsible for the valuations 
the fair value of identified intangible assets is derived using accepted valuation methodologies  including cost  market  and income approaches  as appropriate  following consultations with valuation firms and in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 and requirements set forth by the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice 

table of contents effective july   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

this standard changed the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
as of july   we ceased amortization of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations 
in addition  we conducted a review of our other identifiable intangible assets and determined that accreditation and trade names met the indefinite life criteria outlined in sfas no 
our review considered analysis of all pertinent factors  including the expected use of the asset  any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset 
accordingly  we also ceased amortization of the accreditation and trade names as of july  curricula continue to be amortized over their useful lives ranging generally from three to ten years and the amortization is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is tested annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  by comparing its fair value to its carrying amount at the reporting unit level as defined by sfas no 
we determined the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach of valuation that includes discounted cash flow as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies 
to the extent the fair value of a reporting unit is less that the carrying amount of its assets  we record an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations 
also  under sfas no 
 indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  by comparing their fair values to their carrying amounts 
to the extent the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  we record an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations 
for instance  if we were to discontinue the use of a trade name or lose accreditation at one or more of our acquired schools to which we have ascribed value for trade names and accreditation  we would test the amounts we have allocated to such assets for impairment 
such testing would include estimating the future cash flows expected to be received from the trade names and accreditation and comparing them to their carrying values 
if our estimate of the present value of these future cash flows were below the carrying values of the related assets  we would consider the assets to be impaired and take a charge against the amounts we had allocated to trade names and accreditation 
the determination of related estimated useful lives of intangible assets and whether or not these intangible assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
although we believe our goodwill and intangible assets are fairly stated  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to asset balances 
deferred taxes 
we currently have deferred income tax assets which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized 
realization of our deferred income tax assets is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income offset by deferred income tax liabilities 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred income tax assets annually 
contingencies 
in the ordinary conduct of the business  we are subject to occasional lawsuits  investigations and claims  including  but not limited to  claims involving students and graduates and routine employment matters 
when we are aware of a claim or potential claim  we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure 
if it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the loss 
if the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated  we disclose the nature of the specific claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount involved is material 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of any of the matters disclosed will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

results of operations comparisons of results of operations between the fiscal year ended june  and the fiscal years ended june  and are complicated by the opening of branch campuses in fiscal  the opening of branch campuses and the acquisition of campus in fiscal  and the opening of branch campuses and the acquisition of campuses and training centers in fiscal during november  the company completed the sale of substantially all the assets of its corporate training division  cdi education which provided technology it and business skills training at locations throughout canada and had revenues of approximately cdn million million usd in fiscal year end june  in july  the company announced that it would streamline its cdi post secondary schools by beginning the teach out of campuses in canada 
as part of the teach out process  the company immediately ceased new student enrollments in the ten affected campuses  but continued to incur instructional costs through the remainder of fiscal in order to train its then matriculated students 
the teach outs resulted in the closure of all ten campuses by the end of fiscal these closures were designed to permit the company to reallocate resources in canada for the remaining cdi post secondary campuses in which the company believes it has better prospects for growth and profitability 
additionally  the company slowed the roll out of new branch campuses during fiscal and compared to fiscal  and became very selective in its acquisition criteria completing only one transaction in early fiscal  in order to focus on achieving better utilization of the significant new capacity it obtained through the opening of branch campuses and the acquisition of campuses in fiscal

student population varies as a result of new student enrollments and student attrition 
historically  our colleges  schools and training centers have had lower student populations in the first fiscal quarter than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary as significantly as student population and revenues 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns 
such patterns may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new branch openings  new program adoptions and increased enrollments from recent high school graduates 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period
