item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s results of operations are dependent upon the difference between prices received for its oil and gas production and the costs to find and produce such oil and gas 
oil and gas prices have been and are expected in the future to be volatile and subject to fluctuations based on a number of factors beyond the control of the company 
the company operates the etame field on behalf of a consortium of five companies offshore of the republic of gabon 
the phase development of the field occurred in and consisted of completing three wells producing into an fpso 
the phase development commenced in and consisted of adding two wells to the etame field  one in and one in in  the company will jointly develop the avouma south tchibala discoveries by setting a platform and tying the field back to the fpso via a pipeline 
the platform in currently under construction in louisiana and will be installed during the summer of  with first production expected in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the company s results of operations and financial condition are affected by currency exchange rates 
while oil sales are denominated in us dollars  portions of the operating costs in gabon are denominated in the local currency 
an increase in the exchange rate of the local currency to the dollar will have the effect of increasing operating costs while a decrease in the exchange rate will reduce operating costs 
the gabon local currency is tied to the euro 
the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar has fluctuated widely in response to international political conditions  general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
the euro appreciated substantially against the us dollar in and  while in the us dollar appreciated against the euro 
a substantial portion of the company s oil production is located offshore gabon 
in gabon  the company produces into a million barrel fpso and sells cargos to trafigura beheer  bv at spot market prices 
critical accounting policies the following describes the critical accounting policies used by vaalco in reporting its financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting  such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below 
in those cases  the company s reported results of operations would be different should it employ an alternative accounting method 
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities the sec prescribes in regulation s x the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in oil and gas producing activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
like many other oil and gas companies  the company has chosen to follow the successful efforts method 
management believes that this method is preferable  as the company has focused on exploration activities wherein there is risk associated with future success and as such earnings are best represented by attachment to the drilling operations of the company 
costs of successful wells  development dry holes and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis over the life of the related reserves 
for financial accounting purposes the company adopted sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations on january  this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred by capitalizing it as part of the carrying amount of the long lived assets 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical expenses applicable to undeveloped leasehold  leasehold expiration costs and delay rentals are expensed as incurred 
in accordance with accounting under successful efforts  the company reviews proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its oil and gas properties may not be recoverable 
when it is determined that an oil and gas property s estimated future net cash flows will not be sufficient to recover its carrying amount  an impairment charge must be recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
this may occur if a field discovers lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field 
suspended well costs fasb statement no 
under the successful efforts method of accounting used by the company for its oil and gas exploration and development costs  all expenditures related to exploration  with the exception of costs of drilling exploratory wells are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of exploratory wells are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether commercially producible oil and gas reserves have been discovered 
if the determination is made that a well did not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantities  the well costs are charged to expense 
these determinations are re evaluated quarterly 

table of contents 
index to financial statements for capitalized exploration drilling costs  if it is determined that a development plan is feasible  and the development plan is approved by the gabon government  costs associated with the exploratory wells will be transferred along with the costs spent on the development to wells  platforms and other production facilities at the time of first production 
the costs will subsequently be amortized on a unit of production based method over the life of the reserves as they are produced 
in the event it were determined that the discoveries are not commercial  the costs of the exploratory wells would be expensed 
for offshore exploratory discoveries  it is not unusual to have exploratory well costs remain suspended while additional appraisal and engineering work on the potential oil and gas field is performed and regulatory and government approvals are sought 
in gabon  the government must approve the commerciality of the reserves  assign a development area and approve a formal development plan prior to a field being developed 
on april   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fsp fas  which addressed a discussion that was ongoing within the oil industry regarding capitalization of costs of drilling exploratory wells 
paragraph of fasb statement no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies fasb no 
 requires costs of drilling exploratory wells to be capitalized pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if the well has found proved reserves  the capitalized costs become part of the entity s wells  equipment  and facilities 
if  however  the well has not found proved reserves  the capitalized costs of drilling the well are expensed 
questions arose in practice about the application of this guidance due to changes in oil and gas exploration processes and lifecycles 
the issue was whether there are circumstances that would permit the continued capitalization of exploratory well costs if reserves cannot be classified as proved within one year following the completion of drilling  other than when additional exploration wells are necessary to justify major capital expenditures and those wells are underway or firmly planned for the near future 
fsp fas amends fasb no 
to allow for the continued capitalization of suspended well costs when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the plan 
the issuance of this amendment did not result in an adjustment to the company s suspended well costs 
the company had million of suspended well costs associated with exploration wells at avouma and ebouri in gabon at december   which is being carried as work in progress 
in february  the company received approval to declare the avouma reserves commercial from the gabon government and in april the gabon government approved a joint development plan for the avouma south tchibala discoveries  and assigned a twenty year development area 
construction of the platform facilities to develop avouma south tchibala is ongoing

historically  the company s primary sources of capital resources has been from cash flows from operations  private sales of equity  borrowings and purchase money debt 
on december   the company had cash balances of million 
the company believes that this cash balance combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s capital expenditure budget of approximately million to develop the avouma field and additional investments in working capital resulting from potential growth

r  share based payment  which establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions with employees  and carries forward without change to prior guidance for share based payments for transactions with non employees 
sfas no 
r eliminates the intrinsic value measurement objective in apb opinion and generally requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
such cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award which is usually the vesting period 
the standard also requires the company to estimate the number of instruments that will ultimately be issued  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
the company is required to apply sfas no 
r to all awards granted  modified or settled in the first reporting period under us gaap after june  the company is also required to use either the modified prospective method or the modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  the company must recognize compensation cost for all awards granted after the company adopts the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that are outstanding on that date 

table of contents 
index to financial statements under the modified retrospective method  the company must restate previously issued financial statements to recognize the amounts the company previously calculated and reported on a pro forma basis  as if the prior standard had been adopted 
see note stock based compensation 
under both methods  the company is permitted to use either a straight line or an accelerated method to amortize the cost as an expense for awards with graded vesting 
the standard permits and encourages early adoption 
the company has commenced the analysis of the impact of sfas r  but has not yet decided whether the company will use the modified prospective method or elect to use the modified retrospective method  and whether the company will elect to use straight line amortization or an accelerated method 
additionally  the company cannot predict with reasonable certainty the number of options that will be unvested and outstanding upon adoption 
accordingly  the company cannot currently quantify with precision the effect that this standard would have on its financial position or results of operations in the future  except that the company probably will recognize a greater expense for any awards that the company may grant in the future than the company would using the current guidance

under previous guidance  paragraph of arb no 
 chapter  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs might be considered to be so abnormal  under certain circumstances  as to require treatment as current period charges 
this statement eliminates the criterion of so abnormal and requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
this statement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june   although earlier application is permitted for fiscal years beginning after the date of issuance of this statement

sales prices are primarily driven by the prevailing market price 
historically  prices received for oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
interest rate market risk at december   total debt was million 
the debt is tied to floating or market interest rates 
fluctuations in floating interest rates will cause the company s annual interest costs to fluctuate 
during the fourth quarter of  the interest rate on the company s bank debt averaged 
if the balance of the bank debt at december  were to remain constant  a change in market interest rates would impact our cash flow by an estimated  per quarter 
commodity risk the company has utilized derivative commodity instruments to hedge future sales prices on a portion of its oil production to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure to adverse price fluctuations of oil 
the derivatives were not held for trading purposes 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it also limits increases in future revenues as a result of favorable price movements 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties are unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
hedging instruments that the company has used are collars  which the company generally places with major investment grade financial institutions believed to have minimal credit risks 
the company had no derivatives in place as of the date of this report
