one of our largest customers is also a major competitor 
our sales to this customer may decline 
net sales to the retail group of luxottica  which include sunglass hut locations worldwide  were approximately  and of the company s net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
luxottica is also one of the company s largest competitors in the sunglass and optical frame markets 
in december  the company and luxottica entered into a commercial agreement that established the terms applicable for between the two companies 
the term of the commercial agreement expired at the end of we are currently engaged in discussions with luxottica to establish a new commercial agreement  but there can be no assurances as to the future of our relationship with luxottica or the likelihood that we will reach an agreement on acceptable terms 
during the past several years  luxottica has acquired certain customers of the company which  in some cases  has adversely impacted the company s net sales to such customers 
there can be no assurance that the recent acquisitions or future acquisitions by luxottica  or the lack of a contract with luxottica  will not have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the industries in which we compete are highly competitive  we may not be successful in developing products that enable us to compete effectively 
the consumer products industries are highly competitive and are subject to rapidly changing consumer demands and preferences 
the company competes with numerous domestic and foreign designers  brands and manufacturers of eyewear  apparel and accessories  electronics  footwear and watches  some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than the company 
the company believes that its success depends in large part upon its ability to anticipate  gauge and respond to changing consumer demands in a timely manner and to continually appeal to consumers of the oakley brand 
increased competition in the worldwide premium sunglass  prescription eyewear  apparel and accessories  electronics  footwear and watch industries could reduce the company s sales and prices and could adversely affect its business and financial condition 
our markets are characterized by frequent product innovation and changing consumer preferences 
as a result  we could accumulate significant unsold inventory  which may require us to reduce prices and experience reduced sales  margins and consumer acceptance 
the premium sunglass  prescription eyewear  apparel and accessories  electronics  footwear  goggles and watch industries are characterized by constant product innovation due to changing consumer preferences 
as a result  the company believes its success depends in large part on its ability to continuously develop  market and deliver innovative and stylish products at a pace  intensity and price competitive with other brands 
in addition  the electronics category is generally subject to short product life cycles because of rapid technology innovation 
as a result  sales of the company s products may be subject to rebates  markdown allowances  price reductions and other customer considerations in the relevant distribution channels 
if the company fails to regularly and rapidly develop innovative products and update core products or if fashion trends shift away from the company s products  or if the company otherwise misjudges the market for its product lines  the company may be faced with a significant amount of unsold finished goods inventory  and such conditions could adversely affect retail and consumer acceptance of 
table of contents the company s products  limit sales growth or cause other conditions which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
we could be significantly harmed if any of our key personnel were to depart 
the company s operations depend to a great extent on the efforts of its key executive officers and other key qualified personnel  many of whom would be extremely difficult to replace 
the loss of those key executive officers and qualified personnel may cause a significant disruption to the company s business and could adversely affect the company s operations 
we may not be successful in protecting our proprietary rights  which could permit competitors to offer products that compete more effectively and could increase our enforcement costs 
the company relies in part on patent  trade secret  unfair competition  trade dress  trademark and copyright law to protect its right to certain aspects of its products  including product designs  proprietary manufacturing processes and technologies  product research and concepts and recognized trademarks  all of which the company believes are important to the success of its products and its competitive position 
there can be no assurance that any pending trademark or patent application will result in the issuance of a registered trademark or patent  or that any trademark or patent granted will be effective in thwarting competition or be held valid if subsequently challenged 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the actions taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of its products  that the company s proprietary information will not become known to competitors  that the company can meaningfully protect its right to unpatented proprietary information or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent or better products that do not infringe on the company s intellectual property rights 
moreover  over the next four years  us patents and international patents that we currently hold will expire 
the remainder of our patents will expire starting in no assurance can be given that others will not assert rights in  and ownership of  the patents and other proprietary rights of the company 
also  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect the company s intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
consistent with the company s strategy of vigorously defending its intellectual property rights  oakley devotes substantial resources to the enforcement of patents issued and trademarks granted to the company  to the protection of trade secrets  trade dress or other intellectual property rights owned by the company and to the determination of the scope or validity of the proprietary rights of others that might be asserted against the company 
a substantial increase in the level of potentially infringing activities by others could require the company to increase significantly the resources devoted to such efforts 
in addition  an adverse determination in litigation could subject the company to the loss of its rights to a particular patent  trademark  copyright or trade secret  could require the company to grant licenses to third parties  could prevent the company from manufacturing  selling or using certain aspects of its products or could subject the company to substantial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 

table of contents we are dependent upon a single source supplier for a major component 
the loss of this or other major suppliers could materially adversely affect our business 
in  the company executed a new exclusive agreement with a supplier that is the company s single source for the supply of uncoated lens blanks from which a majority of its sunglass lenses are cut 
in the event of the loss of this supplier  the company has identified an alternate source 
there can be no assurance that  if necessary  an additional source of supply for lens blanks or other critical materials could be located or developed in a timely manner 
the effect of the loss of this source including any possible disruption in business will depend primarily upon the length of time necessary to find and use a suitable alternative source and could have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
if the company were to lose the source for its lens blanks or other critical materials  it could have a materially adverse effect on the company s business 
our principal shareholder may exercise control over the company 
the company s chairman  jim jannard  beneficially owned a majority of the outstanding common stock of the company at december  consequently  mr 
jannard has majority control of the company and the ability to control the election of directors and the results of other matters submitted to a vote of shareholders 
this concentration of ownership may have various effects  including but not limited to  delaying or preventing a change in control of the company 
we have recently acquired  and may in the future acquire  other businesses 
the integration of these businesses would require substantial time and resources and may not be successful 
we completed an acquisition in february  announced the signing of a definitive agreement of another acquisition in march which is expected to close by june   and plan to continue to consider strategic acquisitions now and in the future 
management will continue to evaluate potential strategic transactions and alternatives that it believes may enhance shareholder value 
these potential future transactions may include a variety of different business arrangements  including spin offs  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  licensing arrangements  restructurings  divestitures  business combinations and equity or debt investments 
integrating acquisitions is often costly  and delays or other operational or financial problems may result that interfere with our operations 
if we fail to implement proper business controls for companies we acquire or fail to successfully integrate these acquired companies in our processes  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  it is possible that we may incur significant expenses in the evaluation and pursuit of potential transactions and that such transactions may not be successfully completed 
in these events  we may incur substantial costs without any corresponding benefit 
other risks inherent in our acquisition strategy included diversion of management s attention and resources  failure to retain key personnel and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities 
in addition  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances exist which indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
as a result of changes in circumstances after valuing assets in connection with acquisitions  we may be required to take write downs of intangible assets  including goodwill  which could be significant 

table of contents we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties arising out of our substantial international operations 
sales outside the united states accounted for approximately   and of the company s net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain or increase its international sales 
the company s international operations and international commerce are influenced by many factors  including currency exchange rate fluctuations or restrictions  local economic and political instability  wars  civil unrest  acts of terrorism and other conflicts  natural disasters  changes in legal or regulatory requirements affecting foreign investment  loans  tariffs and taxes  and less protective foreign laws relating to intellectual property changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments 
the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict the company s ability to operate in the affected region and or decrease the profitability of its operations in that region 
pursuant to the world trade organization wto agreement  effective january   the united states and other wto member countries removed quotas from wto members 
as the removal of quotas resulted in an import surge from china  the us took action in may and imposed safeguard quotas on seven categories of goods 
exports of each specified product category will continue to be admitted into the united states in the ordinary course until the restraint level for that category is reached  after which further exports will be embargoed and will not be cleared until after january additionally  on june   in response to the surge of chinese imports into the european union eu  the eu commission signed a memorandum of understanding mou with china in which ten categories of textiles and apparel will be subject to restraints 
certain of the company s apparel products fall within the categories subject to the safeguards in the us and the eu  which could adversely affect the company s ability to import these products from china and make them available to sell 
at this time  based on expected us and eu actions and other mitigating factors  the company believes that such safeguard measures will not have a material impact on its sales in the us and eu  but no assurance can be given with respect to the impact on its sales 
there can be no assurance that additional trade restrictions will not be imposed on the imports of the company s products in the future 
such actions could result in increases in the cost of its products generally and may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
we are dependent upon endorsement contracts with athletes and personalities  who may discontinue arrangements that may not be replaced suitable alternatives 
a key element of the company s marketing strategy has been to establish contacts with  and obtain endorsement from  prominent athletes and public personalities 
these endorsement contracts generally have terms from one to four years 
the company also furnishes its products at a reduced cost or without charge to selected athletes and personalities who wear oakley products without any formal arrangement 
there can be no assurance that any of these relationships with athletes and personalities will continue  that such contracts will be renewed  and that the athletes and personalities selected will remain popular or successful  or that the company will be able to attract new athletes to wear or endorse its products 
if oakley were unable in the future to arrange endorsements of its products by athletes and or public personalities on terms it deems reasonable  it would be required to modify its marketing plans and could be forced to rely more heavily on other forms of advertising and promotion  which might not prove to be as effective as endorsements 

table of contents possible volatility of stock price the market price for shares of the company s common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate based upon a number of factors  including  without limitation  business performance  news announcements or changes in general market conditions 
other factors  in addition to the those risks included in this section  that may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock include  but are not limited to receipt of substantial orders or order cancellations of products  quality deficiencies in services or products  international developments  such as technology mandates  political developments or changes in economic policies  changes in recommendations of securities analysts  shortfalls in the company s backlog  revenues or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts or projected by the company  government regulations  including stock option accounting and tax regulations  energy blackouts  acts of terrorism and war  widespread illness  proprietary rights or product or patent litigation  strategic transactions  such as acquisitions and divestitures  rumors or allegations regarding the company s financial disclosures or practices  currency exchange rate fluctuations or changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivative instruments  natural disasters  or earthquakes concentrated in southern california where a significant portion of the company s operations are based and could result in a disruption of its operations  manufacturing and information systems 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
due to changes in the volatility of the company s common stock price  the company may be the target of securities litigation in the future 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview oakley is an innovation driven designer  manufacturer and distributor of consumer products that include premium sunglasses  prescription eyewear  goggles  apparel and accessories  electronics  footwear and watches 
our products are distributed in the united states through a base of retail accounts that fluctuates between approximately  and  accounts  comprising approximately  to  locations depending on seasonality of summer and winter products 
oakley s retail account base is comprised of optical stores  sunglass retailers and specialty sports stores  including bike  surf  snow  skate  golf and motorcycle stores  sporting goods stores and department stores 
the company also operates oakley retail stores in the united states that offer a full range of oakley products 
additionally  the company owns iacon  inc  a sunglass retailing chain headquartered in scottsdale  arizona  with sunglass specialty retail stores at december  the company also owns and operates six international oakley stores and licenses nine additional international oakley store locations 
internationally  the company sells its products through its wholly owned subsidiaries in australia  brazil  canada  france  germany  italy  japan  mexico  new zealand  south africa and the united kingdom 
additionally  in parts of the world not serviced by the company or its subsidiaries  oakley products are sold through distributors who possess local expertise 
these distributors sell the company s products either exclusively or with complementary products and agree to comply with the marketing philosophy and practices of the company 
after review of the oakley brand and its business  the company announced in february  several initiatives it believes will position the company for improved revenue growth and profitability 
these initiatives include refocusing the company on its optics business  realigning its apparel platform  exiting from a significant portion of its footwear business  and increasing its investment in brand development 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  the company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods 
actual results could significantly differ from such estimates 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most significant accounting policies  and aids in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results 
revenue recognition the company recognizes wholesale revenue when merchandise is shipped to a customer and the risks and rewards of ownership and title have passed based on the terms of sale  there is evidence of a contractual arrangement  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from the company s retail store operations is recognized upon purchase by customers at the point of sale 
the company also licenses to third parties the rights to certain intellectual property and other proprietary information and recognizes royalty revenue when earned 
generally  the company extends credit to its wholesale customers and does not require collateral 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of those customers and historically  credit losses have been insignificant and within management s expectations 

table of contents the company s standard sales agreements with its wholesale customers do not provide for any rights of return by the customer other than returns for product warranty related issues 
in addition to these product warranty related returns  the company may  at its discretion  accept other returns 
the company records a provision for estimated future warranty related product returns based upon historical data 
the company records provisions for other returns or sales discounts based upon analysis of  and decisions made regarding  reseller inventories in the company s distribution channels 
actual returns and claims in any future period may differ from the company s estimates 
the company s standard sales agreements with its wholesale customers do not provide for price protection or margin guarantees 
the company has at times  and at its discretion  provided its wholesale customers with sales discounts or markdown allowances to assist the sell through of their slow moving inventories 
the company records provisions for sales discounts  markdown allowances  rebates and similar commitments based upon analysis of  and decisions made regarding  reseller inventories in the company s distribution channels 
inventory sale and purchase transactions with the same third party in certain cases  in the electronics category  the company sells eyewear components to a third party electronics vendor and subsequently purchases finished goods from the same electronics vendor which contain such eyewear components 
the electronics vendor sells the finished goods through its distribution channels 
the electronics vendor has no right to return eyewear components to the company 
the company has the right  but not any obligation  to purchase finished goods from the electronics vendor  at a defined price  for sale to its own wholesale and retail customers 
net sales of eyewear components to the electronics vendor are eliminated from the company s net sales to the extent that the company has purchased  or intends to purchase  finished goods from the electronics vendor 
eyewear components sold to the electronics vendor which the company intends to purchase as part of finished goods are maintained on the company s balance sheet as consignment inventory held by the electronics vendor 
finished goods purchased by the company are placed into inventory at cost  calculated as the invoice value from the electronics vendor less the company s margin on the sale of the related eyewear components to such vendor 
the company recognizes the sale of the finished goods  and relieves related inventory  when such finished goods are sold by the company to its wholesale or retail customers 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory  using the first in  first out method 
the company regularly reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory to appropriately reflect net realizable value for all slow moving and discontinued inventory based upon the company s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
demand for the company s products can fluctuate significantly 
many factors that can affect demand for the company s products include unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors outside the control of the company  which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction in the rate of reorders placed by retailers 

table of contents derivative instruments the company designates its derivatives based upon the criteria established by sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of sfas  sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas  requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for the changes in the fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s fair value gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
any realized gain or loss on such derivative is reported in cost of goods sold in the accounting period in which the derivative matures 
the fair value gain or loss from the ineffective portion of the derivative is reported in cost of goods sold immediately 
for a derivative that does not qualify as a cash flow hedge  the change in fair value is recognized at the end of each accounting period in cost of goods sold 
long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable 
under sfas no 
 the company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows derived from an asset to assess whether or not a potential impairment exists when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset may differ 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
numerous factors  including changes in the company s business  industry segment or the global economy could significantly impact management s decision to retain  dispose of or idle certain of its long lived assets 
no impairments were recorded for the years ended december   or goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and also tested in the event of an impairment indicator 
as required by sfas no 
 the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates the company s cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
the company completed its annual impairment test for the fiscal year ended december  at december   and determined that no impairment loss existed 

table of contents warranties the company provides warranties from days to one year  depending on the product line  against manufacturer s defects on its products when purchased from an authorized oakley dealer 
the company s standard warranties require the company to repair or replace defective product returned to the company during such warranty period with proof of purchase from an authorized oakley dealer 
the company maintains a reserve for its product warranty liability based on estimates calculated using historical warranty experience 
while warranty costs have historically been within the company s expectations  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs as in prior years 
a significant increase in product warranty rates  or a significant increase in the costs to repair product  could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets 
if the company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  the company will reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the company s judgment 
if the company subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
the company believes it has adequately provided for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
at december   million was accrued for such matters 
although not probable  the most adverse resolution of these issues could result in additional charges to earnings in future periods 
based upon a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of tax issues for all open tax periods will have a materially adverse effect upon its results of operations or financial condition 
insurance coverage the company is partially self insured for its workers compensation insurance coverage 
under this insurance program  the company is liable for a deductible of  for each individual claim and an aggregate annual liability of  for claims incurred during the current policy period 
the company records a liability for the actuarially estimated cost of claims both reported  and incurred but not reported  based upon its historical experience 
the estimated costs include the estimated future cost of all open claims 
the company will continue to adjust the estimates as its actual experience dictates 
a significant change in the number or dollar amount of claims or other actuarial assumptions could cause the company to revise its estimate of potential losses and could affect its reported results 

table of contents foreign currency translation the company s subsidiaries outside the united states purchase most of their finished goods in us dollars and collect money at future dates in the customers local currencies 
accordingly  the company is exposed to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
assets and liabilities of the company denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
gains and losses on short term intercompany foreign currency transactions are recognized as incurred 
as part of the company s overall strategy to manage its level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the company and its subsidiaries have entered into various foreign exchange contracts in the form of forward and option contracts
