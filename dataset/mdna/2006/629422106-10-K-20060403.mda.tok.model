see part ii  item selected financial data for a description of certain assumptions made in the combined presentation for and the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical and proforma financial statements appearing in part ii  item critical accounting policies general a critical accounting policy is one that would materially affect our operations or financial condition  and requires management to make estimates or judgments in certain circumstances 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
critical accounting policies discussed in this section are not to be confused with accounting principles and methods disclosed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires information in financial statements about accounting principles  methods used and disclosures pertaining to significant estimates 
the following disclosure discusses judgments known to management pertaining to trends  events or uncertainties known which were taken into consideration upon the application of those policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported upon taking into consideration different conditions and assumptions 
impairment and valuation statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  specifies circumstances in which certain long lived assets must be reviewed for impairment 
if this review indicates that the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the sum of its expected future cash flows  the asset s carrying value must be written down to fair value 
in determining the value of an investment property and whether the investment property is impaired  management considers several factors such as projected rental and vacancy rates  property operating expenses  capital expenditures  interest rates and recent appraisals when available 
the capitalization rate used to determine property valuation is based on among others  the market in which the investment property is located  length of leases  tenant financial strength  the economy in general  demographics  environment  property location  visibility  age and physical condition 
all of these factors are considered by management in determining the value of any particular investment property 
the value of any particular investment property is sensitive to the actual results of any of these factors  either individually or taken as a whole 
if the actual results differ from management s judgment  the valuation could be negatively or positively affected 
the merger and property acquisition were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
business combinations 
nts realty was treated as the purchasing entity 
for the merger  the portion of each partnership s assets and liabilities acquired from unaffiliated third parties was adjusted to reflect its fair market value 
that portion owned by affiliates of the general partners of the partnerships was reflected at historical cost 
the assets and liabilities contributed by nts private group were adjusted to reflect their fair market value  except for that portion owned by mr 
nichols which was reflected at historical cost due to his common control over the contributing entities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have allocated the purchase price of each acquired investment property among land  buildings and improvements  other intangibles  including acquired above market leases  acquired below market leases and acquired in place lease origination cost which is the market cost avoidance of executing the acquired leases 
allocation of the purchase price is an area that requires complex judgments and significant estimates 
we used the information contained in a third party appraisal as the primary basis for allocating the purchase price between land and buildings 
a pro rata portion of the purchase price was allocated to the value of avoiding a lease up period for acquired in place leases 
the value of in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial term of the respective leases 
a portion of the purchase price was allocated to the estimated lease origination cost based on estimated lease execution costs for similar leases and considered various factors including geographic location and size of leased space 
we then evaluated acquired leases based upon current market rates at the acquisition date and various other factors including geographic location  size and the location of leased space within the property  tenant profile and the credit risk of the tenant in determining whether the acquired lease is above or below market 
after acquired leases were determined to be at  above or below market  we allocated a pro rata portion of the purchase price to any acquired above or below market lease based upon the present value of the difference between the contractual lease rate and the estimated market rate 
we also consider an allocation of purchase price to in place leases that have a customer relationship intangible value 
the characteristics we consider in allocating these values include the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant and the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
we did not have any tenants with whom we have identified a developed relationship that we believe had any intangible value 
recognition of rental income under gaap  we are required to recognize rental income based on the effective monthly rent for each lease 
the effective monthly rent is equal to the average monthly rent during the term of the lease  not the stated rent for any particular month 
the process  known as straight lining or stepping rent generally has the effect of increasing rental revenues during the early phases of a lease and decreasing rental revenues in the latter phases of a lease 
due to the impact of straight lining  on a historical combining basis  rental income exceeded the cash collected for rent by approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
if rental income calculated on a straight line basis exceeds the cash rent due under the lease  the difference is recorded as an increase in deferred rent receivable and included as a component of accounts receivable on the relevant balance sheet 
if the cash rent due under the lease exceeds rental income calculated on a straight line basis  the difference is recorded as a decrease in deferred rent receivable and is recorded as a decrease of accounts receivable on the relevant balance sheet 
we defer recognition of contingent rental income  such as percentage or excess rent  until the specified target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved 
we periodically review the collectability of outstanding receivables 
allowances are generally taken for tenants with outstanding balances due for a period greater than ninety days and tenants with outstanding balances due for a period less than ninety days but that we believe are potentially uncollectible 
recognition of lease termination income we recognize lease termination income upon receipt of the income 
we accrue lease termination income if there is a signed termination agreement  all of the conditions of the agreement have been met and the tenant is no longer occupying the property 
cost capitalization and depreciation policies we review all expenditures and capitalize any item exceeding  deemed to be an upgrade or a tenant improvement with an expected useful life greater than one year 
land  buildings and amenities are stated at cost 
depreciation expense is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
buildings and improvements have estimated useful lives between years  land improvements have estimated useful lives between years and amenities have estimated useful lives between years 
acquired above and below market leases are amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the related leases as an adjustment to rental income 
acquired in place lease origination cost is amortized over the life of the lease as a component of amortization expense 
liquidity and capital resources our most liquid asset is our cash and cash equivalents  which consist of cash and short term investments  but do not include any restricted cash 
operating income generated by the properties will be the primary source from which we generate cash 
other sources of cash include the proceeds from mortgage loans and notes payable 
our main uses of cash will relate to capital expenditures  required payments of mortgages and notes payable  distributions and property taxes 
years ended december  operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    net increase decrease in cash and equivalents  cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to cash used to pay accounts payable 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to reduced results of operations and to the change in accounts payable 
as a result of the merger  we were able to reimburse nts development company  an affiliate of ours  for deferred fees and expenses 
the change in accounts payable was also the result of decreased payables related to litigation filed by limited partners and settlement directed merger costs 
cash flow from investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the lakes apartments in august as well as increased capital expenditures  which included tenant and vacant suite renovations and common area improvements at our commercial properties  roof replacements at our multifamily  retail and commercial properties and hvac replacements and access control system upgrades at our commercial and multifamily properties 
net cash flow used in investing activities was approximately  for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash flow provided by investing activities was approximately  the change from net cash flow provided in to net cash flow used in was primarily the result of cash payments in from nts private group s affiliates of approximately million for notes receivable related to inter company borrowings no similar payments received in  partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in additions to land  buildings and amenities in as compared to cash flow from financing activities net cash flow used in financing activities was approximately  for the year ended december  net cash flow provided by financing activities was approximately  for the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of  in loan proceeds obtained during the increase is partially offset by the payoff of the note payable of approximately  as well as principal payments incurred for each of our mortgages and notes payable 
for the years ended december  and  we used approximately  and  respectively  in net cash for financing activities 
the change was primarily the result of capital funding made as the result of the merger and cash payments made to nts private group s affiliates in of approximately million for notes payable related to inter company borrowings no similar payments made in  partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in principal payments on mortgages and notes payable in as compared to future liquidity our future liquidity depends significantly on our properties occupancy remaining at a level which provides for debt payments and adequate working capital  currently and in the future 
if occupancy were to fall below that level and remain at or below that level for a significant period of time  our ability to make payments due under our debt agreements and to continue paying daily operational costs would be greatly impaired 
in the next twelve months  we intend to operate the properties in a similar manner to their operation in recent years 
cash reserves  which consist of unrestricted cash as shown on our balance sheet  were approximately  on december  as part of the merger  we refinanced approximately million of debt with approximately million of new debt 
the refinancing  among other things  lowered interest rates and extended the amortization schedules 
the refinancing of this debt allowed us to generate cash flow to pay capital expenditures  principal and interest expenses from mortgages and notes payable  deferred fees and expenses to nts development company and quarterly distributions to our limited partners pursuant to our distribution policy 
we made quarterly distributions of per unit to our limited partners on may   july  and october  and a quarterly distribution of per unit to our limited partners on january  we do not anticipate a significant impact to our liquidity as a result of the vacancy at the sears office building and anthem office center 
however  the cost to lease these properties may be significant when a lease agreement with a tenant can be made 
we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million during february for the purchase of three multifamily properties  the grove at richland  the grove at whitworth  both located in nashville  tennessee and the grove at swift creek  located in chesterfield county  virginia 
this discussion of future liquidity  along with the table of contractual obligations and commercial commitments that follows  details our material commitments

additional sales of properties and financing will be required to purchase future properties 
there are significant and potentially material financial risks associated with our ability to execute certain transactions 
the sale and reinvestment are expected to qualify for the like kind exchange investment rules pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
we expect this to minimize any taxable gain to our unit holders as a result of the sale and reinvestment transactions

merger settlement charge nts realty was formed as part of a class action settlement where its affiliate and limited partner orig admitted a qualified settlement trust as a special member of orig 
this special member interest was created for the benefit of the class members in the litigation who are former limited partners who sold their limited partnership interests to orig  its affiliates or the partnerships either as part of tender offers  other repurchase programs or otherwise 
under the terms of orig s operating agreement  all of the economic and other rights associated with up to  units owned by orig have been designated for the benefit of the qualified settlement trust 
orig owns the units  but all of the rights associated with the units inures to the qualified settlement trust 
plaintiffs counsel  or his designee  will have the right  acting as a representative of these former limited partners  to cause orig to vote these designated units pursuant to his direction 
the amount of units was determined based on the million noncash amount of the million settlement amount agreed upon by the general partners and plaintiffs counsel 
therefore  if each unit is valued at  then the economic and other rights associated with  units will be needed to satisfy the settlement amount 
the final amount of the settlement  however  is based on the aggregate amount of valid claims filed by the former limited partners in the class of plaintiffs 
if claims are not made for the full million settlement amount  orig will designate the economic and other rights to fewer units for the benefit of the qualified settlement trust to satisfy the claims 
we refer to these designated units as the class units 
under the terms of the settlement agreement governing the qualified settlement trust  mr 
nichols  his spouse and mr 
lavin are jointly obligated  for a period of two years ending december   to repurchase from the qualified settlement trust  using of the distributions that orig receives in respect of the units owned by orig which otherwise would have gone to mr 
nichols  his spouse or mr 
lavin  the economic and other rights associated with the number of class units calculated under the formula described below 
each payment results in the redesignation of rights associated with the number of class units equal to the amount of the distribution divided by of the fair market value of the units 
as a result of each payment  the number of class units designated for the benefit of the qualified settlement trust will decrease until the economic and other rights associated with all of the class units are ultimately redesignated for the benefit of mr 
nichols  his spouse  and or mr 
lavin within two years of when we begin making distributions 
if any class units remain at the end of this two year period  mr 
nichols  his spouse and mr 
lavin must make a final payment to the qualified settlement trust that is sufficient to redesignate any remaining class units 
for these purposes  fair market value will be equal to the average closing price of the units on the american stock exchange for the thirty day period prior to the date of the redesignation 
our statement of operations includes a noncash charge in for our estimate related to the settlement with a corresponding credit to partners equity immediately following the completion of the merger 
the noncash charge was approximately million 
our earnings in were negatively impacted by this noncash charge 
however  there was no effect on our future liquidity because mr 
nichols  his spouse and mr 
lavin must make the payments to the qualified settlement trust to redesignate the class units as set forth above
