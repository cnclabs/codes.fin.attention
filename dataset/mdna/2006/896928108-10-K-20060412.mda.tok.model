overview tripos provides products and services to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and life science industries to support early stage research activities 
sales to the pharmaceutical industry represent of all new contracts sold during tripos offerings are applied principally to assist research chemists to make decisions about the most productive new compounds to make and test as potential therapeutics 
through its own chemistry laboratories  tripos can also make those compounds for its clients 
through strategic partnerships  tripos can also participate more directly with its clients in the development and testing of new therapeutic compounds for its clients 
the industries that tripos serves are highly research driven 
mature pharmaceutical companies typically spend between and of their annual revenues on research in the search for new blockbuster drugs 
this research process consists of several phases from early discovery of compounds of interest  through testing of the promising ones for activity and safety in animals  to final testing of these compounds in humans 
the investment in the research activity increases dramatically in the second and third phases of the research activity 
tripos offerings are most relevant to the initial phase of this activity 
our products and services are designed and intended to provide our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers with improved ways to identify and select the most promising drug candidates to take forward into the more expensive and time consuming stages of the drug development process 
depending on the number of compounds that a particular company has in different stages of their new therapeutic pipeline  they may reduce or increase investment in the other phases of research 
further  decisions by the pharmaceutical industry concerning their research investments are strongly influenced by decisions by the various governments of the world about drug pricing and regulation 
tripos software products are primarily sold on a renewable license basis  typically with terms of one to three years 
this business is generally predictable  as we have experienced high renewal rates in the past for licenses 
tripos management closely monitors license expirations and deploys sales staff to ensure the highest probability of renewals 
tripos service businesses  both informatics and chemistry  are much less predictable 
the sales cycles for these offerings are typically long from six months to eighteen months and are highly influenced by factors in the macro economic environment  including the general state of the pharmaceutical industry and the political situations in various parts of the world 
to forecast potential business in these areas  tripos management strives to closely interact with the management of our customers and is closely involved in business development activities for service projects 
large service contracts for pharmaceutical research  both informatics and chemistry  are complex and  because they are deployed in research applications where outcomes are uncertain  have a large risk component 
risk management in these projects begins with the definition of project requirements and continues through performance metrics and customer acceptance milestones 
due to the complexity of the projects and changing priorities within client organizations  it is typical that many decision points will arise that require management attention both at tripos and at the client 
to mitigate the project difficulties  tripos has developed a focused process in which management monitors milestones in the project plan according to the process workflow 
despite best efforts  however  some projects are of sufficient complexity that they present challenges that require revisions to the project plan and scope 
having been a public company spinout in with limited capital  we have focused on profitability and cashflow 
that said  we have not always been profitable  but have achieved profitability in certain years 
major investments  such as the recent expansion of our chemistry research laboratories in england  have been funded by other successful investments eg arena pharmaceuticals  cash from operations  temporary use of debt capacity  and grant funding from the british government 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we generate revenues from a diversified offering of products and services 
we derived of our revenues  of our revenues  and of our revenues from discovery informatics products and support  of   and revenues from discovery informatics services  and of revenues  of revenues  and of revenues from discovery research products and services 
the remainder is from hardware sales 
we license our discovery informatics products and post contract support pcs as either perpetual licenses or time based licenses  typically one to three year renewable contracts 
the magnitude of these license fees is dependent on each customer s required usage levels  that is  the number of locations and individual users 
variations in licensing levels range from the low hundred thousands up to several million dollars 
the following are descriptions of our current sales models for discovery software perpetual licenses software pricing is taken from our price list based on the quantity of individual modules and number of users 
customers are billed upon delivery 
revenue for software is recognized upon delivery of product and issuance of perpetual keys 
pcs is optional for each customer and is priced as a fixed percentage of the total current list price of the software purchased 
where applicable  pcs is typically billed annually 
the company has analyzed the other elements included in its multiple element arrangements involving perpetual licenses  and has determined it has sufficient vendor specific objective evidence vsoe to allocate revenues to pcs and or training 
vsoe for pcs and training is established based on the price charged when those elements are sold separately 
for pcs  this allocation amount is established based on the renewal rate specified in the arrangement  which is consistently priced at a percentage of the list price of the purchased licenses 
training is charged consistently from the company s price list 
bundled licenses time based bundled licenses are an alternative to perpetual licenses 
this type of license allows our customers to obtain multiple software products bundled with pcs that is co terminus with the period of the arrangement typically years 
a bundled license includes specific software modules and specified numbers of users of each module with all product and access keys delivered on or before the effective date of the contract 
tripos software is sold to professional users on an off the shelf basis in which the customer is responsible for installation 
these non cancelable  non refundable contracts are normally three years in duration although certain customers request shorter or longer contract periods 
at the end of the contract term  the customer must renew the license  or the software will cease to operate 
pcs  which includes unspecified updates  upgrades  and help desk services  is included in the total price of the contract 
the pcs provided under bundled arrangements is the same as that provided to customers under perpetual agreements 
bundled contract pricing is taken from our established price list includes package pricing and a la cart pricing that is based on the number of users and length of term 
all contracted products are delivered at inception 
if the customer should want additional modules  users  or license to any new software products  the customer must enter a new contract or addendum and pay the incremental fees to purchase these items 
software revenue and pcs revenues under bundled license agreements are recognized ratably over the contract period 
term licenses term licenses represent one year arrangements for a software product and one year of pcs 
the price is taken from the company s price list by product 
the support renewal fee is a fixed percentage of the software price similar to perpetual model 
the pcs provided for under term arrangements is the same as that provided to customers under perpetual agreements 
software and support pricing are separately stated and billed upon delivery of product 
to continue to operate the software  the customer must pay their annual renewal fee 
software revenue and pcs revenues under term license agreements are recognized ratably over the contract period 
our integration of chemistry and biological data in the life sciences industries creates a revenue opportunity for discovery informatics services software consulting 
to serve this market  we maintain a staff of specialists who use our proprietary data integration framework  such as metalayer  formsbuilder  smart idea  benchware notebook  chemcorerio and auspyx tm to configure customized solutions for data management 
revenue may be generated on a billable rate per day  or upon achievement of milestones or deliverables and is recognized as production activities are performed 
these contracts may also generate substantial license fee revenue for our proprietary software item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued technologies 
as with our discovery informatics products  licensing levels may range from the low hundred thousands up to the million dollar levels 
we develop and manufacture general screening compound libraries for sale to the life sciences industry for a fee per compound delivered 
in addition we offer our leaddiscovery libraries which include of higher value intellectual property rights such as patent applications 
these compounds and libraries have created the opportunity to offer follow up discovery research methods to customers for design and synthesis of focused libraries for lead optimization 
we also market a comprehensive research process to our life sciences customers for rapid and cost effective discovery 
this process combines advanced informatics  chemistry  and biology products and services  and proprietary discovery technologies for efficient lead development  refinement  and optimization resulting in a tightly integrated process to facilitate synergies in drug discovery 
in the past we have acted as a reseller of computer hardware 
hardware sales are generally made to facilitate our software customers access to hardware components and not a primary focus of our sales activities 
we act as an authorized reseller and only order hardware products on an as needed basis  and thus do not maintain any inventory 
we license discovery informatics tools to customers  provide ongoing support including upgrades selected by customers and provide informatics services to customers that enable integration of our existing and newly developed discovery tools to customers discovery operations 
we generally expense research and development costs associated with software enhancements and new functionality 
thus  a significant portion of the costs associated with development and enhancement of software is accounted for as research and development and not as a cost of software sales 
certain software development projects require substantial commitments of time and resources 
costs of these projects are capitalized upon achievement of technological feasibility and or a working model according to the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
quarterly expenses include the fixed costs of research and development for software development and new chemistry research 
we believe that core selling and administrative costs will remain generally consistent on an annual basis 
variability in quarterly expenses primarily occurs in relation to the level of revenues 
this is due to sales compensation  bonuses  staffing for selling  general and administrative functions and for periodic marketing activities such as appearances at trade exhibitions 
the relationship between the quarterly amounts presented for cost of sales or research and development expense may fluctuate based on the utilization of our employees on either billable contracts or research projects 
our revenues and expenses vary from quarter to quarter depending upon  among other things  the timing of customers budget processes  the success of our sales efforts  the lengthy sales cycle and our ability to influence customers and prospective customers to make decisions to outsource portions of their discovery process  the size of the customers capital expenditure budgets  the ability to produce compound libraries and achieve product release schedules including by tripos third party software providers and collaborators in a timely manner  the rate of market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of existing products  the timing of new product introductions by us and other vendors  changes in licensing and pricing policies ours  our partners and that of other vendors  consolidation in the customer base  client involvement in decision points in contracts related to project plans  our ability to accurately match contract costs to milestone or contract performance requirements on our larger collaborative arrangements  and changes in general economic  regulatory  and competitive conditions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of revenue recognition policies 
because much of our software license and pcs revenue along with our contracted discovery research revenue is recognized ratably over multiple periods  fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and earnings are caused principally by sales of compounds or by achievement of milestones on specific projects 
our management team monitors quarterly business activity with the aid of sales pipeline reports and monthly financial reports 
critical accounting policies the following information is provided in order to illustrate which accounting policies management deems to be the most critical in the computation of the financial statements included later in this form k 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
by the nature of the accounts  our critical accounting policies usually involve a higher degree of management judgment 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued revenue recognitionthe following are the revenue recognition policies for each of our offerings discovery informatics products and support the company recognizes revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized when each of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph of sop persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
the company allocates revenues on perpetual software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on the relative fair values of each element 
the company s determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company limits its assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately by the company 
the company has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple element arrangements and determined that it has sufficient vsoe to allocate revenues to maintenance and support services  and training 
the company sells training separately and has established vsoe on this basis 
vsoe for maintenance and support is determined based upon the renewal rates in contracts themselves  which is based on a fixed percentage of the current perpetual license list price 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenues from perpetual licenses are recognized upon delivery of the software using the residual method in accordance with sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
revenues from perpetual software license sales fluctuate based on the size and number of transactions completed during any fiscal period 
software maintenance agreements provide technical support and the right to unspecified enhancements and upgrades on a when and if available basis 
post contract customer support revenues on perpetual agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the support period generally one year  and training and other service revenues are recognized as the related services are provided 
any unrecognized portion of amounts paid or billed in advance for licenses and services is recorded as deferred revenue 
revenues from post contract support are derived from sales to new customers and renewals from existing customers 
historical renewal rates have averaged in excess of 
term and bundled licenses represent time based license arrangements for one or multiple software products that are sold with maintenance and support for the term of the license arrangement 
the company does not have vsoe to determine fair value of the maintenance and support in term arrangements 
the company recognizes revenues from these bundled time based licenses ratably over the license term  which is typically to years 
revenues from time base license arrangements are derived from sales to new customers and renewals from existing customers 
historical renewal rates have averaged over the past three years 
discovery informatics services discovery informatics services dis represents contracts for the development and delivery of enterprise wide customized software such as laboratory information systems or database integration projects 
technological feasibility exists on these software arrangements and they typically include installation at the customer s site 
we account for these arrangements in accordance with sop  as required by sop since the contract to deliver software and installation requires significant production  modification or customization of software 
in applying the provisions of sop the percentage of completion is utilized 
for contracts where customer approval of contractually required tasks must occur at each distinct milestone  and where amounts billable are indicative of progress to completion  we record revenues when a milestone has been met and accepted by the customer 
for contracts without distinct milestones  we measure progress using the cost to cost method cumulative costs as a percentage of total expected costs to complete  which approximates progress towards completion 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued dis also includes software development sd projects that are contractual arrangements with customers for use of tripos software developers in an effort to develop a scientific software tool for use in drug discovery 
the contractual arrangements are on a commercially reasonable basis  and the customer is subject to billings on a time and materials basis 
accordingly  we record the related revenue when the time and costs are incurred at the stated contractual rates 
discovery research products and services discovery research sales include sales of chemical compounds from inventory  long term contracts to design and produce chemical compounds to customer specifications  or contracts to perform discovery research activities 
tripos recognizes revenue from the sale of chemical compounds upon shipment of the products  fob shipping point  to the customer 
this practice is consistent with the four criteria required for revenue recognition listed in paragraph of staff accounting bulletin sab issued by the us securities and exchange commission sec 
for chemical compound transactions  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists upon the receipt of a contract outlining the purchase and usage terms of the compounds 
a purchase order may also be received as confirmation 
as stated above  revenue is not recognized until the compounds have been shipped to the customer 
the selling price for compounds is fixed according to the terms of the contract or customer s purchase order 
payment terms for chemical compound transactions are net days 
the company has experienced very few bad debts arising from these product transactions  as a result  collectibility is reasonably assured 
in accordance with sop  sales derived from long term contracts to design and produce chemical compounds to customer specifications are recorded using the percentage of completion method as the compounds are delivered under the units of delivery method 
the contract costs related to delivered compounds are recorded to cost of sales as the compounds are delivered and revenue is recognized 
discovery research activities involve lead compound optimization projects  custom synthesis  and compound design 
these contracts generally call for non refundable contractual fees tied to time and materials 
accordingly  revenues under contracts of this type are recorded on a time and material basis 
when contracts to perform discovery research activities require a specific deliverable  the direct and incremental contract costs are deferred 
revenue and the contract costs are then recorded upon delivery and acceptance 
an access fee for our leaddiscovery programs is recognized upon completion of a materials transfer agreement and shipment of selected compounds to the customer for screening purposes 
should the customer decide to retain exclusive rights to promising compounds in the selection  an additional fee is required 
customers may engage tripos for discovery research services to further refine the lead compound for additional fees 
hardware sales hardware sales are recorded upon delivery unless delivered in connection with a contractual arrangement involving term or bundled software licenses 
when hardware is sold in conjunction with a term or bundled license  the entire contractual revenue amount is recognized ratably over the term or bundled software license period and the related hardware costs are deferred and recorded in cost of sales ratably over the same period 
valuation of accounts receivabledue to the nature and credit quality of our customer base principally major pharmaceutical companies  universities and larger biotechnology companies  provision for bad debts is typically calculated on a case by case basis and takes into consideration the age of the outstanding receivable amount by customer  the customer s cash position  and the geographic location of the customer 
historically  we have a very low experience rate of uncollectible amounts 
management believes that alternative methods for calculating allowances for bad debts such as percentage of net sales or percentage of past due receivables do not reflect our lower experience rates and thus that the specific identification method is more appropriate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts and make adjustments in the periods any excess or shortfall is identified 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued software development costscosts related to new products are capitalized after the establishment of technological feasibility working model in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
amortization of capitalized software development costs is provided on a product by product basis as the greater of a the ratio of current gross revenues for a product to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues or b the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
currently  we use an estimated economic life of three to five years for all capitalized software development costs 
we assess the recoverability of capitalized software development costs by comparing the remaining unamortized balance to the net realizable value of the related product 
any excess is written off 
these write offs could be significant if we are unable to penetrate a market with a new product or experience a decline in revenues from older capitalized products 
capitalization and valuation of chemical compound costsinitial costs to develop our leadquest compounds chemical compounds for sale for use in drug discovery are categorized as research and development expense until such time it becomes probable that a saleable library can be successfully produced 
therefore  costs for design  research  and analytical procedures for every library of compounds are expensed as incurred 
our research chemists review the results of analytical procedures to determine if the chemical reactions completed as expected and the product purity and product yields are within acceptable tolerances 
this validation process determines whether the chemistry is successful and if a saleable product will result 
we capitalize costs to inventory once the validation process is completed and successful production is reasonably assured 
if the core reaction is unsuccessful  the library template is abandoned and no further development takes place 
similarly  we capitalize the costs of leaddiscovery packages once we are reasonably assured of the success of the underlying chemistry 
after this point we capture the costs of labor  chemicals and screening activity into work in process inventory 
should a leaddiscovery library not reach its full potential as a standalone offering  we can utilize the products within discovery research contracts for customers or in our leadquest compound library 
inventory amounts shown in the consolidated balance sheet are net of an obsolescence reserve 
in calculating the reserve for inventory held for sale  the age and sales trends of each category in the inventory are taken into account to determine the net realizable value 
any shortfall between the carrying cost of the inventory and the net realizable value is provided for in the reserve 
a portion of the leadquest inventory is used in discovery research projects 
this portion of the inventory asset is depreciated over its year expected useful life 
property  plant and equipmentall assets reflected under this category on our balance sheet are held for use in the operations of tripos 
due to the fast paced development of new technologies in computer hardware and laboratory equipment  we closely monitor the original life expectancies of new purchases and set our depreciation or amortization rates accordingly to best match the economic useful life of the asset 
assets or equipment that are no longer of use to the organization are written down to their realizable value and then disposed 
income taxestripos computes income taxes using the asset and liability method prescribe by statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes 
the primary difference between financial statement income and taxable income results from the use of different methods of computing depreciation  capitalized development costs  and other timing differences 
the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate primarily due to the impact of research and development credits  which are subject to interpretation of us federal tax regulations  and the change in valuation allowance related to net operating loss carry forwards 
our methodology for recording income taxes requires a significant amount of judgment in the use of assumptions and estimates 
additionally  we use forecasts of certain tax elements such as taxable income and foreign tax credit utilization  as well as evaluate the feasibility of implementing tax planning strategies 
given the inherent uncertainty involved with the use of such variables  there can be significant variation between anticipated and actual results 
unforeseen events may significantly impact these variables  and changes to these variables could have a material impact on our income tax accounts 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued goodwill and other intangible assets 
the costs of acquired companies are allocated first to their identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair values 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed  is recorded as goodwill and is subject to impairment tests at least annually as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
if the impairment tests indicate that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss would be required to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in an amount equal to the excess carrying value 
in performing our impairment tests  the estimated fair value was based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and discount rates are often subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as economic trends and government regulations  and internal factors such as changes in our forecasts or in our business strategies 
we believe the assumptions used in our impairment analysis are reasonable and appropriate  however  different assumptions and estimates could affect the results of our impairment analysis and in turn result in an impairment charge 
if an impairment loss should occur in the future  it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
the following information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of net sales  except costs of sales data  which is set forth as a percentage of the corresponding net sales data net sales discovery informatics products support discovery informatics services discovery research products services hardware total net sales cost of sales discovery informatics products support discovery informatics services discovery research products services hardware total cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative restructuring charge total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense  net net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss preferred dividends net income loss as a percentage of the corresponding sales item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net sales 
total net sales decreased to million in from million in  which was up over the million recorded in the decrease in was primarily attributable to lower levels of production on the four year million strategic compound file enrichment and hit follow up contract with pfizer which was successfully completed during the fourth quarter of and lower compound sales  all related to our discovery research business 
in addition our informatics services business experienced a decrease in revenues of million in compared to  primarily due to the completion of a multi year project with schering ag along with smaller active projects in discovery informatics products and support increased or  in the overall increases in compared to were the result of higher revenues in discovery software products and support in along with higher discovery research activity up in principally due to the pfizer contract to design and synthesize chemical compounds 
our discovery informatics service revenues grew in by 
the growth in discovery informatics service revenues was primarily due to the successful delivery of milestones on existing contracts  including our contract with schering ag 
discovery informatics service is discussed in more detail below 
we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from the pharmaceutical industry 
new sales to this industry accounted for approximately  and  of total new sales in   and  respectively 
net sales from our activities outside of north america represented approximately  and of total net sales in  and  respectively  with europe accounting for  and  and the remainder coming from customers in the pacific rim 
we believe that revenues from foreign activities will continue to account for a significant percentage of our total net sales  however  with the conclusion of the pfizer project  we expect european business to be closer to of total revenues in the near term 
software license sales in japan for and through the second quarter were adversely impacted by an injunction issued by a japanese court against tripos local distributor that prevented it from selling a certain third party software product that is an optional module within the tripos offerings 
more recently  the adverse effect of this ruling has been mitigated through the introduction of what we believe to be a non infringing version of this software 
list prices for our software products have had only modest price increases and have therefore remained relatively stable over the last few years 
due to the competitive nature of the software market in which we sell  we expect that price increases for our more established products will remain moderate for the foreseeable future 
increasing net sales from period to period is dependent  in part  on our ability to introduce new products and services  which are accepted by the market  and on our ability to penetrate new and existing markets 
sales to existing customers have represented over of total revenues during each of the last three years  with sales to existing customers being 
total discovery informatics product and support sales increased to million from million in which was up from s million 
the majority of our software licenses are time based from which the corresponding revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the length of each license term typically to years 
revenue recognition from time based software license arrangements will normally stretch into subsequent periods depending on the length of individual contract terms 
as an illustration  the software revenue deferred from non cancelable contracts initiated in recent fiscal years that will be recognized in and thereafter is projected to be over million 
the table presented in note time based software license arrangements presents the total amounts of deferred revenues from non cancelable time based software license arrangements 
our discovery informatics service activities have been significantly impacted by the overall slow down in spending for products and services offered by firms such as us by the pharmaceutical industry in recent years 
of late  the industry started to show signs of recovery in its outsource spending activity in terms of new projects being put out for bid 
discovery informatics service revenues decreased in by to million after increasing by in to million from million in the reduction in revenues is attributable to the timing and size of ongoing projects in the current year 
the timing of revenue recognition from discovery informatics services is typically subject to achievement of contractual milestones and thus varies from period to period 
the increase in was principally due to progress on our amended contract with schering ag 
at the end of  tripos and schering were in talks regarding the specifications and financial arrangements necessary to complete the development and deployment of the production version of the agreed technology scheduled for mid changes in the scope and funding required a change to the then existing contract 
because these discussions were not finalized as of december   we made an adjustment of  to reduce the revenue recognized up to that point from our contract with schering 
in calculating the amount of the adjustment to be recorded in  tripos assumed that the project would not continue past delivery and rollout of the production system in mid item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued this assumption led to a corresponding reduction of approximately  in the total revenues available under the contract through that mid delivery date 
tripos was required to make this adjustment to revenues so that its financial statements fairly reflected the project status and contractual terms as of december  in mid  tripos and schering agreed on an amendment to the contract that would provide funding to cover functionality and time that were not anticipated in the original contract for full implementation of this project 
during and  tripos achieved the agreed milestones and realized the incremental revenues 
we derive discovery research revenues from our compound library product  leadquest  and discovery research activities 
discovery research revenues decreased to million in from million in  which was higher than the million recognized in the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to lower levels of production as the four year million strategic compound file enrichment and hit follow up contract with pfizer moved toward completion in late this decline was coupled with lower compound sales that were partially offset by incremental discovery research activities with new customers 
as previously disclosed  revenues from pfizer were expected to be lower in than as the project came to completion 
discovery research revenues from pfizer were million in compared to million in other discovery research activities increased in to million from million in as capacity increased to take on new business 
the primary reason for the increased revenue in compared to was the growth in production levels on the pfizer contract 
the pfizer project plan called for a ramp up in the production and delivery of the custom compounds to their peak in revenue related to discovery research activities is recognized in accordance with sop  under the percentage of completion method using an output measure for revenue recognition units of delivery method 
hardware revenues declined in to  from  in  which was down compared to the  in the high end server and workstation equipment that we historically sold to our customers continues to face growing competition from lower cost alternatives 
we do not aggressively promote hardware due to its low margin  but rather only facilitate customer demand when required 
cost of sales 
total cost of sales decreased to million in  down from s million  which in turn was up from million in these costs represent  and of total net sales  respectively 
costs of discovery informatics products and support represented  and of software license and support sales in  and  respectively 
costs of software products and support consist of amortization of software products acquired in the optive acquisition  amortization of capitalized software  product royalties to third party developers  commissions to pacific rim distributors  the cost of software product packaging and media  the costs related to staffing telephone support functions  packaging for updates upgrades  and updates to documentation 
staffing costs are expected to increase in future periods at or near the rates of cost of living increases 
included in the and cost of sales was a write down in the carrying cost of our chemcorerio software asset of million and  respectively 
we analyzed the net realizable value of the asset based on our assessment of the market for the product given our current investment in sales and marketing for it  and determined that a reduction in the amount capitalized was appropriate in spite of our belief that it is a valuable asset for future development 
in addition  the costs of sales include  of amortization expense related to software products acquired in the january acquisition of optive research 
cost of sales as a percent to software sales has increased over the past few years due to a change in the mix of internal versus third party products sold  thus resulting in higher royalty payments 
the effective rate of royalties may continue to fluctuate in future periods 
costs of discovery informatics services dis represented  and of discovery informatics service revenues in  and  respectively 
costs of dis are direct charges for staff  travel and overhead required to develop custom software solutions for clients 
cost of dis exceeded revenues because of a charge for anticipated losses under our contract with schering ag 
as stated above in the discussion of dis revenues  tripos was involved in negotiations with schering to amend the specifications and financial arrangements necessary to complete the development and deployment of the production version of the previously agreed technology 
because these discussions were not finalized by the end of  tripos recorded a charge of approximately  for the estimated project costs in excess of the total project revenues that remained under the original contract terms 
in calculating the amount of the charge to be recorded  tripos was required to utilize the then existing contract terms  and could not assume that the project would continue past delivery and rollout of the production system in mid tripos was required to record the excess costs so that its year end financial statements fairly reflected the project status as of december  during  the parties agreed on a revision to the scope of functionality and an incremental amount of funding to cover completion of the project 
tripos successfully achieved the agreed milestones for and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued costs of discovery research products and services represented  and of discovery research sales in  and  respectively 
the cost of the discovery research business is represented by the raw material  direct labor and overhead costs to produce compound libraries and to deliver on contracted research projects 
discovery research contracts may also include third party costs for production of larger quantities of intermediate or scale up materials 
as a result  variability in cost of sales may be attributed to the mix of compound products and discovery research revenues 
the increase in the cost of discovery research products and services as a percentage of sales is due to production inefficiencies incurred in the winding down of the four year strategic compound file enrichment and hit follow up contract with pfizer as well as additional provisions of approximately  incurred on our leadquest libraries as we performed a re analysis of all compounds during the levels of cost of sales of discovery research activities in and are primarily attributable to production under the pfizer compound design and synthesis contract 
a significant component of cost of sales from to early was outsourcing required to successfully deliver against the contract  combined with the financial impact of the decline of the us dollar against the great britain pound sterling where our operation is based 
see the discussion of discovery research revenues above for additional information on this contract 
although our reliance on outsourcing was essentially eliminated by the end of thus allowing for better control over costs and efficiency  we continue to experience the effects of the further decline in the value of the us dollar that adversely impacted margins 
costs of hardware represented   and of hardware sales in  and  respectively 
cost of sales for hardware consists of the direct costs to us of the equipment sold 
gross profit was million in  million in and million in  which represents gross margin of  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin in is primarily attributable to the increase in the effective rate of royalties on discovery informatics products  the write down of million taken on our chemcore rio capitalized software asset  increased costs of production as a percentage of revenues on our pfizer contract in discovery research  and additional provisions in the current year as we performed the re analysis of our leadquest libraries 
the decrease in gross margin in compared to is attributable to the increase in the effective rate of royalties on discovery informatics products  the ramp up on the pfizer compound file enrichment project and the write down of  for the chemcorerio capitalized software asset 
gross profit for the company is dependent on the mix of discovery research versus discovery informatics business  the costs of chemical materials and overhead  the mix of internal versus third party software product sales  foreign exchange rates and the company s ability to successfully deliver on informatics contracts 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in  which was a decrease of from million in sales and marketing expenses represented  and of   and total net sales  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses of million during is primarily attributable to lower employee costs from open positions  lower commissions  and lower travel expense totaling million 
the expiration of certain consulting relationships and lower marketing expenses totaled  during  we realized expense savings in the sales and marketing organization due to open or eliminated positions  estimated at  research and development expenses increased in to million from the million in  which was down from million in r d costs represented   and of net sales in  and  respectively 
the increase in r d expenses in the current year is almost entirely attributable to inefficiencies associated with completing the pfizer contract in december as scientific staff was assigned to non billable research as well as additional non capitalizable costs related to our leaddiscovery program in the amount of  the inefficiencies are attributable to less than optimal production quantities as the pfizer work wound down along with the generation of redundant staff 
as previously disclosed  in december we announced that we had initiated a day consultation period as mandated by uk law to complete a reduction in force for our discovery research business based in bude  england 
we initiated this action to streamline our discovery research business and associated cost structure as a result of our successful completion of the four year million file enrichment project with pfizer in the fourth quarter of we subsequently completed this process in january  reducing our workforce by positions with an estimated cost of million to be taken as a restructuring charge in the first quarter of research and development costs in our discovery item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued informatics segment included million of software development that was capitalized 
the reduced level of r d expense in compared to reflects more scientific costs charged to cost of sales for the pfizer and other discovery research contracts  redeployment of our discovery informatics personnel to work on software product development resulting in the capitalization of software development costs  for our new benchware discovery informatics products  inventoried costs of our new leaddiscovery chemistry packages million  and reduced headcount in our discovery informatics group 
the benchware and leaddiscovery products were released to the market in the latter part of research and development expenses  including the amount of capitalized costs were million in  million in  and million in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the company capitalizes software development costs for external use 
tripos anticipates that its investment in new product research will continue to be significant as we develop new software modules each year  work on funded software research contracts with customers  develop new technologies for use in our informatics consulting work  and pursue novel compound templates for inclusion in our leadquest and leaddiscovery libraries 
costs associated with investigating novel compound templates are classified as r d up until such time as the base reaction is validated  after which costs are captured in inventory 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from the million in which was up from the million in g a expenses represented  and of net sales for  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues in was attributable to lower sales volumes in while costs decreased slightly by  increased g a expenses for are primarily the result of legal fees that were subject to the deductible under our insurance policy to defend against the class action lawsuit  and costs to document and test internal controls for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of 
we expect general and administrative spending to remain relatively stable  but will fluctuate as a percentage of sales 
restructuring expenses in represents an impairment charge related to a temporary laboratory building at our discovery research center 
during december  we completed our four year million file enrichment contract with pfizer 
with the completion of the pfizer contract  this temporary building was no longer needed for production activity 
we do not expect that the building would be saleable in its present condition and alterations to qualify for permanent treatment with the local authorities would not have increased the market value 
as such  we recorded an impairment loss related to this building in the amount of k  reducing the net carrying value to zero 
in addition  as discussed above in research and development expenses  we expect to take a million charge in the first quarter of as a result of a reduction in force at our discovery research business that was initiated in december of and subsequently completed in january see additional discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income was  in   in and  in the reduction from the level reflects a decreasing average amount of cash on hand due to lower levels of cash generated from operations in and the reduction of outstanding debt in interest expense of million in  million in and  in was from interest due on the long term note payable for the corporate building  interest due on our line of credit  interest costs associated with our capital leases and interest in related to the subordinated note issued in the acquisition of optive research 
in january  we issued a million subordinated promissory note with a stated interest rate of as part of consideration in the optive acquisition 
interest expense associated with the subordinated debt totaled  in interest expense has varied commensurate with the change in average outstanding debt balances to finance the expansion of the uk chemistry lab in and to acquire optive research in the floating rate incurred by the company on the mortgage note averaged in and in the interest rate incurred on our line of credit was in and in interest rates on our capital leases range from to 
other income expense was  in   in and million in in we sold our  shares of nuvasive  inc realizing a gain of  along with net gains of  on our investment in the am pappas life science ii fund 
these gains in are offset by million of currency losses due to the strength of the us dollar against european currencies  offsetting gains realized in recent years 
early in we sold the last of our holdings of arena pharmaceuticals  inc arena common stock and realized a gain of  the remainder of the other income was from foreign currency gains realized by our european subsidiaries 
other income included a million pre tax gain on the sale of just under million shares of arena 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in addition  the company benefited from a  gain on the mark to market of a series of foreign exchange hedges that fixed the rate of us dollars to british pounds 
also  due to the weakness of the us dollar  our european subsidiaries recorded currency exchange gains of approximately million 
income tax expense benefit 
our tax expense benefit was million in  million in and million in the effective tax rates were  and for  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for  and reflect management s current estimate of the distribution of earnings among the statutory jurisdictions in which we operate and the valuation of certain tax credits and net operating losses in the us and us for those tax years each ending december 
the high tax rate in results from taxes accrued in certain jurisdictions that were not mitigated by the benefit of losses in other jurisdictions at that time 
the tax benefit recorded in reflects the value of r d tax credits claimed in the uk for through that we were not able to record until it became more likely than not that the credits would be allowed 
these credits effectively offset the prior years taxes due in the uk resulting in net deferred tax assets 
these excess deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance 
the establishment of the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets does not impair our ability to use the deferred tax assets upon achieving profitability in the related jurisdictions 
upon the recognition of income in future periods in the jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets were created  release of the corresponding valuation allowances may result in a lower effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
net cash provided from operating activities was million 
cash was generated by reconciled net income of million consisting of a net loss of million plus the add back of non cash depreciation and amortization including the amortization of debt discount totaling million  the add back of write down of impaired investment and impairment charge on building of million and million  respectively  the deduction of gains from the sale of marketable securities of million  and a change in the deferred tax benefit of million 
in addition cash was generated by a reduction in inventory of million and in accounts receivable totaling million 
these increases in cash were partially offset by a decrease in deferred revenues of million and decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
inventory  accounts receivable and deferred revenues were all reduced in due to the completion of pfizer contract in december amortization for included a million charge for the write down of the carrying value of our chemcorerio software asset to its expected net realizable value

inventory was reduced in due to sale of more quantities of chemical products and reduced production time on the pfizer contract 
s lower level of accounts receivable reflects a change in the invoice timing of a significant informatics contract compared to depreciation commenced early in upon the completion and fit out of our uk laboratory leading to the higher levels compared to prior years 
amortization for included million for the write down of the carrying value of our chemcorerio software asset to its expected net realizable value

in addition  we excluded the effect of gains on sales of shares of arena pharmaceuticals of million and the appreciation in our foreign currency forward contracts of million 
depreciation expense has grown over the past two years as a result of our capital investments in the tripos discovery research laboratories 
inventory levels peaked in related to our delivery commitments to pfizer

over the next to months  we may be asked to fund the remainder of our investment commitment million to the am pappas life science ii fund 
in april  the company and lasalle bank executed an amendment to the existing credit facility that increased the revolving credit portion of the facility by million to million and provided for a maturity date of april  of the credit facility portion 
also  the maturity date on the mortgage portion of the facility was extended from december to april the credit facility required us to meet certain financial covenants  including minimum debt service coverage  minimum shareholders equity  maximum capital expenditure excluding the chemistry laboratory expansion and an annual clean down period of consecutive days in which no borrowings are outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
at december   we had borrowings outstanding of million on the line of credit that were included in short term debt 
at december  we were not in compliance with certain covenants of our re volving credit facility  including the minimum debt service coverage and minimu m shareholders equity 
we obtained waivers from lasalle bank for the period endi ng december  lasalle bank has provided the company with a commitment to extend this facility to january   decrease its commitment to million  eliminate the annual clean down requirement  implement a borrow ing base on domestic and insured foreign accounts receivable plus million of excess equity in us real estate  a revised minimum shareholders equity co venant tested quarterly and a minimum consolidated cash balance covenant tested month ly 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and resu lts of operations continued we are currently in the process of documenting this amendment and extension  which we expect will be concluded promptly 
we expect to fund prospective operating needs and capital expenditures through cash from operations and other resources that become available to us 
we believe that with our cash  accounts receivable balances  projected cash flows from operations  access to available borrowings from lasalle bank under the amendment described above and future extensions which we intend to pursue prior to the january  maturity  incremental capital leases  and potential other capital sources  if any  we will be able to meet our liquidity and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
although we have taken steps intended to better align our operating costs to our expected revenues as a result of the completion of our four year pfizer contract  our working capital could be adversely affected if we are not entirely successful in these efforts 
however  we expect that our capital expenditure requirements will be substantially lower than in recent years due to the complet ion of our chemistry laboratory expansion 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our credit facilities 
despite current capital markets uncertainties  we believe that it may be prudent for us to seek additional financing to support our objectives to enhance product development  expand existing markets and enter new markets  enhance our capital base for other purposes  and diversify our working capital resources beyond those provided by lasalle bank 
in making decisions regarding access to additional capital  we would consider the availability and terms of financing alternatives  and the expected financial impact of any financing  including any near term dilutive impact  that we might incur in pursuit of our objective to maintain financial flexibility to support planned and opportunistic growth of our business and the ongoing consideration of our strategic objectives 
additional capital may be in the form of equity or debt securities  and may be raised in public offering or private placement transactions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s our exposure to market risks is limited to foreign exchange variances and fluctuations in interest rates 
to date  interest rate exposure has not resulted in a material impact 
during  and  the company did experience a significant impact from foreign exchange 
the costs to perform the custom design and synthesis contract with pfizer are incurred in british pounds sterling while we are compensated in us dollars for much of the work 
as a result  our gross profit was adversely affected by the decline in the us dollar against the pound 
part of this effect was offset through foreign currency forward contracts whose gains were recorded in other income 
our foreign exchange risk is presently limited to currencies that historically have exhibited only minor fluctuations although from through  these currencies have shown more significant variation 
assets outside the united states subject to currency fluctuation are located in england  germany and france 
our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are not hedged 
the assets in foreign subsidiaries most susceptible to exchange rate variances were as follows us dollar uk pound balances million  million and us dollar euro balances million  million  respectively 
the potential reduction in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in us dollar uk pound currency exchange rates would be approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  while the same adverse movement in the us dollar euro rates would be approximately   and  for and year ends  respectively 
any loss in fair value of permanently invested funds would be reflected in other comprehensive income and would not impact our net income 
our interest rate risk is attributable to borrowings under the line of credit and mortgage loan 
we monitor our exposure to floating interest rate risk on line of credit borrowings along with the outstanding balance on the mortgage loan and may  at times  endeavor to mitigate this risk through the use of appropriate hedging instruments
