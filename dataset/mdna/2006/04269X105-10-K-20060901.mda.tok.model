item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements about our expectations related to the success of our internal proprietary drug discovery activities  realizing new revenue streams and obtaining future collaboration agreements that include milestone and or royalty payments  our ability to realize such milestone and royalty payments under our existing or any future agreements  future research and development spending  our working capital requirements and our future headcount requirements 
these statements involve significant risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and those described more fully under the caption risk factors above and in other reports filed by array biopharma with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
overview array biopharma is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of targeted small molecule drugs to treat life threatening and debilitating diseases 
our proprietary drug development pipeline is primarily focused on the treatment of cancer and inflammatory disease and includes clinical candidates that are designed to regulate therapeutically important targets 
in addition  leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies collaborate with array to discover and develop drug candidates across a broad range of therapeutic areas 
we have identified multiple drug candidates in our own proprietary programs and in collaborations with other drug companies 
we intend to progress our proprietary drug programs internally through clinical testing and continue to evaluate select programs for out licensing opportunities with pharmaceutical and biotechnology partners 
we have built our drug development pipeline and our discovery and development capabilities  primarily through cash flow from collaborations and through sales of our equity securities 
through june   we have recognized million in collaboration revenue  and we have received million in up front payments and million in milestone payments from our collaborators and out licensing partners 
under our existing collaboration agreements  we have the potential to earn over million in additional milestone payments if we achieve all of the drug discovery objectives  as well as royalties on any resulting product sales  from different programs under these agreements 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the near future as we continue to invest in our proprietary drug discovery programs 
as of june   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
revenue 
we generate revenue through the out licensing of select proprietary drug discovery programs for license and up front fees  research funding based on the number of our full time equivalent scientists performing research on the program  and research and development milestone payments 
we also have the potential to generate revenue from royalties on future product sales 
four programs have been out licensed to date to astrazeneca plc  genentech  inc and amgen inc  and we have received up front license fees of million in total for these programs 
we also generate revenue through collaborations aimed at inventing drug candidates for our collaborators 
we receive research funding based on the number of our full time equivalent scientists performing research on the program  plus related research expenses 
under certain of these agreements  we are entitled to receive additional payments based on the achievement of research milestones  drug development milestones and or royalty payments based on sales of products created as a result of these collaborations 
we sell our optimer building blocks  which are the starting materials used to create more complex chemical compounds in the drug discovery process  on a per compound basis without any restrictions on use 
in addition  we have licensed our lead generation libraries  which are a collection of structurally related chemical compounds that may have the potential of becoming drug candidates  on a non exclusive basis to our collaborators for their internal research purposes 
we no longer develop new lead generation libraries other than for our own proprietary research and expect future revenue from sales of compounds in our lead generation libraries to continue to be insignificant 
we report revenue for lead generation and lead optimization research  custom synthesis and process research  the development and sale of chemical compounds and the co development of proprietary drug candidates we out license  as collaboration revenue 
license and milestone revenue is combined and reported separately from collaboration revenue 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from fees under our collaboration agreements on a monthly basis as work is performed 
per compound revenue is recognized as compounds are shipped 
revenue from license fees and up front fees is recognized on a straight line basis over the expected period of the related research program 
payments received in advance of performance are recorded as advance payments from collaborators until the revenue is earned 
milestone payments are non refundable and are recognized as revenue over the expected period of the related research program 
a portion of each milestone payment is recognized when the milestone is achieved based on the applicable percentage of the research term that has elapsed 
any balance is recognized ratably over the remaining research term 
revenue recognition related to license fees  up front payments and milestone payments could be accelerated in the event of early termination of programs 
customer concentration 
our top collaborators contributed approximately of our total revenue during fiscal  and our current top three collaborators  genentech  intermune  and astrazeneca  accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
during fiscal year these same collaborators accounted for  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
in general  certain of our collaborators may terminate their collaboration agreements with us on to days prior notice  including our agreement with genentech which can be terminated on days notice 
international revenue 
international revenue represented of our total revenue during fiscal year  down from for the same period in the prior year 
our international revenue is primarily attributable to european and japanese collaborations 
international revenue decreased during fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to the expiration of the research funding period of the astrazeneca collaboration in november this decrease was partially offset by increased revenue generated from a new japanese research collaboration with ono pharmaceutical co  ltd 
in november all of our collaboration agreements are denominated in united states dollars 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue represents research and development conducted for our collaborators and the cost of chemical compounds sold from our inventory 
these costs consist mainly of compensation  associated fringe benefits and other collaboration related costs  including supplies  small tools  facilities  depreciation  recruiting and relocation and other direct and indirect chemical handling and laboratory support costs 
fine chemicals consumed as well as any required inventory reserve adjustments are also recorded as cost of revenue 
we review the levels and values of our chemical inventories periodically and  when required  write down the carrying cost of our inventories for non marketability to estimated net realizable value through an appropriate reserve 
research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery 
research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery consists of all costs associated with our proprietary drug development pipeline  including compensation and fringe benefits  consulting and outsourced services  laboratory supplies  and allocated facility costs and depreciation 
when an internal proprietary program is out licensed  all subsequent costs of the out licensed program are reported as cost of revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist mainly of compensation and associated fringe benefits not included in cost of revenue or research and development expenses and include other management  business development  accounting  information technology and administration costs  including patent prosecution  recruiting and relocation  consulting and professional services  travel and meals  advertising  sales commissions  facilities  depreciation and other office expenses 
business development 
we currently license our compounds and enter into collaborations directly with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through opportunities identified by our business development group  senior management  scientists and customer referrals 
in addition  we license our compounds and enter into collaborations in japan through an agent 
future outlook 
we plan to increase our investment in proprietary research to broaden our product pipeline and to further enhance our clinical and regulatory capabilities to allow us to advance drugs further in clinical development 
we will consider commercializing select programs ourselves with appropriate market characteristics while continuing to evaluate out licensing opportunities to maximize the risk adjusted return of our proprietary programs 
as part of these efforts  we expect near term selling  general and administrative costs to rise in connection with increased patent and other intellectual property related costs incurred to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights in our proprietary programs and research and development for proprietary drug discovery costs to rise in connection with building our clinical and regulatory capabilities 
as we devote more scientists to our proprietary research  we expect fewer scientists will be assigned to revenue generating collaborations 
because of our strategy to retain other proprietary programs until later in clinical development before out licensing them or commercializing them ourselves  we may not recognize significant revenue from new out licensing opportunities in the near term 
our statements about future events in this paragraph are subject to many risks and uncertainties  including many that are beyond our control 
these risks are described more fully under the caption risk factors included herein and in other reports filed by array biopharma with the securities and exchange commission 
results of operations fiscal years ended june   and revenue years ended june  increase decrease to to in thousands collaboration revenue license and milestone revenue total revenue fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue for fiscal decreased from due to a decrease in license and milestone revenue of million  which was offset by improvements in collaboration revenue totaling million 
the improvement in collaboration revenue was the result of increased revenue  totaling million  from expanded programs with intermune and genentech and a new research collaboration with ono pharmaceutical 
this increase was partially offset by decreased collaboration revenue of million related to research programs that expired in fiscal with eli lilly and company  and qlt inc  as well as the research program with astrazeneca that expired in november additionally  collaboration revenue from the sale of lead generation libraries decreased during the year by million  due to the sale of the remainder of our lead generation library compounds to a single collaborator during fiscal all previously received license fee and milestone payments from astrazeneca and genentech were fully recognized in november resulting in a decrease in recognized revenue from the prior year of million 
partially offsetting this decrease was the recognition of million of milestone payments received from astrazeneca during the current fiscal year related to advancing arry into phase b clinical trials and the selection of two additional drug candidates  as well as  of milestones earned from our collaboration with takeda pharmaceutical company  ltd 
fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue for fiscal grew from with improvements in both collaboration revenue  which increased million  and license and milestone revenue  which increased million 
the improvement in collaboration revenue was the result of increased revenue  totaling million  from new or expanded collaborations with genentech  astrazeneca  intermune  takeda  elan pharmaceuticals  inc  and roche palo alto llc 
this increase was partially offset by expired research programs with icos corporation  japan tobacco inc  and genpath pharmaceuticals  which had resulted in a total of million in revenue during fiscal further offsetting the increase in collaboration revenue were the declines in revenue from custom libraries of million and lead generation libraries of million  each declining primarily due to continued increasing competition from foreign chemistry service providers 
the up front license fee and phase milestone payment for arry that was received from astrazeneca in the latter half of fiscal  together with the up front license fee that was received from genentech in the same half of fiscal  aggregating million  caused the majority of the increase to license and milestone revenue 
revenues associated with these arrangements were recognized over the full year of fiscal  compared to recognition during only part of the year in fiscal a million milestone payment received from amgen in fiscal also contributed to the increased license and milestone revenue 
share based compensation effective july   we adopted the fair value method of accounting for share based compensation arrangements in accordance with fasb statement no 
r  share based payment an amendment of fasb statement no 
and sfas r  using the modified prospective method of transition 
share based compensation arrangements covered by sfas r currently include stock options granted under our amended and restated stock option and incentive plan the option plan and purchases of common stock by our employees at a discount to the market price during offering periods under our employee stock purchase plan the espp 
prior to july   we accounted for share based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method of accounting in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under the provisions of apb  no compensation expense was recognized when stock options were granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than market value on the date of grant and no compensation expense was recognized for purchases of shares of our common stock by employees under our espp 
under the modified prospective method of transition  we are not required to restate our prior period financial statements to reflect expensing of share based compensation under sfas r 
therefore  the results for fiscal are not comparable to prior fiscal years 
as required by the provisions of sfas r  we recorded million  or per share  of share based compensation expense during fiscal this amount is allocated among cost of revenue  research and development expenses for proprietary drug discovery and selling  general and administrative expenses based on the function of the respective employee 
this charge had no impact on our reported cash flows 
we used the black scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of our share based compensation arrangements 
as of june   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share based compensation arrangements granted under the option plan
