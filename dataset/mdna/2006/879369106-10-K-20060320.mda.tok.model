item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are focused on achieving consistent and sustainable growth through the continued development of our core businesses and carefully selected acquisitions 
our internal growth initiatives include the development of new products  moving existing products into market adjacencies in which we already participate with other products and the expansion of market share 
our core revenue growth in as compared to  excluding the impacts of currency  acquisitions and divestitures  was 
during the first six months of  our results were benefited by the contribution from the third quarter acquisition of hudson respiratory care inc  or hudsonrci  a leading provider of disposable medical products for respiratory care and anesthesia 
further in  we acquired a small repair products and services business in the aerospace segment for million 
during  we commenced a portfolio review program that resulted in the sale of a number of non core businesses and product lines in pre tax gross gain loss date business or product line sold segment proceeds on sale dollars in millions october medical product line medical august european medical product sterilization business medical august automotive pedal systems business commercial february sermatech international a surface engineering specialty coatings business aerospace 
table of contents in january and february  we also completed the sale of two small product lines in our medical segment and an industrial cables business in our commercial segment 
during the second quarter of  we adopted a plan to sell a small medical business 
we are actively marketing this business and recognized a loss of million in based upon the excess of the carrying value of the business as compared to the estimated fair value of the business less costs to sell 
additionally  we recognized a million reduction in the carrying value of the automotive pedal systems business during for and comparable periods  the automotive pedal systems business  the european medical product sterilization business  the small medical business and sermatech business have been presented in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced and commenced implementation of our restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve future operating performance and position us for future earnings growth 
the planned restructuring actions have included exiting or divesting of non core or low performing businesses  consolidating manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to share services 
the charges associated with the restructuring program for continuing operations that are included in restructuring costs during totaled million  of which  and were attributable to our commercial  medical and aerospace segments  respectively 
on july   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of outstanding teleflex common stock over twelve months ending july under the approved plan  we repurchased million shares on the open market during for an aggregate purchase price of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we eliminated the one month lag for certain of our foreign operations to coincide with the timing of reporting for all of our other operations 
as a result  our consolidated results for include the results of those operations for the month of december and the entire twelve months of  whereas our consolidated results for include the results of those operations for the month of december and the first eleven months of and our consolidated results for include the results of those operations for the entire twelve months of this change increased our consolidated revenues for by million and reduced our consolidated income from continuing operations before taxes and minority interest for by million 
on october  the american jobs creation act  or ajca  was signed into law 
the ajca includes a deduction of of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated  as defined in the ajca 
the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and complexities  and during the past nine months  we have been analyzing the previous guidance provided by the treasury department and the potential impact of applying the repatriation provision to unremitted foreign earnings held by our various controlled foreign corporations 
during the fourth quarter  management completed its analysis of the impact of the ajca and finalized and executed a repatriation plan 
under this plan  we repatriated million of dividends during november and december accordingly  we recorded a tax expense of approximately million during the fourth quarter of as a result of this repatriation 
this tax expense was offset by a tax benefit of approximately million related to excess foreign tax credits generated in connection with this repatriation 
management obtained the requisite corporate officer and board of directors approvals of the domestic reinvestment plan within the timeframe specified 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting estimates  which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  are the most pervasive and important to the presenta 
table of contents tion of our financial condition and results of operations and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
inventory utilization inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market 
inherent in this valuation are significant management judgments and estimates concerning excess inventory and obsolescence rates 
based upon these judgments and estimates  we record a reserve to adjust the carrying amount of our inventories 
we regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
in assessing historical usage  we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage 
our inventory reserve was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
dispositions and currency fluctuations accounted for the majority of this decline 
accounting for long lived assets the ability to realize long lived assets is evaluated periodically as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including undiscounted cash flow and profitability projections that incorporate  as applicable  the impact on the existing business 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
any impairment loss  if indicated  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of our recorded goodwill 
in addition  we test our other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
these impairment tests can be significantly altered by estimates of future performance  long term discount rates and market price valuation multiples 
these estimates will likely change over time 
many of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality 
goodwill and other intangible assets totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits we provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retired employees  including pensions and postretirement healthcare 
several statistical and other factors which attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans 
these factors include actuarial assumptions about discount rates  expected rates of return on plan assets  compensation increases  turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates 
we review the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
a basis point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease the total net periodic pension and postretirement healthcare expense for by approximately million and would decrease the projected benefit obligation at december  by approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase these amounts by approximately million and million  respectively 
a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would impact annual pension expense by approximately million 
a increase in the assumed healthcare trend rate would increase the benefit expense by approximately million and would increase the projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
a decrease in the assumed healthcare trend rate would decrease the benefit expense 
table of contents by approximately million and would decrease the projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
accounting for restructuring costs restructuring costs  which include termination benefits  contract termination costs  asset impairments and other restructuring costs are recorded at estimated fair value 
key assumptions in calculating the restructuring costs include the terms that may be negotiated to exit certain contractual obligations  the realizable value of certain assets associated with discontinued product lines and the timing of employees leaving the company 
the estimated total cost of the restructuring and divestiture actions which commenced in november is anticipated to be between million and million 
accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for which the collection of the full amount of accounts receivable is doubtful 
the allowance is based on our historical experience  the period an account is outstanding  the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services 
we review the allowance periodically and adjust it as necessary 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the decline is primarily attributable to currency fluctuations 
product warranty liability most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of the sales 
we estimate our warranty costs and liability based on a number of factors including historical trends of units sold  the status of existing claims  recall programs and communication with customers 
our estimated product warranty liability was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
accounting for income taxes our annual provision for income taxes and determination of the deferred tax assets and liabilities require management to assess uncertainties  make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates 
we conduct a broad range of operations around the world  subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions  resulting at times in tax audits  disputes and potentially litigation  the outcome of which is uncertain 
management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities 
to the extent the final outcome differs  future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities will be necessary 
our income taxes payable was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
we are also required to assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets  taking into consideration our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
based on this assessment  management must evaluate the need for  and amount of  valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
to the extent facts and circumstances change in the future  adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required

results of operations discussion of growth from acquisitions reflects the impact of a purchased company up to twelve months beyond the date of acquisition 
activity beyond the initial twelve months is considered core growth 
core growth excludes the impact of translating the results of international subsidiaries at different currency exchange rates from year to year  the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations and the comparable activity of divested companies within the most recent twelve month period 
the following comparisons exclude the impact of certain businesses sold or discontinued  which have been presented in our consolidated financial results as discontinued operations as outlined above 
comparison of and revenues increased in to billion from billion in this increase was due to increases of from core growth and from acquisitions  offset  in part  by decreases of from dispositions and from the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag in for certain of our foreign operations 
the commercial  medical and aerospace segments comprised  and of our revenues  respectively 
materials  labor and other product costs as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared with in due primarily to the impact of duplicate costs and inefficiencies related to the transfer of products between facilities in the commercial segment associated with the restructuring program 
selling  engineering and administrative expenses operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to in compared with in due primarily to the continuing reduction of facilities and supporting infrastructure costs and decreased unallocated corporate expenses relative to higher revenues 
interest expense increased in principally from higher acquisition related debt balances in the first half of interest income increased in primarily due to higher average cash balances  related to increased proceeds received from sales of businesses and assets in the effective income tax rate was in compared with in the higher rate in was primarily the result of the increase in foreign earnings for businesses located in higher taxed jurisdictions 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries increased million in due to increased profits from our entities that are not wholly owned

diluted earnings per share increased to  and includes the net gain on sales of businesses and assets and the cost of restructuring and discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced and commenced implementation of our restructuring and divestiture program designed to improve future operating performance and position us for future earnings growth 
the actions have included exiting or divesting of non core or low performing businesses  consolidating manufacturing operations and reorganizing administrative functions to enable businesses to share services 
certain costs associated with our restructuring and divestiture program are not included in restructuring costs 
all inventory adjustments that resulted from the restructuring and divestiture program and certain other costs associated with closing out businesses during and are included in materials  labor and other product costs and totaled million and million  respectively 
the million in costs for related to our aerospace segment 
of the million in costs for  million and million were attributed to our commercial and aerospace segments  respectively 

table of contents for and  the charges  including changes in estimates  associated with the restructuring and divestiture program by segment that are included in restructuring costs were as follows commercial medical aerospace total dollars in thousands termination benefits contract termination costs asset impairments other restructuring costs commercial medical aerospace total dollars in thousands termination benefits contract termination costs asset impairments other restructuring costs termination benefits are comprised of severance related payments for all employees terminated in connection with the restructuring and divestiture program 
contract termination costs relate primarily to the termination of leases in conjunction with the consolidation of facilities and in also include a million reduction in the estimated cost associated with a lease termination in conjunction with a consolidation of manufacturing facilities in our commercial segment 
asset impairments relate primarily to machinery and equipment associated with the consolidation of manufacturing facilities and in also relate to goodwill associated with our industrial gas turbine aftermarket services business 
other restructuring costs include expenses primarily related to the consolidation of manufacturing operations and the reorganization of administrative functions 
as of december   we expect to incur the following future restructuring costs in our medical segment over the next quarters dollars in thousands termination benefits contract termination costs other restructuring costs cost savings from our restructuring and divestiture program were approximately million in and we expect cost savings for to be between million and million 
comparison of and revenues increased in to billion from billion in this increase was due to increases of from acquisitions  from core growth  from currency  from the consolidation of variable interest entities and from the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations  offset  in part  by a decrease of from dispositions

segment reviews the following is a discussion of our segment operating results 
additional information regarding our segments is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
commercial products in the commercial segment are manufactured for broad distribution as well as custom fabricated to meet individual customer needs 
consumer spending patterns influence the market trends for products sold to the automotive and marine markets 
automotive cable and shifter products are manufactured primarily for automotive oems 
discussion of marine and industrial product lines below includes the manufacturing and distribution of driver controls  motion controls  power and vehicle management systems and fuel management systems to the automotive supply  marine and industrial markets 
comparison of and commercial segment revenues declined in to billion from billion in the segment generated an increase of from core growth that was more than offset by a decrease from dispositions 
the segment benefited from strength in its industrial oem markets  the contribution of new driver controls and power and vehicle management system products and increased sales of driver and motion controls to automotive oem markets 
these benefits were more than offset by slower sales of products into marine and recreational markets 
commercial segment operating profit declined in to million from million in this decline primarily reflects lower volume related contributions from higher margin marine and recreational products  the impact of duplicate costs and inefficiencies related to the transfer of products between two tier automotive supply facilities  the bankruptcy of an automotive supply customer and the impact of divestitures made in operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to in from in assets in the commercial segment declined million or  primarily due to the impact of currency and business dispositions 

table of contents comparison of and commercial segment revenues increased in to billion from billion in the improvement was due to increases of from core growth  from currency and from acquisitions  offset  in part  by a decrease from dispositions 
revenue from driver control products sold to oem s increased slightly in compared to  with increases from currency and core growth mostly offset by a decrease from a disposition 
for the remainder of the segment  three fourths of the revenue improvements were the result of core gains 
favorable currency translation provided a majority of the remaining increase  revenues from acquired entities were equivalent to the impact of dispositions 
commercial segment operating profit declined in to million from million in marine and industrial operating profit improved on volume gains which were partially offset by a cancellation of automotive alternative fuel programs in north america  pricing pressure in the automotive supplier market and costs related to a new product launch 
operating profit in the automotive cables and shifters product line declined as a result of pricing pressure and increased raw material costs 
operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to in from in assets in the commercial segment increased million  as currency and receivable increases in european automotive cable and shifter and united states light duty cables were tempered by the impact of business dispositions 
medical products in the medical segment generally are required to meet exacting standards of performance and have long product life cycles 
economic influences on revenues relate primarily to spending patterns in the worldwide medical devices and hospital supply market 
comparison of and medical segment revenues increased in to million from million in this increase was due to increases of from acquisitions and from core growth  offset  in part  by decreases of from the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag in for certain of our foreign operations and from dispositions 
medical segment revenues increased primarily as a result of the increased sale of disposable medical products  particularly related to the third quarter acquisition of hudsonrci  a provider of respiratory care products 
sales of surgical instruments and medical devices increased primarily as a result of new product sales and volume increases for specialty devices sold to medical device manufacturers 
medical segment operating profit increased in to million from million in driven primarily by the hudsonrci acquisition and significant improvements in the core business as benefits of the restructuring program began to be recognized 
operating profit as a percent of revenues increased to in from in assets in the medical segment declined million or  primarily due to the impact of currency 
comparison of and medical segment revenues increased in to million from million in this increase was due to increases of from acquisitions  from core growth  from currency  from the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations and from the consolidation of variable interest entities 
in disposable medical products  of the growth came from the hudsonrci acquisition with currency and core improvement providing a majority of the remaining increase 
in surgical instruments and medical devices  the cardiothoracic acquisition in the third quarter of accounted for over two thirds of the year over year revenue improvement 

table of contents medical segment operating profit increased in to million from million in this increase was driven largely by acquisitions and core volume gains in both the disposable medical products and surgical instruments and medical devices product lines 
operating profit as a percent of revenues declined to in from in assets in the medical segment increased million or primarily due to the hudsonrci acquisition 
aerospace products and services in the aerospace segment  many of which are proprietary  require a high degree of engineering sophistication and are often custom designed 
economic influences on these products and services relate primarily to spending patterns in the worldwide aerospace industry and to demand for power generation 
comparison of and aerospace segment revenues increased in to million from million in strong core growth in repair products and services and in sales of both narrow body cargo loading systems and wide body cargo system conversions  along with an increase due to a small acquisition in  was partially offset by the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag in for certain of our foreign operations and by the phase out of industrial gas turbine aftermarket services 
aerospace segment operating profit increased to a profit of million in from a loss of million in  an improvement of million 
higher volume and improvements in precision machined components and the cargo systems businesses contributed to the increase as did a reduction in losses resulting from the exit of the industrial gas turbine aftermarket services 
operating profit loss as a percent of revenues was in versus in assets in the aerospace segment declined million or  due primarily to the impact of the sale of the sermatech international business 
comparison of and aerospace segment revenues increased in to million from million in this increase was due to increases of from core growth  from currency and from the impact of eliminating the one month reporting lag for certain of our foreign operations  offset  in part  by a decrease from dispositions 
core growth was the result of double digit growth in repair products and services and precision machined components  which more than compensated for declines in industrial gas turbine  or igt and cargo handling systems 
core revenue growth was in part due to increased sales of lower margin offerings 
aerospace segment operating profit declined in to a loss of million from a profit of million in operating profit declined due primarily to one time charges in igt related to our restructuring and divestiture program  pricing pressures from the aerospace oems and aftermarket and higher costs in manufactured components 
operating profit loss as a percent of revenues was in versus in assets in the aerospace segment declined million or due substantially to the phase out of the igt business 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided net cash of approximately million during changes in our operating assets and liabilities during resulted in a net cash inflow of million 
the most significant change was a decrease in accounts receivable  which was primarily due to improved cash collection practices including the sale of certain receivables under a non recourse securitization program 
our financing activities during consisted primarily of a reduction in long term borrowings of million and proceeds from long term borrowings of million  as a result of improved operating cash flow  the repatriation of foreign earnings  proceeds from the disposition of businesses and lower capital spending 
during  we also made payments to minority interest shareholders of million and purchases of treasury stock of million

the most significant changes were an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in inventories  offset  in part  by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in income taxes payable 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses was due primarily to increased accruals associated with the restructuring and divestiture program 
the decrease in inventories was the result of our focus on improved working capital management 
the increase in accounts receivable was largely a result of increased business levels and the hudsonrci acquisition 
the decrease in income taxes payable was a result of tax deductions associated with the restructuring and divestiture program  for which the cash benefits were received in our financing activities during consisted primarily of the receipt of million in gross proceeds from long term borrowings  primarily for the acquisition of hudsonrci 
this amount is offset by a decrease in notes payable and current borrowings of million and a reduction in long term borrowings of million  driven by improved operating cash flow  proceeds from the disposition of businesses and lower year over year capital spending 
our investing activities during consisted primarily of payments for businesses acquired of million 
we had net cash provided by discontinued operations of million in operating activities provided net cash of approximately million during changes in our operating assets and liabilities during resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
the most significant change was an increase in accounts receivable  offset  in part  by an increase in income taxes payable 
accounts receivable growth was in line with volume improvement as accounts receivable as a percentage of fourth quarter revenues remained flat

the assets of the special purpose entity are not available to satisfy our obligations 
during the first quarter of  we amended the securitization program agreement 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  transfers of assets under the program now qualify as sales of receivables and accordingly  million and of accounts receivable and the related amounts previously recorded in notes payable were removed from the consolidated balance sheet as of december  and december   respectively 

table of contents on july   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of outstanding teleflex common stock over twelve months ending july under the approved plan  we repurchased million shares on the open market for an aggregate purchase price of million during during the fourth quarter of  management completed its analysis of the impact of the ajca and finalized and executed a foreign earnings repatriation plan 
under this plan  we repatriated million of dividends during november and december the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and december   respectively  relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets  primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that a valuation allowance be established and maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in addition to the cash generated from operations  we have approximately million in committed and million in uncommitted unused lines of credit available 
the availability of the lines of credit is dependent upon us maintaining our financial condition including our continued compliance with bank covenants 
various senior and term note agreements provide for the maintenance of certain financial ratios and limit the repurchase of our stock and payment of cash dividends 
under the most restrictive of these provisions  million of retained earnings was available for dividends and stock repurchases at december  on february   the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share on our common stock  which was paid on march  to holders of record on march  as of march   we had approximately  holders of record of our common stock 
fixed rate borrowings comprised of total borrowings at december  approximately of our total borrowings of million are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro  which we believe provides a natural hedge against fluctuations in the value of assets outside the united states 
the following table provides our net debt to total capital ratio dollars in thousands net debt includes current borrowings long term borrowings total debt less cash and cash equivalents net debt total capital includes net debt shareholders equity total capital percent of net debt to total capital the decline in our percent of net debt to total capital for as compared to is primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from the sale of businesses and assets and improved management of working capital 

table of contents we believe that our cash flow from operations and our ability to access additional funds through credit facilities will enable us to fund our operating requirements  capital expenditures and additional acquisition opportunities 
contractual obligations at december  are as follows payments due by period less more than than total year years years years dollars in millions long term borrowings interest obligations operating lease obligations minimum purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions 
these obligations relate primarily to material purchase requirements 
we also have obligations with respect to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
off balance sheet arrangements we have residual value guarantees under operating leases for plant and equipment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these guarantees is approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain financial risks  specifically fluctuations in market interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of these risks 
all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
we are also exposed to changes in the market traded price of our common stock as it influences the valuation of stock options and their effect on pro forma earnings as disclosed 

table of contents interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our borrowing activities and our cash balances 
interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk 
the table below is an analysis of the amortization and related interest rates by year of maturity for our fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
variable interest rates shown below are weighted average rates of the debt portfolio 
for the swaps  notional amounts and related interest rates are shown by year of maturity 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps as of december  was million 
year of maturity thereafter total dollars in thousands fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate debt average interest rate amount subject to swaps variable to fixed average rate to be received average rate to be paid a increase or decrease in variable interest rates would adversely or positively impact our expected net earnings by approximately million or million  respectively 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to fluctuations in market values of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of certain subsidiaries 
we have entered into forward contracts with several major financial institutions to hedge a portion of projected cash flows from these exposures 
the following table presents our open forward currency contracts as of december   which all mature in forward contract notional amounts presented below are expressed in the stated currencies in thousands 
the fair value of the open forward contracts as of december  was million 
forward currency contracts pay us dollars receive euros receive singapore dollars receive canadian dollars receive swedish krona receive british pounds receive malaysian ringgits a movement of in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies would impact our expected net earnings by approximately million
