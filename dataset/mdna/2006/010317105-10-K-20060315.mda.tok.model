executive summary the purpose of this section is to provide a brief summary overview of additional detail about the income statement and balance sheet is provided in the pages following this summary 
income statement alabama national reported million in net income  a increase from  with diluted earnings per share growing from in to in alabama national has two components of revenue net interest income and noninterest income 
the primary reasons for increased net income in are the increase in net interest income and the impact of having a full twelve months performance for banks that were acquired during strong loan growth during and an increase in the net interest margin generated much of the increased net interest income 
net interest income grew to million in the company experienced growth in its net interest spread and in its net interest margin of and  respectively 
alabama national experienced some margin improvement beginning in the second half of  when the federal reserve began taking actions to increase short term interest rates 
as short term rates rose  the spread between the rate earned on loans  investments  and other earning assets and the rate paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities expanded 
alabama national s loan portfolio excluding loans held for sale grew by million  or  during because loans are typically the company s highest yielding asset  this loan growth aided net interest income growth 
noninterest income in decreased by million  or  from levels 
this category of income includes mortgage banking  securities brokerage and trust services  investment services  insurance services  and service charges and other fees associated with traditional retail and commercial banking 
the decline was centered in the investment services area down million  or and in service charges down million  or 
the decline in the investment services area is attributed to two factors a more difficult interest rate environment in  with the flattening of the yield curve due to rising short term rates and declining long term rates  and the november departure of several fixed income salespeople from the company 
securities brokerage and trust services income offset some of this decline  with million in increased revenue 
this division continues to experience growth in numbers of customers and client assets 
the residential mortgage banking area showed revenue growth of million  or  in other noninterest income  which includes debit and credit card income  the commercial mortgage banking area which was acquired in september  letter of credit fees  and other items  grew million over other areas of noninterest income that experienced increases in include gains on disposal of assets million and bank owned life insurance income million 
insurance commissions were down slightly million from on the expense side  alabama national s noninterest expenses grew million  or  during as compared with the largest increase in noninterest expense was in salaries and employee benefits  which grew million  or 
occupancy and equipment expense grew by million  or 
increases in both of these areas are partially attributable to the company s growth  as new locations lead to increased staffing and occupancy expenses 
in addition  the company s performance based incentive compensation expense also grew in  contributing to the increase in salary and employee benefits 
another factor affecting the increase in noninterest expenses is that the three bank acquisitions completed in were part of alabama national s operating expense base for a full year in and only part of the year in other operating expenses  which category includes such expenses as advertising  supplies and printing  and communication expenses  increased million  or  during as compared with as a partial offset to these increases  commission based compensation expenses declined for a second straight year with the decline in commission based revenue 
balance sheet alabama national s total assets grew million  or  during while the company acquired three banks in  accounting for much of that year s growth  no bank acquisitions were completed in the asset growth was largely attributable to the million growth in loans and leases up 
this loan growth was somewhat offset by a million  or  reduction in securities balances 
deposits grew million during asset quality alabama national reported net charge offs of million  or of average loans and leases  down from s million  or of average loans and leases 
nonperforming assets at december  were million of period end loans and leases and foreclosed property  down from year end s million of period end loans and leases and foreclosed property 
potential problem loans fell to million at december  from year end s million 
alabama national s provision for loan and lease losses rose from million in to million in this increase was due largely to the growth in loans and leases during the year 
as a result of loan growth  net chargeoffs and the provision for loan and lease losses  alabama national s allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of period end loans and leases declined to at december  from at december  selected bank financial data alabama national s success is dependent upon the financial performance of its subsidiary banks the banks

significant accounting policies utilized by alabama national are discussed in more detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth beginning on page f herein 
some of the more complex technical accounting policies require management to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the valuation of reported assets and liabilities  including associated revenues  expenses  and disclosure 
the following briefly describes the more complex policies involving a significant amount of judgments about valuation and the application of complex accounting standards and interpretations 
allowance for loan and lease losses alabama national records estimated probable inherent credit losses in the loan and lease portfolios as an allowance for loan and lease losses 
the methodologies and assumptions for determining the adequacy of the overall allowance for loan and lease losses involve significant judgments to be made by management 
some of the more critical judgments supporting the amount of alabama national s allowance for loan and lease losses include judgments about credit worthiness of borrowers  estimated value of underlying collateral  assumptions about cash flow  determination of loss factors for estimating credit losses  and the impact of current events  conditions  and other factors impacting the level of probable inherent losses 
under different conditions or using different assumptions  the actual amount of credit losses ultimately realized by alabama national may be different than management s estimates provided in the consolidated financial statements 
for a more complete discussion of the methodology employed to calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses  see note to alabama national s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report and provision and allowance for loan and lease losses below 
mergers and acquisitions alabama national s growth in business and profitability over the past several years has been enhanced significantly by mergers and acquisitions 
effective july   alabama national adopted sfas no 
 business combinations  which allows only the use of the purchase method of accounting 
for purchase acquisitions  alabama national is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their fair value  which in many instances involves estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
the determination of the useful lives of intangible assets is subjective as is the appropriate amortization period for such intangible assets 
these estimates also include the establishment of various accruals and allowances based on planned facilities dispositions and employee severance considerations  among other acquisition related items 
in addition  purchase acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill  which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair value of net assets acquired compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
income taxes the calculation of alabama national s income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination 
as part of alabama national s overall business strategy  management must consider tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances under consideration 
this analysis includes evaluating the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits 
management closely monitors tax developments in order to evaluate the effect they may have on alabama national s overall tax position 
pension and other postretirement benefits alabama national offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to employees 
the calculation of obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions 
actuarial valuations and the determination of future market values of plan assets are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used 
please refer to note to alabama national s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for disclosures related to alabama national s benefit plans 
stock based compensation alabama national uses a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation costs 
compensation costs for stock based compensation arrangements are measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and are recognized over the related service period 
accounting for stock based compensation requires the use of an option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the grant date  the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the volatility of the underlying stock and the expected dividends on it  and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
please refer to note to alabama national s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for disclosures related to alabama national s stock based compensation awards 
results of operations year ended december   compared with year ended december  alabama national s net income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  net income per diluted share increased to for the year ended december   as compared to recorded for the year ended december  return on average assets during was  compared with during  and return on average equity was during  compared with during net interest income increased million  or  to million in  from million in  as interest income increased million and interest expense increased million 
contributing to this increase is strong growth in alabama national s earnings assets  particularly loans 
during  average earning assets grew million  or  to billion for the year ended december  average loans and leases experienced the most significant growth during  increasing million 
alabama national continues to have strong organic growth in loans due to continued strength in many of the economies in the markets served by alabama national 
in general  loans are alabama national s highest yielding earning asset  and management continues to emphasize steady loan growth 
to support the asset growth  average interest bearing liabilities increased million  to billion in all categories of average interest bearing liabilities increased during  except for long term debt 
alabama national s net interest spread and net interest margin were and  respectively  in  compared to and  respectively  in the net interest margin for was higher due to the impact of the recent interest rate increases by the federal reserve 
these increases have increased the yield substantially on alabama national s loans and leases 
the yield earned on loans and leases increased basis points in to 
the federal reserve rate increases have also increased the rate paid on deposits 
overall interest cost on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to in from during generally deposits  and specifically time deposits  did not reprice as quickly as variable rate loans and led to an increase in alabama national s net interest margin during see net interest income 
alabama national recorded a provision for loan and lease losses of million during  compared to million in management believes that both loan loss experience and asset quality indicate that the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an adequate level  although there can be no assurance that economic factors will not require future adjustments to the allowance 
alabama national s allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of period end loans and leases excluding loans held for sale was at december   compared with at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of period end nonperforming assets was at december   compared with at december  alabama national experienced net charge offs of million in  equating to a ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases of  compared with net charge offs of million in  equating to a ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases of

because of an increase in pre tax income  income tax expense was million for  compared to million for the effective tax rate for was  compared to for these effective tax rates are affected by items of income and expense that are not subject to federal or state taxation 
the effective rate in is higher than due to higher pre tax income without a corresponding increase in income items not subject to federal or state taxation 
year ended december   compared with year ended december  alabama national s net income increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  net income per diluted share increased to for the year ended december   as compared to recorded for the year ended december  return on average assets during was  compared with during  and return on average equity was during  compared with during net interest income increased million  or  to million in  from million in  as interest income increased million and interest expense increased million 
acquisitions during accounted for million of the increase in net interest income 
also contributing to the increase in net interest income was a decrease in the interest rate paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
during  alabama national was able to continue to decrease the rates paid on deposits as time deposits that were originated in higher interest rate environments matured and repriced at the current lower rates 
as the federal reserve bank started increasing rates during the later half of  alabama national was able to control the increase on rates paid on interest bearing transaction accounts and money market accounts  thereby controlling deposit costs and increasing net interest income during alabama national continued to experience strong growth in its earning assets in during  average earning assets grew billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  average loans and leases and average securities each had significant growth during average loans and leases increased million and average securities increased million 
the acquisitions contributed million and million of the increase in average loans and leases and average securities for  respectively 
in alabama national continued to have strong organic growth in loans due to continued strength in many of the economies in the markets served by alabama national 
in general  loans are alabama national s highest yielding earning asset as management emphasized steady loan growth 
average interest bearing liabilities increased million  to billion in over acquisitions during accounted for million of this increase 
despite the increase in average interest bearing liabilities  interest expense increased only million  or 
all categories of average interest bearing liabilities increased during  except for other short term borrowings 
alabama national s net interest spread and net interest margin were and  respectively  in  compared to and  respectively  in the net interest margin for was slightly higher than due in part to lower rates paid on time deposits 
many of the time deposits in alabama national s portfolio originated in lower interest rate environments and these deposits can only reprice at maturity 
the average yield on loans and leases during was basis points lower than the impact of the federal reserve rate increases in the latter half of was not able to entirely offset the lower rates in the first half of see net interest income

the effective rate in is higher than due to higher pre tax income without a corresponding increase in income items not subject to federal or state taxation 
net interest income the largest component of alabama national s net income is its net interest income the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds used to support its assets 
net interest income is determined by the yield earned on alabama national s earning assets and rates paid on its interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income divided by average earning assets represents alabama national s net interest margin 
average balances  income  expenses and rates the following table depicts  on a taxable equivalent basis for the periods indicated  certain information related to alabama national s average balance sheet and its average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields or costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average daily balances of the associated assets or liabilities

fees in the amount of million  million and million are included in interest and fees on loans for   and  respectively 
during  alabama national experienced an increase in net interest income of million  or  to million  compared with million in net interest income increased primarily due to an increase in the volume of average earning assets outstanding coupled with an increased yield on earning assets 
the primary reason for the growth in earning assets is attributable to organic loan growth generated by alabama national 
in addition to strong loan growth alabama national benefited from the interest rate increases by the federal reserve during and deposits  specifically time deposits  did not reprice as quickly as many of alabama national s interest earning assets 
also contributing to the increased net interest margin was the mix of growth in alabama national s deposits 
a large portion of the growth in average liability balances occurred in demand deposits which have no interest cost and other transaction accounts that generally have lower interest rates such as interest bearing transaction accounts and savings and money markets 
during  the average balance in demand deposit accounts increased million and the average balance of interest bearing transaction accounts and savings and money market accounts increased a combined million 
during  average time deposits increased only million over levels 
the overall growth in earnings assets  primarily loans  and the mix of liability growth to support the asset growth created a higher net interest margin for alabama national during analysis of changes in net interest income the following table sets forth  on a taxable equivalent basis  the effect which varying levels of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the applicable rates had on changes in net interest income for versus and versus for purposes of this table  changes that are not solely attributable to volume or rate are allocated to volume and rate on a pro rata basis

the principal monitoring technique employed by alabama national is simulation analysis  which technique is augmented by gap analysis 
in simulation analysis  alabama national reviews each individual asset and liability category and their projected behavior in various different interest rate environments 
these projected behaviors are based upon management s past experiences and upon current competitive environments  including the various environments in the different markets in which alabama national competes 
using this projected behavior and differing rate scenarios as inputs  the simulation analysis generates as output projections of net interest income 
alabama national also periodically verifies the validity of this approach by comparing actual results with those that were projected in previous models 
see market risk 
another technique used by alabama national in interest rate management is the measurement of the interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets and liabilities  selling securities available for sale or trading securities  replacing an asset or liability at maturity or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
alabama national evaluates interest rate sensitivity risk and then formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing  and sources and prices of off balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest sensitivity risk 
alabama national uses computer simulations to measure the net income effect of various interest rate scenarios 
the modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net income over specified periods of time 
the following table illustrates alabama national s interest rate sensitivity at december   assuming the relevant assets and liabilities are collected and paid  respectively  based upon historical experience rather than their stated maturities 
interest sensitivity analysis amounts in thousands  except ratios december  within one month after one through three months after three through twelve months within one year one through three years greater than three years total a s s e t s earning assets loans and leases securities trading securities interest bearing deposits in other banks funds sold total interest earning assets l i a b i l i t i e s interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits demand deposits savings and money market deposits time deposits funds purchased short term borrowings long term debt total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap ratio of cumulative gap to total interest earning assets excludes nonaccrual loans of million 
excludes investment in equity securities with a fair market value of million 
excludes matured certificates which have not been redeemed by the customer and on which no interest is accruing 
alabama national generally benefits from increasing market rates of interest when it has an asset sensitive gap a positive number and generally benefits from decreasing market interest rates when it is liability sensitive a negative number 
as shown in the table above  alabama national is asset sensitive on a cumulative basis throughout the one year time frame  although it is liability sensitive during three through twelve month period 
alabama national is also asset sensitive during the one through three year time frame and liability sensitive in the greater than three years period  although it remains asset sensitive on a cumulative basis throughout all periods 
the current asset sensitive position is similar to the year end interest sensitivity analysis 
the interest sensitivity analysis presents only a static view of the timing and repricing opportunities  without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally 
for example  rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame  but those are viewed by management as significantly less interest sensitive than market based rates such as those paid on non core deposits 
for this and other reasons  management relies more upon the simulation analysis as noted above in managing interest rate risk 
net interest income may be impacted by other significant factors in a given interest rate environment  including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
market risk alabama national s earnings are dependent  to a large degree  on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on all earning assets  primarily loans and securities  and interest paid on all interest bearing liabilities  primarily deposits 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
alabama national s market risk arises primarily from inherent interest rate risk in its lending  investing and deposit gathering activities 
alabama national seeks to reduce its exposure to market risk through actively monitoring and managing its interest rate risk 
management relies upon static gap analysis to determine the degree of mismatch in the maturity and repricing distribution of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which quantifies  to a large extent  the degree of market risk inherent in alabama national s balance sheet 
gap analysis is further augmented by simulation analysis to evaluate the impact of varying levels of prevailing interest rates and the sensitivity of specific earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in those prevailing rates 
simulation analysis consists of evaluating the impact on net interest income given changes from basis points below the current prevailing rates adjusted in the period ended december  due to historically low interest rates to basis points above the current prevailing rates 
management makes certain assumptions as to the effect varying levels of interest rates have on certain earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which assumptions consider both historical experience and consensus estimates of outside sources 
with respect to the primary earning assets  loans and securities  certain features of individual types of loans and specific securities introduce uncertainty as to their expected performance at varying levels of interest rates 
in some cases  prepayment options exist whereby the borrower may elect to repay the obligation at any time prior to maturity 
these prepayment options make anticipating the performance of those instruments difficult given changes in prevailing interest rates 
at december   mortgage backed securities with a carrying value of million  or of total assets  and essentially every loan and lease  net of unearned income  totaling billion  or of total assets  carried such prepayment options 
management believes that assumptions used in its simulation analysis about the performance of financial instruments with such prepayment options are appropriate 
however  the actual performance of these financial instruments may differ from management s estimates due to several factors  including the diversity and financial sophistication of the customer base  the general level of prevailing interest rates and the relationship to their historical levels  and general economic conditions 
the difference between those assumptions and actual results  if significant  could cause the actual results to differ from those indicated by the simulation analysis 
deposits totaled billion  or of total assets at december  since deposits are the primary funding source for earning assets  the associated market risk is considered by management in its simulation analysis 
generally  it is anticipated that deposits will be sufficient to support funding requirements 
however  the rates paid for deposits at varying levels of prevailing interest rates have a significant impact on net interest income and therefore  must be quantified by alabama national in its simulation analysis 
specifically  alabama national s spread  the difference between the rates earned on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  is generally higher when prevailing rates are higher 
as prevailing rates decline  the spread tends to compress  with severe compression at very low prevailing interest rates 
this characteristic is called spread compression and adversely affects net interest income in the simulation analysis when anticipated prevailing rates are reduced from current rates 
management relies upon historical experience to estimate the degree of spread compression in its simulation analysis 
management believes that such estimates of possible spread compression are reasonable 
however  if the degree of spread compression varies from that expected  the actual results could differ from those indicated by the simulation analysis 
the following tables illustrate the results of simulation analysis used by alabama national to determine the extent to which market risk would affect net interest margin for the next twelve months if prevailing interest rates increased or decreased the specified amounts from current rates 
for the year ended december   since interest rates were relatively low  alabama national elected to model interest rate decreases of and basis points 
management did not prepare a scenario that decreased current rates by basis points so the comparable scenario is not available for as noted above  this model uses estimates and assumptions in both balance sheet growth and asset and liability account rate reactions to changes in prevailing interest rates 
because of the inherent use of these estimates and assumptions in the simulation model used to derive this market risk information  the actual results of the future impact of market risk on alabama national s net interest margin may differ from that found in the tables

provision and allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable inherent credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
management determines the allowance based on an ongoing evaluation of risk as it correlates to potential losses within the portfolio 
increases to the allowance are made by charges to the provision for loan and lease losses 
loans or leases deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
in the determination of the allowance  management utilizes the loan review department s quarterly independent analysis of the minimum required loan and lease loss reserve for each bank 
in these analyses  larger problem loans of a defined threshold are reviewed for impairment or for loss exposure based on their payment performance  probability of default  and value of the collateral 
these totals are then specifically allocated to the reserve 
loan and lease portfolios are then divided into various homogeneous risk pools utilizing call codes  loan products  and internal risk ratings 
historical losses are used to estimate the probable loss in the current portfolio using both an average loss methodology and a migration loss methodology 
the methodologies and the time periods considered are subjective and vary for each risk pool based on systematic risk relative to its ability to estimate losses 
as every loan has a risk of loss  the calculation begins with a minimum loss allocation for each loan pool 
the minimum loss is estimated based on long term trends for each bank  the banking industry  and the economy 
a minimum loss allocation is similarly applied to letters of credit and unused lines of credit 
loss allocations are adjusted for changes in the economy  problem loans  payment performance  loan policy  management  credit administration systems  credit concentrations  loan growth  and other elements over the time periods utilized in the methodology 
the adjusted loss allocations are then applied to the current balances in their respective loan pools 
loss allocations are totaled  yielding the required allowance for loan and lease losses for each bank 
each bank s required allowance for loan and lease losses is aggregated yielding the consolidated required allowance for alabama national 
management incorporates the data from the quarterly required allowance assessments with interim changes to that data in its ongoing determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
management then takes into consideration other factors that may support an allowance in excess of required minimums 
these factors include mergers and acquisitions  historically high loan growth  and rapid changes in the economy 
these factors increase uncertainty in the data used and assumptions made by management 
management believes that the data it uses in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses is sufficient to estimate the potential losses in the loan and lease portfolio  however  actual results could differ from management s estimates 
the following table presents the information associated with alabama national s allowance and provision for loan and lease losses for the dates indicated

allocation of allowance while no portion of the allowance is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of loans and the entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans  the following table represents management s allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses to specific loan categories 
amounts in thousands commercial and financial real estate construction real estate residential mortgage real estate commercial mortgage consumer lease financing receivables other unallocated total allowance for loan and lease losses allocation amounts within the allowance for loan and lease losses were affected by several factors identified throughout the calendar year 
total loan amounts specifically allocated to the allowance increased by thousand over december  non performing assets and potential problem loans decreased during by million and million  respectively  thus reducing the required allocations for these segments 
the most significant change occurred within the real estate construction and residential mortgage portfolio segments 
the allocation for real estate construction increased during by million  or 
the increase in allocation of the allowance for residential construction loans is primarily due to loan growth 
in addition  strong demand for housing stock and the effect of recent hurricanes have lead to increased material prices and labor shortages in certain alabama national markets 
losses directly attributable to these factors had not materialized by year end 
the allocation for real estate residential mortgage segment increased million  or  during contributing factors are loan growth and economic conditions 
elevated consumer debt and rising interest rates could have a negative impact on this portfolio with personal debt service requirements exceeding increases in personal income 
the real estate commercial mortgage allocation increased million  or  during due primarily to increased concentration levels within the loan segment 
the unallocated reserve decreased million  or 
this can be attributed  in part  to the stabilization of risk management systems as recent mergers and acquisitions mature 
there were no significant changes in the allowance methodology and assumptions year over year from to changes in allocation amounts for are most reflective of improved asset quality indicators  growth in various portfolio segments  changes in loan concentrations  and changes in local and national economic conditions 
nonperforming assets the following table presents alabama national s nonperforming assets for the dates indicated 
nonperforming assets amounts in thousands  except percentages at december  nonaccrual loans restructured loans loans past due days or more and still accruing total nonperforming loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets allowance for loan and lease losses to period end loans allowance for loan and lease losses to period end nonperforming loans allowance for loan and lease losses to period end nonperforming assets net charge offs to average loans and leases nonperforming assets to period end loans and leases and foreclosed property nonperforming loans and leases to period end loans does not include loans held for sale 
accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful 
in addition to consideration of these factors  alabama national has a consistent and continuing policy of placing all loans on nonaccrual status if they become days or more past due 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest which is accrued on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when a problem loan is finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual writedown or charge off of the principal balance of the loan which would necessitate additional charges to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
during the years ending december   and  approximately   and  respectively  in additional interest income would have been recognized in earnings if alabama national s nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms 
total nonperforming assets decreased million  to million at december l   from million at december  other real estate owned decreased million to million at december  included in the year end other real estate balance is a former bank branch with a carrying value of million 
this branch was sold during the allowance for loan and lease losses to period end nonperforming loans was at december   compared with at december  this ratio will generally fluctuate from period to period depending upon nonperforming loan levels at period end 
potential problem loans a potential problem loan is one that management has concerns as to the borrower s future performance under terms of the loan contract 
these loans are current as to principal and interest  and accordingly  they are not included in the nonperforming asset categories 
management monitors these loans closely in order to ensure that alabama national s interests are protected 
at december   alabama national had certain loans considered by management to be potential problem loans totaling million  as compared with million at december  alabama national believes early identification of potential problem loans is an important factor in its ability to successfully collect such loans 
as such  it encourages early identification of potential problem loans both with its loan officers and loan review staff 
the level of potential problem loans is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses

as interest rates rose in  the higher ecr resulted in lower service charges 
other noninterest income increased million to million during  a increase over s total of million

the results of the operating segments include certain income and expense items that are allocated by management to the operating segments 
further  the results of each operating segment are not necessarily the same as would be expected if these activities were conducted by a stand alone entity because certain corporate overhead expenses are not allocated directly to each operating segment 
investment services the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the summary of operations for the investment services division of alabama national investment services division amounts in thousands year ended december  investment services revenue expenses and allocated charges net investment services income first american bank operates an investment department devoted primarily to handling correspondent banks investment needs 
investment services revenue consists primarily of commission income from the sale of fixed income securities to correspondent banks 
a small portion of investment services revenue is generated from fee based services  including asset liability consulting  bond accounting and security safekeeping 
investment services revenue decreased substantially to million during  from million in the revenue recorded by the investment division during  million  represents the highest revenue ever recorded for this division 
the revenue generated by the investment services division is dependent upon the demand for fixed income securities by its customers  which are primarily correspondent community banks 
demand for these securities during was high due to increased liquidity of community banks resulting from decreased loan demand and increased cash flow from their existing securities portfolio 
during and  the cash flow from the securities portfolio of correspondent banks slowed and loan demand increased  which negatively impacted the revenue for the investment services division 
in addition to the market conditions  another significant reason for decreased revenue production during is due to the departure a group of salespeople and support staff from this division during the fourth quarter of alabama national has moved to add additional qualified sales people and remains committed to this business line

the trust department of first american bank and nbc securities manage the assets of both institutional and individual customers located primarily in the markets served by alabama national 
the revenue generated by the securities brokerage and trust division consists primarily of commission income generated from the sale of equity securities and other investment products to individual and corporate customers  from fees paid for assets under management or custody and from fees related to investment consulting work performed for clients 
the securities brokerage and trust division also recognizes interest income from margin loans 
revenue for this division increased million  or  to million in revenue for this division increased million  or  to million in the increase in revenue during both and is attributable to continued expansion in the number of customers and total customer assets under management by these departments  as well as an increase in the number of registered representatives 
asset management fees recorded by the trust department of first american bank and nbc securities also increased during as a result of an increase in the total assets managed by this division 
the interest income from margin loans increased slightly during versus the levels recorded during and the additional registered representatives and new offices opened and variable overhead  combined with higher commission expense on the higher revenue base  led to an increase in the expenses and allocated charges for this division in mortgage lending division the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the summary of operations for the mortgage lending division of alabama national mortgage lending division amounts in thousands year ended december  gain on sale of mortgage loans interest income total revenue interest expense expenses and allocated charges net mortgage lending division income includes intercompany income allocated to mortgage lending division totaling   and  at december   and  respectively

the revenue recorded during both and are lower than the revenue recorded by the mortgage division in the revenue was a record amount due to the historically low interest rate environment and its effect on mortgage origination and refinancing activity 
expenses and allocated charges totaled million  compared to million during this increase is due to a higher level of mortgage revenue and its impact on compensation and other expenses 
revenue from the mortgage lending division is subject to fluctuation caused by a number of factors  including perhaps most prominently the interest rate environment 
the environment for this division was extremely favorable during during and mortgage activity from refinancing slowed considerably  but alabama national continues to expand and grow mortgage origination activity in the markets served by the company

earning assets loans and leases loans and leases are the largest category of earning assets and typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets 
associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks which management attempts to control and counterbalance 
total loans and leases averaged billion in  compared to billion in  an increase of million  or 
at december   total loans and leases  net of unearned income  were billion  compared to billion at the end of  an increase of million  or 
the growth in alabama national s loan and lease portfolio is attributable to alabama national s ability to attract new customers while maintaining consistent underwriting standards

in the context of this discussion  a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan  other than loans for construction purposes  secured by real estate  regardless of the purpose of the loan 
it is common practice for financial institutions in alabama national s market areas  and for alabama national in particular  to obtain a security interest or lien in real estate whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component 
in general  alabama national prefers real estate collateral to many other potential collateral sources  such as accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
the principal component of alabama national s loan portfolio is real estate mortgage loans 
at year end  this category totaled billion and represented of the total loan portfolio  compared to billion  or of the total loan portfolio at year end residential mortgage loans increased million  or  to billion at december   compared with million at december  commercial mortgage loans increased million  or  to billion at december  real estate construction loans experienced the largest increase of any category of loan 
real estate construction loans increased million  or  to billion at december   compared with million at december  real estate construction is now the largest category of loans for alabama national 
alabama national s focus on the home construction market  as well as strong commercial construction activity in markets it serves  led to this increase during the repayment of loans is a source of additional liquidity for alabama national 
the following table sets forth alabama national s loans maturing within specific intervals at december  loan maturity and sensitivity to changes in interest rates amounts in thousands december  one year or less over one year through five years over five years total commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate residential real estate commercial consumer predetermined rates floating rates total maturing after one year but within five years maturing after five years the information presented in the above table is based upon the contractual maturities of the individual loans  including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity 
renewal of such loans is subject to review and credit approval  as well as modification of terms upon their maturity 
consequently  management believes this treatment presents fairly the maturity and repricing structure of the loan portfolio 
securities securities  including securities classified as held to maturity or investment securities and available for sale  represent a significant portion of alabama national s earning assets 
securities averaged billion during  compared with billion during  an increase of million  or 
growth in the securities portfolio is generally a function of growth in funding sources net of lending opportunities  and during most of the earning asset growth of alabama national was in loans and leases and the securities portfolio remained relatively flat 
management attempts to maintain earning asset growth commensurate with its funding growth and with its overall growth plans 
at december   the securities portfolio totaled billion  including securities held to maturity with an amortized cost of million and securities available for sale with a market value of million 
the following tables set forth the carrying value of securities held by alabama national at the dates indicated

comprised primarily of federal home loan bank and federal reserve bank stock 
at december   mortgage backed securities  consisting of collateralized mortgage obligations and pass through mortgage obligations  had a carrying value totaling million 
these mortgage backed securities include million classified as investment securities and million classified as securities available for sale 
management expects the annual repayment of the underlying mortgages to vary as a result of monthly repayment of principal and or interest required under terms of the underlying promissory notes 
further  the actual rate of repayment is subject to changes depending upon the terms of the underlying mortgages  the relative level of mortgage interest rates  and the structure of the securities 
when relative interest rates decline to levels below that of the underlying mortgages  acceleration of principal repayment is expected as some borrowers on the underlying mortgages refinance to lower rates 
when the underlying rates on mortgage loans are comparable to  or in excess of  market rates  repayment more closely conforms to scheduled amortization in accordance with terms of the promissory note with additional repayment as a result of sales of homes collateralizing the mortgage loans constituting the security 
accordingly  management generally expects an average life of years for both collateralized mortgage obligations and pass through mortgage obligations 
other attributes of securities are discussed in interest sensitivity and market risk 
short term investments alabama national utilizes overnight investment of funds in federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell to ensure that adequate liquidity will be maintained  while at the same time minimizing the level of uninvested cash reserves 
short term investments are also utilized by alabama national when the level of funds committed to lending and investment portfolio programs changes or the level of deposit generation changes 
during  federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell averaged million  compared to million during  representing an increase of million 
trading account securities an important aspect of the investment services division s operations  but less so to alabama national overall  are trading account securities  which represent securities owned by alabama national prior to sale and delivery to alabama national s customers 
trading account securities averaged approximately million and million in and  respectively 
this small dollar amount reflects management s policy of limiting positions in such securities to reduce its exposure to market and interest rate changes 
deposits and other interest bearing liabilities average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  to billion in  from billion in average interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to billion in  from billion in the increase is attributable to competitive rate and product offerings by alabama national  successful marketing efforts and growth in many of alabama national s markets 
average federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased million  or  to million in  from million in  due in part to additional liquidity provided by downstream correspondent banks 
average short term borrowings increased by million  or  to million in  compared to million in average long term borrowings decreased million  or  to million in  from million in deposits average total deposits increased million  or  to billion during  from billion during at december   total deposits were billion  compared with billion at december  this growth in deposits  specifically interest bearing transaction accounts  savings and money market accounts and demand deposits allowed alabama national to support its loan growth with relatively low funding costs 
this contributed to an increased net interest margin for alabama national during the following table sets forth the deposits of alabama national by category at the dates indicated 
deposits amounts in thousands  except percentages december  amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total amount percent of total demand now savings and money market time less than  time greater than  total deposits core deposits  which exclude time deposits of  or more  provide for a relatively stable funding source that support earning assets 
alabama national s core deposits totaled billion  or  of total deposits at december   and totaled billion  or  of total deposits at december  deposits  in particular core deposits  have historically been alabama national s primary source of funding and have enabled alabama national to meet successfully both short term and long term liquidity needs 
management anticipates that such deposits will continue to be alabama national s primary source of funding in the future  although economic and competitive factors could affect this funding source 
alabama national s loan to deposit ratio was at december   and at the end of  and the ratio averaged during and during the maturity distribution of alabama national s time deposits in excess of  at december  is shown in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit and other time deposits of  or more amounts in thousands december  within one month after one through three months after three through six months after six through twelve months one through three years greater than three years total certificates of deposit of  or more other time deposits of  or more total approximately of alabama national s time deposits over  had scheduled maturities within three months 
large certificate of deposit customers tend to be sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
alabama national had million in large certificates of deposit obtained through brokers outstanding at december   compared to million at december  alabama national s use of brokered time deposits fluctuates depending upon funding needs and the pricing and maturity structure of available brokered deposits versus other funding sources  including in market time deposits 
borrowed funds borrowed funds include five broad categories  federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  treasury  tax and loan balances  federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  borrowings from a third party bank  and junior subordinated debentures 
because of a relatively high loan to deposit ratio  the existence and stability of these funding sources are critical to alabama national s maintenance of short term and long term liquidity 
federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent both an input of excess funds from correspondent bank customers of alabama national as well as a cash management tool offered to corporate customers 
at december   these funds totaled million  compared with million at december  this balance will vary greatly depending on the liquidity of the downstream correspondent banks of alabama national and the excess cash of its corporate customers

at december   the banks had available fhlb lines of billion  under which million was outstanding  including advances classified as short term of million and advances classified as long term of million 
this compares to borrowings of million at december   of which million was short term and million was long term 
alabama national through three separate trust subsidiaries has issued floating rate capital securities  commonly known as trust preferred securities  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
due to the adoption of fin the trusts created to issue the trust preferred securities must be deconsolidated and accordingly the debt is classified as junior subordinated debentures 
the debentures pay distributions at a rate that varies with libor 
they are classified as long term debt for the financial statements but are included as capital for regulatory purposes 
in addition to these junior subordinated debentures  alabama national assumed million in junior subordinated debentures in connection with its acquisition of indian river banking company in the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the principal components of borrowed funds

tier i capital consists of common stockholders equity  qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
in addition  under the guidelines  alabama national and the banks must maintain a minimum tier i leverage ratio of tier i capital to total assets of at least  but this minimum ratio is typically increased by to basis points for other than the highest rated institutions

liquidity management liquidity management involves monitoring alabama national s sources and uses of funds in order to meet its day to day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits 
liquidity represents the ability of an entity to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
without proper liquidity management  alabama national will not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would  therefore  not be able to meet the needs of the communities it serves 
increased liquidity in typical interest rate environments often involves decreasing profits by investing in earning assets with shorter maturities 
liquidity management is made more complex because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of certain securities within the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
assets included in alabama national s consolidated statements of condition contribute to liquidity management 
federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell  alabama national s primary source of immediate liquidity  averaged million during and were million at december   and averaged million during and were million at december  if required in short term liquidity management  these assets could be converted to cash immediately 
cash received from the repayment of investment securities and loans provides a repetitive source of cash that contributes to liquidity management 
unpledged securities  with a carrying value of approximately million at december   provide alabama national an opportunity to generate cash by  providing additional collateral by selling securities under agreements to repurchase  providing collateral to obtain public funds or providing collateral to borrow directly from the federal reserve bank or the federal home loan bank 
see earning assets loans and earning assets securities 
liquidity can also be managed using liabilities included in alabama national s consolidated statement of condition  such as federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short term borrowings 
combined federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  treasury  tax and loan  and short term borrowings averaged million during and were million at december   and averaged million during and were million at december  overnight borrowing lines with upstream correspondent banks  totaling million at december   of which million was unused  provide additional sources of liquidity to alabama national on an unsecured basis 
the federal home loan bank provides secured credit lines to all of alabama national s banks totaling approximately billion as of year end the amount that alabama national can borrow from the federal home loan bank is limited to the actual collateral pledged 
at december   advances under these lines totaled million  including million classified as short term and million classified as long term 
long term liquidity needs are met through alabama national s deposit base approximately of alabama national s deposits at december   are considered core deposits  and the repayment of loans and other investments as they mature 
alabama national is able to manage its long term liquidity needs by adjusting the rates it pays on longer term deposits  long term borrowings and the amount and mix of longer term investments in its portfolio 
one of the banks  first american bank  pledged approximately million in loans to the federal reserve bank of atlanta as collateral for a discount window credit facility  which management views as a backup liquidity facility 
at december   first american bank had access to approximately million under this facility  with no outstanding borrowings 
alabama national  as a stand alone corporation  has more limited access to liquidity sources than its banks and depends on dividends from its subsidiaries as its primary source of liquidity 
alabama national s liquidity is diminished by required payments on its outstanding short term debt and junior subordinated debentures 
the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to general regulatory restrictions  which may  but are not expected to  have a material negative impact on the liquidity available to alabama national 
see note to alabama national s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report beginning at page f 
if circumstances warrant  alabama national s short term liquidity needs can also be met by additional borrowings of approximately million representing the unused portion of alabama national s credit facility with an unrelated bank

in march  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on issue  the meaning of other than temporary and its application to certain investments 
the issue applies to debt and equity securities within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  certain debt and equity securities within the scope of sfas  accounting for certain investments held by not for profit organizations  and equity securities that are not subject to the scope of sfas and not accounted for under the equity method of accounting ie  cost method investments 
issue outlines a three step model for assessing other than temporary impairment 
the model involves first determining whether an investment is impaired  then evaluating whether the impairment is other than temporary  and if it is  recognizing an impairment loss equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
the model was to be applied prospectively to all current and future investments in interim or annual reporting periods beginning after june  however  in september the financial accounting standards board fasb staff issued fasb staff position fsp eitf issue which delayed the effective date for measurement and recognition guidance contained in issue until such time as additional implementation guidance could be provided 
on november   fsp fas was issued 
the fsp nullifies certain requirements of issue and supersedes eitf topic d the fsp clarifies that investors shall recognize an impairment loss no later than when any impairment is deemed to be other than temporary  even if a decision to sell the investment has not been made 
the fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  the changes required by fsp are not expected to have a material impact on alabama national s financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas  statement of cash flows 
generally the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on fair values 
sfas r was originally effective for interim or annual periods beginning after june  however  in april the securities and exchange commission sec amended this requirement allowing companies to adopt the standard at the beginning of their next fiscal year that begins after june  early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
alabama national currently uses a fair value based method of accounting for compensation costs and has fully adopted and implemented the expense recognition provisions of sfas accordingly  the changes required by sfas r did not have a material impact on alabama national s financial condition or results of operations 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment  which provides interpretive guidance on various issues in sfas r  particularly valuation methodologies and the selection of assumptions 
this sab also discusses the sec staff s expectations regarding disclosures in management s discussion and analysis related to share based payment transactions  as well as the interaction of sfas r with existing sec guidance  such as that dealing with disclosure of non gaap financial measures 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
it applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement that does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas eliminates the requirement in apb opinion no 
to include the cumulative effect changes in accounting principle in the income statement in the period of change 
instead  to enhance comparability of prior period financial statements  sfas requires that changes in accounting principle be retrospectively applied 
under retrospective application  the new accounting principle is applied as of the beginning of the first period presented as if that principle had always been used 
the cumulative effect of the change is reflected in the carrying value of assets and liabilities as of the first period presented and the offsetting adjustments are recorded to opening retained earnings 
each period presented is adjusted to reflect the period specific effects of applying the change 
although retrospective application is similar to restating prior periods  sfas gives the treatment a new name to differentiate it from restatement for correction of an error 
only direct effects of the change will be included in the retrospective application  all indirect effects will be recognized in the period of change 
if it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect for all periods  the new accounting principle should be applied as if it were adopted prospectively from the earliest date practicable 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date sfas was issued 
impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as alabama national and its subsidiaries are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on alabama national s performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
management seeks to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation

industry developments certain recently enacted and proposed legislation could have an effect on both the costs of doing business and the competitive factors facing the financial institutions industry 
alabama national is unable at this time to assess the impact of this legislation on its financial condition or results of operations
