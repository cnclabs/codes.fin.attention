table of contents north american shipments 
our north american order backlog as of december  was approximately  railcars  or approximately of the total north american backlog as reported by the railway supply institute  inc trinity rail gmbh is a freight railcar manufacturer in europe with its primary manufacturing facility located in romania 
we entered the european railcar manufacturing business in with our acquisition of a large government owned romanian railcar manufacturer 
immediately after the acquisition  we initiated a multi step program designed to substantially upgrade and improve the infrastructure of the facility 
in addition  we installed new railcar manufacturing tooling and equipment and began transferring our best practices 
following our merger with thrall  which also had european facilities  we initiated a consolidation program and continued the transfer of best practices for the combined companies 
in europe we compete against a number of manufacturers in various countries 
for the year ended december   trinity rail gmbh shipped approximately  railcars 
in the european market  there is no formal collection of information pertaining to railcar shipments 
however  we believe our current european market share is approximately 
our european backlog as of december  was approximately railcars 
we hold patents of varying duration for use in our manufacture of railcar and component products 
we believe patents offer a marketing advantage in certain circumstances 
no material revenues are received from licensing of these patents

we are a leading manufacturer of inland barges in the united states and the largest manufacturer of fiberglass barge covers used primarily on grain barges 
in  we shipped approximately barges 
we manufacture a variety of dry cargo barges  such as deck barges  and open or covered hopper barges that transport various commodities  such as grain  coal  and aggregates 
we also manufacture tank barges used to transport liquid products 
fiberglass reinforced lift covers are primarily for grain and rolling covers are for other bulk commodities 
our four barge manufacturing facilities are located along the united states inland river system allowing for rapid delivery to our customers 
our primary inland barge customers are commercial marine transportation companies 
many companies have the capability to enter into  and from time to time do enter into  the inland barge manufacturing business 
we strive to compete through efficiency in operations and quality of product 
energy equipment group 
in the third quarter of  due to an increase in structural wind tower revenue  the company restructured its industrial products group to include the company s structural wind tower operations 
this increase in revenue is due  in part  to the recent signing of the energy policy act of which provides production tax credits on wind generated energy 
as a result  the structural wind tower operations  previously included in the all other segment  are now included in the energy equipment group previously  the industrial products group 
segment information for prior periods has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
we are a leading manufacturer of tank containers and tank heads for pressure vessels 
we manufacture tanks in the united states  mexico  and brazil 
we market a portion of our products in mexico under the brand name of tatsa 
we manufacture propane tanks that are used by industrial plants  utilities  small businesses and in suburban and rural areas 
we also manufacture fertilizer containers for bulk storage  farm storage and the application and distribution of anhydrous ammonia 
our propane tank products range from gallon tanks for motor fuel use to  gallon bulk storage spheres

in the us we generally deliver the containers to our customers who install and fill the containers 
our competitors include large and small manufacturers of tanks 
we manufacture tank heads  which are pressed metal components used in the manufacturing of 
table of contents many of our finished products 
we manufacture the tank heads in various shapes  and we produce pressure rated or non pressure rated tank heads  depending on their intended use 
we use a significant portion of the tank heads we manufacture in the production of our tank cars and containers 
we also sell our tank heads to a broad range of other manufacturers 
there is strong competition in the tank heads business 
we are a leading manufacturer of structural wind towers in the united states 
we manufacture structural wind tower shells for use in the wind energy market 
these towers are manufactured in the us to customer specifications and installed by our customers 
our customers are original equipment manufacturers who assemble and install our towers with the remaining equipment to produce wind generated electricity 
all other 
all other includes our captive insurance and transportation companies  costs associated with non operating plants  and other peripheral businesses 
foreign operations 
trinity s foreign operations are in brazil  czech republic  mexico  romania  slovakia  and the united kingdom 
sales to foreign customers  primarily in europe and mexico  represented   and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december    and  we had approximately   and of our long lived assets located outside the united states 
we manufacture railcars  propane tank containers  tank heads  and other parts at our mexico facilities for export to the united states 
any material change in the quotas  regulations  or duties on imports imposed by the united states government and its agencies or on exports imposed by the government of mexico or its agencies could adversely affect our operations in mexico 
our foreign activities are also subject to various other risks of doing business in foreign countries  including currency fluctuations  political changes  changes in laws and regulations  and economic instability 
although our operations have not been materially affected by any of such factors to date  any substantial disruption of business as it is currently conducted could adversely affect our operations at least in the short term 
backlog 
as of december   our backlog for new railcars was  million and was million for inland barge products 
included in the railcar backlog are million of railcars to be sold to our railcar leasing and management services group 
the substantial portion of our backlog is expected to be delivered in the months ending december  the rail group has a multi year sales agreement with  new railcars remaining for which will not be included in the backlog until the type of car and price have been determined 
in january  the inland barge group entered into a multi year sales agreement for dry cargo barges with deliveries beginning in which are not included in the backlog at this time as the production quantity may vary 
as of december   our backlog for new railcars was  million and was million for inland barge products 
included in the railcar backlog was million of railcars to be sold to our railcar leasing and management services group 
marketing 
we sell substantially all of our products through our own sales personnel operating from offices in the following states and foreign countries arkansas  arizona  connecticut  florida  georgia  illinois  kentucky  louisiana  ohio  oklahoma  pennsylvania  tennessee  texas  utah  washington  brazil  canada  czech republic  france  mexico  romania  slovakia  switzerland  and the united kingdom 
we also use independent sales representatives to a limited extent 
except in the case of weld fittings  guardrail  and standard size propane tank containers  we ordinarily fabricate our products to our customers specifications contained in a purchase order 
raw materials and suppliers 
railcar specialty components and steel 
products manufactured at our railcar manufacturing facilities require a significant supply of raw materials such as steel  as well as numerous specialty components such as brakes  wheels  axles  side frames  bolsters  and bearings 
specialty components purchased from third parties comprise approximately of the production cost of each railcar 
although the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years  at least three suppliers continue to produce most components 
however  any unanticipated interruption in the supply chain of specialty components 
table of contents would have an impact on both our margin and production schedules 
the current production level of railcar specialty components would not allow for significant expansion of railcar production 
the principal material used in our rail  inland barge  and energy equipment groups is steel 
during  the prices of steel we purchased increased at a much lower rate than was evident in the prices for other component parts we purchased in increased significantly and have been volatile on a month to month basis 
we used escalation clauses and other arrangements to reduce the impact of these cost increases  thus minimizing the effect on our operating margins for the year 
as of december   approximately of the railcar backlog was covered by escalation clauses or other arrangements which reduced the exposure to future material cost increases related to those contracts 
availability of steel has improved significantly during  while the availability of other components continues to be an issue 
in general  we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels 
we believe the existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain would have an impact on both our margin and production schedules 
aggregates 
aggregates can be found throughout the united states  and many producers exist nationwide 
however  as a general rule  shipments from an individual quarry are limited in geographic scope because the cost of transporting processed aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value of the product itself 
we operate mining facilities strategically located in texas  oklahoma  and louisiana to fulfill some of our needs for aggregates 
we have experienced some difficulty due to shipping issues  in fulfilling the rest of our needs from local suppliers 
cement 
the worldwide demand for cement has increased over the last several years 
the supply of cement for the concrete aggregates business is received primarily from texas and overseas 
the increased demand  coupled with rising transportation costs  has driven the cost of this raw material up over in the last year 
although rising cost continues to impact our business  we have not experienced difficulties supplying concrete to our customers 
employees 
the following table presents the breakdown of employees by business group december  business group rail group construction products group inland barge group energy equipment group railcar leasing and management services group all other corporate as of december   approximately  employees were employed in the united states 
acquisitions 
in  we did not make any acquisitions 
in  we had an acquisition in the construction products group with a purchase price of million 
during  we had six acquisitions primarily in the construction products group with a combined purchase price  net of cash acquired  of million 
the acquired operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective dates of the acquisitions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the company acquired thrall car manufacturing company from an affiliate of duchossois industries  inc for million in cash and million in shares of common stock 
in  duchossois industries  inc sold million shares of common stock 
the company has received a request from various entities affiliated with duchossois industries  inc to register million shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of a demand registration right entered into in connection with such acquisition 
the company is in the process of complying with its obligations pursuant to this demand 
this will fulfill the company s obligation to register common stock under this agreement 
environmental matters 
we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment  the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport  or disposal of hazardous and non hazardous waste and materials  or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the 
table of contents environment 
such laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for our own acts  but also may expose us to liability for the acts of others or for our actions which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken 
in addition  such laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law 
environmental operating permits are  or may be  required for our operations under these laws and regulations 
these operating permits are subject to modification  renewal  and revocation 
we regularly monitor and review our operations  procedures  and policies for compliance with these laws and regulations 
despite these compliance efforts  risk of environmental liability is inherent in the operation of our businesses  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses 
we believe that our operations and facilities owned  managed  or leased  are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
however  future events such as changes in or modified interpretations of existing laws and regulations or enforcement policies  or further investigation or evaluation of the potential health hazards associated with our products  business activities  or properties  may give rise to additional compliance and other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
in addition to environmental laws  the transportation of commodities by railcar or barge raises potential risks in the event of a derailment  spill  or other accident 
generally  liability under existing law in the united states for a derailment  spill  or other accident depends on the negligence of the party  such as the railroad  the shipper  or the manufacturer of the barge  railcar  or its components 
however  under certain circumstances strict liability concepts may apply 
governmental regulation 
railcar industry 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the railcar industry are the environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration  a division of the department of transportation  the federal railroad administration  a division of the department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars and railcar parts  mechanical  maintenance  and related standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks  and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous materials 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these regulations 
we cannot predict whether any future changes in these rules and regulations could cause added compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operations 
inland barge industry 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the barge industry are the united states coast guard  the national transportation safety board  the united states customs service  the maritime administration of the united states department of transportation  and private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents  and recommend safety standards 
violations of these laws and related regulations can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations 
we cannot predict whether future changes that affect compliance costs would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
highway products 
the primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of our highway products business are the united states department of transportation  the federal highway administration  and various state highway departments 
these organizations establish certain standards and specifications related to the manufacture of our highway products 
if our products were found not to be in compliance with these standards and 
table of contents specifications we would be required to re qualify our products for installation on state and national highways 
we believe that our highway products are in substantial compliance with all applicable standards and specifications 
we cannot predict whether future changes in these standards and specifications would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
occupational safety and health administration and similar regulations 
our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the united states occupational safety and health administration 
we believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities 
however  claims may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury  and our operations may be adversely affected by the further adoption of occupational health and safety regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
while we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us 
other matters 
to date  we have not suffered any material shortages with respect to obtaining sufficient energy supplies to operate our various plant facilities or transportation vehicles 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles  could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business 
the likelihood of such an occurrence or its duration  and its ultimate effect on our operations  cannot be reasonably predicted at this time

risk factors 
we caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases  reports  proxy statements  registration statements  and other written communications  as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by representatives of our company 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the risks described below 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
the cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business  financial condition  operating results  and cash flows to be materially adversely affected 
the cyclical nature of our business results in lower revenues during economic downturns 
we operate in cyclical industries 
downturns in overall economic conditions usually have a significant adverse effect on cyclical industries due to decreased demand for new and replacement products 
decreased demand could continue to result in lower sales volumes  lower prices  and or a loss of profits 
the railcar  barge  and wind tower industries recently experienced a deep down cycle and operated with a minimal backlog 
if this down cycle were to return  we could experience losses and close plants  suspend production  and incur related costs 
litigation claims could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition 
we and our subsidiaries are currently and may from time to time be involved in various legal proceedings arising out of our operations 
adverse outcomes in some or all of the claims pending against us could result in significant monetary damages against us that could increase our costs and weaken our financial condition 
while we maintain reserves and liability insurance at coverage levels based upon commercial norms in our industries  our reserves may be inadequate to cover these claims or lawsuits or any future claims or lawsuits arising from our businesses  and any such claims or lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or overall financial condition 
increases in the price and demand for steel could lower our margins and profitability 
the principal material used in our rail  inland barge and energy equipment groups is steel 
during  the prices of steel we purchased increased at a much lower rate than was evident in the prices for other component parts we purchased in increased significantly and have been volatile on a month to month basis 
we used escalation clauses and other arrangements to reduce the impact of these cost increases  thus minimizing the effect on our operating margins for the year 
as of december   approximately of the 
table of contents railcar backlog is covered by escalation clauses or other arrangements which reduce the exposure to future material cost increases related to these contracts 
availability of steel has improved significantly during  while the availability of other components continues to be an issue 
in general  we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels 
we believe our existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain would have an impact on both our margin and production schedules 
we have potential exposure to environmental liabilities  which may increase costs and lower profitability 
our operations are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations  including those dealing with air quality and the handling and disposal of waste products  fuel products  and hazardous substances 
in particular  we may incur remediation costs and other related expenses because some of our manufacturing facilities were constructed and operated before the adoption of current environmental laws and the institution of compliance practices  and some of the products that we manufacture are used to transport hazardous materials 
furthermore  although we intend to conduct appropriate due diligence with respect to environmental matters in connection with future acquisitions  we may be unable to identify or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business 
environmental liabilities incurred by us  if not covered by adequate insurance or indemnification will increase our respective costs and have a negative impact on our profitability 
we compete in highly competitive industries  which may impact our respective financial results 
we face aggressive competition in all geographic markets and each industry sector in which we operate 
as a result  competition on pricing is often intense 
the effect of this competition could reduce our revenues  limit our ability to grow  increase pricing pressure on our products  and otherwise affect our financial results 
if our railcar leasing subsidiary is unable to obtain acceptable long term financing of its railcar lease fleet  our lenders may foreclose on the portion of our lease fleet that secures our warehouse facility 
tilc  our wholly owned captive leasing subsidiary  uses borrowings under a warehouse facility to initially finance the railcars it purchases from us 
borrowings under the warehouse facility are secured by the specific railcars financed by such borrowings and the underlying leases 
the warehouse facility is non recourse to us and to our other subsidiaries other than trinity rail leasing trust ii  or trl ii  a qualified subsidiary of tilc that is the borrower under the warehouse facility 
borrowings under the warehouse facility are available through august  and unless renewed would be payable in three equal installments in february  august  and february a decline in the value of the railcars securing borrowings under the warehouse facility or in the creditworthiness of the lessees under the associated leases could reduce trl ii s ability to obtain long term financing for such railcars 
additionally  fluctuations in interest rates from the time trl ii purchases railcars with short term borrowings under the warehouse facility and the time trl ii obtains permanent financing for such railcars could decrease our profitability on the leasing of the railcars and could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
if trl ii is unable to obtain long term financing to replace borrowings under the warehouse facility  trinity may decide to satisfy trl ii s indebtedness under the warehouse facility or the lenders under the warehouse facility may foreclose on the portion of trl ii s lease fleet pledged to secure this facility 
as of december   there was million of indebtedness outstanding and million was available under the warehouse facility 
we may be unable to remarket leased railcars on favorable terms  which could result in lower lease utilization rates and reduced revenues 
the profitability of our railcar leasing business is dependent in part on our ability to re lease or sell railcars we own upon the expiration of existing lease terms 
our ability to remarket leased railcars profitably is dependent upon several factors  including  among others the cost of and demand for newer models  the availability in the market generally of other used or new railcars  
table of contents the degree of obsolescence of leased railcars  prevailing market and economic conditions  including interest and inflation rates  the need for refurbishment  the cost of materials and labor  and volume of railcar traffic 
a downturn in the industries in which our lessees operate and decreased demand for railcars could also increase our exposure to remarket risk because lessees may demand shorter lease terms  requiring us to remarket leased railcars more frequently 
furthermore  the resale market for previously leased railcars has a limited number of potential buyers 
our inability to re lease or sell leased railcars on favorable terms could result in lower lease utilization rates and reduced revenues 
fluctuations in the supply of component parts used in the production of our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to cost effectively manufacture and sell our products 
a significant portion of our business depends on the adequate supply of numerous specialty components such as brakes  wheels  side frames  bolsters  and bearings at competitive prices 
we depend on third party suppliers for a significant portion of our component part needs 
specialty components comprise a significant portion of the production cost of each railcar we manufacture 
due to consolidations and challenging industry conditions  the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years  though generally a minimum of three suppliers continue to produce each type of component we use in our products 
while we endeavor to be diligent in contractual relationships with our suppliers  a significant decrease in the availability of specialty components could materially increase our cost of goods sold or prevent us from manufacturing our products on a timely basis 
reductions in the availability of energy supplies or an increase in energy costs may increase our operating costs 
we use natural gas at our manufacturing facilities and use diesel fuel in vehicles to transport our products to customers and to operate our plant equipment 
over the past three years  prices for natural gas have fluctuated significantly 
an outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the united states and any foreign power and  in particular  a prolonged armed conflict in the middle east  could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and or natural gas  which could result in an increase in the cost of natural gas or energy in general 
as experienced in  hurricanes or other natural disasters could result in a real or perceived shortage of petroleum and or natural gas  which could result in an increase in natural gas prices or general energy costs 
future limitations on the availability or consumption of petroleum products and or an increase in energy costs  particularly natural gas for plant operations and diesel fuel for vehicles and plant equipment  could have an adverse effect upon our ability to conduct our business cost effectively 
our manufacturer s warranties expose us to potentially significant claims 
depending on the product  we warrant against manufacturing defects due to our workmanship and certain materials pursuant to express limited contractual warranties 
accordingly  we may be subject to significant warranty claims in the future such as multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout our mass production process or claims for which the cost of repairing the defective part is highly disproportionate to the original cost of the part 
these types of warranty claims could result in costly product recalls  significant repair costs  and damage to our reputation 
increasing insurance claims and expenses could lower profitability and increase business risk 
the nature of our business subjects us to product liability  property damage  and personal injury claims  especially in connection with the repair and manufacture of products that transport hazardous or volatile materials 
we maintain reserves and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms in the industries in which we operate and our historical claims experience 
over the last several years  insurance carriers have raised premiums for many companies operating in our industries 
increased premiums may further increase our insurance expense as coverage expires or otherwise cause us to raise our self insured retention 
if the number or severity of claims within our self insured retention increases  we could suffer costs in excess of our reserves 
an unusually large liability claim or a string of claims based on a failure repeated throughout our mass production process may exceed our insurance coverage or result in direct damages if we were unable or elected not to insure against certain hazards because of high premiums or other reasons 
in addition  the availability of  and our ability to 
table of contents collect on  insurance coverage is often subject to factors beyond our control 
moreover  any accident or incident involving us  even if we are fully insured or not held to be liable  could negatively affect our reputation among customers and the public  thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively  and could significantly affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future 
risks related to our operations outside of the united states could decrease our profitability 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to the risks associated with cross border business transactions and activities 
political  legal  trade  or economic changes or instability could limit or curtail our respective foreign business activities and operations 
some foreign countries where we operate have regulatory authorities that regulate railroad safety  railcar design and railcar component part design  performance  and manufacture of equipment used on their railroad systems 
if we fail to obtain and maintain certifications of our railcars and railcar parts within the various foreign countries where we operate  we may be unable to market and sell our railcars in those countries 
in addition  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  more stringent rules relating to labor or the environment  adverse tax consequences  and price exchange controls could limit operations and make the manufacture and distribution of our products difficult 
furthermore  any material change in the quotas  regulations  or duties on imports imposed by the us government and agencies or on exports by the government of mexico or its agencies could affect our ability to export the railcars and propane tanks that we manufacture in mexico 
because we do not have employment contracts with our key management employees  we may not be able to retain their services in the future 
our success depends on the continued services of our key management employees  none of whom currently have employment agreements with us 
although we have historically been successful in retaining the services of our key management  we may not be able to do so in the future 
the loss of the services of one or more key members of our management team could result in increased costs associated with attracting and retaining a replacement and could disrupt our operations and result in a loss of revenues 
repercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm our business 
terrorist activities  anti terrorist efforts  and other armed conflict involving the united states or its interests abroad may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations 
in particular  the negative impacts of these events may affect the industries in which we operate 
this could result in delays in or cancellations of the purchase of our products or shortages in raw materials or component parts 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse impact on our operating results  revenues and costs 
violations of or changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to the industries in which we operate may increase our operating costs 
we are subject to extensive regulation by governmental regulatory and industry authorities 
our railcar operations are subject to regulation by the environmental protection agency  the research and special programs administration  a division of the department of transportation  the federal railroad administration  a division of the department of transportation  and the association of american railroads 
these organizations establish rules and regulations for the railcar industry  including construction specifications and standards for the design and manufacture of railcars  mechanical  maintenance  and related standards for railcars  safety of railroad equipment  tracks  and operations  and packaging and transportation of hazardous materials 
future changes that affect compliance costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
our inland barge operations are subject to regulation by the united states coast guard  the national transportation safety board  the united states customs service  the maritime administration of the united states department of transportation  and private industry organizations such as the american bureau of shipping 
these organizations establish safety criteria  investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
violations of these regulations and related laws can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties as well as injunctions curtailing operations 
our operations are also subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the united states occupations safety and health administration 
we believe that we employ appropriate precautions to 
table of contents protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities 
however  claims that may be asserted against us for work related illnesses or injury  and the further adoption of occupational health and safety regulations in the united states or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs 
we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these health and safety laws and regulations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceedings  that such costs would not be material to us 
we may be required to reduce our inventory carrying values  which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we are required to record our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
we have recorded reductions in inventory carrying values in recent periods due to discontinuance of product lines as well as changes in market conditions due to changes in demand requirements 
we may be required to reduce inventory carrying values in the future due to a decline in market conditions in the railcar and inland barge businesses  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to reduce the value of our long lived assets and or goodwill  which would weaken our results of operations 
we periodically evaluate the carrying values of our long lived assets to be held and used for potential impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available 
impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for the estimated cost to dispose of the assets 
in addition  we are required  at least annually  to evaluate goodwill related to acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators that are based primarily on market conditions in the united states and europe and the operational performance of our reporting units 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss related to reductions in the value of our long lived assets or our goodwill could weaken our financial condition and results of operations 
due to the performance of its european operations  sales order activity  and the status of the european backlog in the second quarter of  the company performed an impairment analysis of the long lived assets of these operations 
based on this review  the company recorded a charge of million to write off all of the goodwill related to these operations as of june  in the fourth quarter of  the company updated this analysis based on revised cash flow forecasts 
such forecasts indicated the carrying value of property  plant  and equipment related to the european operations was impaired 
as a result  the company recorded a charge of million to write down these assets to their estimated fair value based on the company s estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the estimates of future cash flows are based on assumptions that the company believes are reasonable 
however  actual operations will differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the company will continue to evaluate its european operations  as necessary  to determine if there has been any additional impairment of the carrying value of the property  plant  and equipment 
as of december   the company has property  plant  and equipment with a net book value of approximately million related to its european operations 
the impairment charges related to the european operations are included in the operating profit of the rail group for we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we seek to minimize these risks  when considered appropriate  through the use of currency and interest rate hedges and similar financial instruments and other activities  although these measures may not be implemented or effective 
any material and untimely changes in interest rates or exchange rates could result in significant losses to us

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary operations trinity industries  inc is a diversified industrial company providing a variety of products and services for the transportation  construction  and energy sectors of the marketplace 
we operate in five distinct business groups which we report on a segment basis the rail group  construction products group  inland barge group  energy equipment group  and railcar leasing and management services group leasing group 
we also report all other which includes the company s captive insurance and transportation companies our other peripheral businesses 
during the third quarter of  the company restructured its industrial products group to include the company s structural wind tower operations as a result of the increase in structural wind tower revenue 
the increase in revenue is due  in part  to the recent signing of the energy policy act of  which provides production tax credits on wind generated energy 
as a result  the structural wind tower operations  previously included in the all other segment  are now included in the energy equipment group previously  the industrial products group 
segment information for prior periods has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
we operate in cyclical industries 
in  we continued to witness the increase in industrial activity and signs of improvement in the manufacturing sector that we began seeing in we continue to assess our manufacturing capacity and take steps to adjust our production facilities in line with the nature of the demand 
the improvement in industrial and manufacturing activity is reflected in the increase in our new railcar shipments  which resulted in an increase in revenues of approximately 
although we ended with a slightly lower backlog in our rail group with an approximate  railcar decrease year over year  our backlog remains strong at approximately  railcars 
in addition  improvement in the rail industry was seen in our leasing group  where leasing revenues in increased by  fueled by sales from the lease fleet  growth in the size of the lease fleet  and improvement in fleet utilization 
global insight  an independent industry research firm  has estimated the average age of the north american freight car fleet is approximately years  with over older than years and has estimated that us carload traffic will expand by about per year through global insight believes that this modest growth in rail carload traffic and the potential for additional growth will allow and encourage equipment owners to replace older smaller units in their fleets and expand capacity where needed 
the table below is a composite of the industries estimates of railcar deliveries for the next years trinity industries leasing company tilc purchases a portion of our railcar production  financing a portion of the purchase price through a non recourse warehouse lending facility and periodically refinancing those borrowings through sale leaseback and other leveraged lease or equipment financing transactions 
in  tilc purchases represented approximately of our north american railcar production  up from in this percentage increase is the result of a strategic decision to grow the lease fleet 
on a segment basis  sales to tilc and related profits are included in the operating results of our rail group but are eliminated in consolidation 
railcar specialty components and steel products manufactured at our railcar manufacturing facilities require a significant supply of raw materials such as steel  as well as numerous specialty components such as brakes  wheels  axles  side frames  bolsters  and bearings 
specialty components purchased from third parties comprise approximately of the production cost of each railcar 
although the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years  at least three suppliers continue to produce most components 
however  any unanticipated interruption in the supply chain of specialty components would have an impact on both our margin and production schedules 
the current production level of railcar specialty components would not allow for significant expansion of railcar production 

table of contents the principal material used in our rail  inland barge  and energy equipment groups is steel 
during  the prices of steel we purchased increased at a much lower rate than was evident in the prices for other component parts we purchased in increased significantly and have been volatile on a month to month basis 
we used escalation clauses and other arrangements to reduce the impact of these costs increases  thus minimizing the effect on our operating margins for the year 
as of december   approximately of the railcar backlog is covered by escalation clauses or other arrangements which reduce the exposure to future material cost increases related to those contracts 
availability of steel has improved significantly during  while the availability of other components continues to be an issue 
in general  we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels 
we believe our existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts 
however  any unanticipated interruption in our supply chain would have an impact on both our margin and production schedules 
financing activity in april  the million secured revolving credit facility was extended and expanded to provide for a five year  million secured revolving credit facility 
two of the financial covenants  the asset coverage ratio and the capital expenditure limitation  were eliminated  while the permitted leverage ratio was increased 
in august  trinity industries leasing company tilc extended its million non recourse warehouse facility through august in october  this facility was increased to million 
this facility was established to finance railcars owned by tilc 
in anticipation of a future debt issuance  the company entered into interest rate swap transactions during the third and fourth quarters of these instruments  with a notional amount of million  fix the interest rate on a future debt issuance associated with an anticipated secured borrowing facility in and will expire in the first quarter of the weighted average fixed interest rate under these instruments is 
these interest rate swaps are being accounted for as cash flow hedges with changes in the fair value of the instruments recorded in other comprehensive income 
in february  the company notified the holder of the series b preferred stock that it was converting the shares of series b preferred stock into  shares of the company s common stock 
the series b preferred stock did convert in february as the series b preferred stock was already treated as if converted in the calculation of diluted net income applicable to common shareholders  there is no impact on reported diluted net income applicable to common shareholders

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  property  plant  and equipment  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  insurance  restructuring costs  contingencies  and litigation 
management bases its estimates and 
table of contents judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
our policy related to excess and obsolete inventory requires the inventory to be analyzed at the business unit level on a quarterly basis and record required adjustments 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in required inventory reserves may occur in the future due to then current market conditions 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used for potential impairment 
the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used is considered impaired when the carrying value is not recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows and the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks involved or market quotes as available 
impairment losses on long lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for the estimated cost to dispose of the assets 
goodwill we are required  at least annually  to evaluate goodwill related to acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators that are based primarily on market conditions in the united states and europe and the operational performance of our reporting units 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
warranties we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue related to products covered by warranties assumed 
we base our estimates on historical warranty claims 
we also provide for specifically identified warranty obligations 
should actual claim rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
insurance we are effectively self insured for workers compensation claims 
a third party administrator processes all such claims 
we accrue our workers compensation liability based upon independent actuarial studies 
to the extent actuarial assumptions change and claims experience rates differ from historical rates  our liability may change 
trinity has casualty insurance polices that include coverage for product liability claims against the company 
we feel that the level of coverage we maintain under these policies provides adequate protection to the company against a materially adverse impact on the company s financial condition 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  as of december   we have accrued our estimate of the probable settlement or judgment costs for the resolution of certain of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 

table of contents environmental we are involved in various proceedings related to environmental matters 
we have provided reserves to cover probable and estimable liabilities with respect to such proceedings  taking into account currently available information and our contractual rights of indemnification 
however  estimates of future response costs are necessarily imprecise 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings or  if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  that such costs would not be material to us 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 inventory costs  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material 
sfas no 
will be effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our results from operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of non monetary assets  which eliminates the exception for non monetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of non monetary assets that do not have a commercial substance 
sfas no 
became effective for non monetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  sfas no 
r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard 
although early adoption is allowed  we will adopt sfas no 
r as of the required effective date for calendar year companies  which is january  we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas no 
r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a more complex binomial  or lattice model 
based upon our research on the alternative models available to value option grants  and in conjunction with the type and number of stock options expected to be issued in the future  the company has determined that it will continue to use the black scholes model for option valuation as of the current time 
sfas no 
r includes several modifications to the way that income taxes are recorded in the financial statements 
the expense for certain types of option grants is only deductible for tax purposes at the time that the taxable event takes place  which could cause variability in the company s effective tax rates recorded throughout the year 
sfas no 
r does not allow companies to predict when these taxable events will take place 
furthermore  it requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
however  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for tax deductions  as shown in the company s consolidated statement of cash flows  were million  million  and million  respectively  for   and sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
we will adopt the modified prospective method  whereby compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
based on stock options granted to 
table of contents employees through december   we expect that the adoption of sfas no 
r on january  will reduce net earnings for by approximately million per diluted share 
in march   the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 

this interpretation clarifies the term conditional asset retirement and requires recognition of a liability for the fair value of the conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liability s fair value can be reasonably estimated 
this interpretation is effective as of december  the adoption of fin no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
forward looking statements some statements in this form k or otherwise made by the company or on the company s behalf from time to time in other reports  filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases  conferences  world wide web postings or otherwise which are not historical facts  may be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of and the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include statements about trinity s estimates  expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies for the future  and the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements 
trinity uses the words anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  forecasts  may  will  should  and similar expressions to identify these forward looking statements 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or our present expectations 
factors that could cause these differences include  but are not limited to market conditions and demand for our products  the cyclical nature of both the railcar and barge industries  variations in weather in areas where construction products are sold and used  disruptions of manufacturing capacity due to weather related events  the timing of introduction of new products  the timing of customer orders  price changes  changes in mix of products sold  the extent of utilization of manufacturing capacity  availability and costs of component parts  supplies and raw materials  competition and other competitive factors  changing technologies  steel prices  surcharges added to fixed pricing agreements for raw materials  interest rates and capital costs  long term funding of our leasing warehouse facility  taxes  the stability of the governments and political and business conditions in certain foreign countries  particularly mexico  the czech republic and romania  changes in import and export quotas and regulations  business conditions in emerging economies  results of litigation  and legal  regulatory  and environmental issues 
any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made 
trinity undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings could be affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our variable rate debt obligations  which represented approximately of our total debt as of december  we have hedged of this exposure with interest rate swaps leaving of our total debt exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
if interest rates average one percentage point more in fiscal year than they did during in  and our debt level remained constant  our 
table of contents interest expense would increase by million 
in comparison  at december   we estimated that if interest rates averaged one percentage point more in fiscal year than they did during the year ended december   our interest expense would not have increased as all our variable debt was hedged 
the impact of an increase in interest rates was determined based on the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates and scheduled principal payments on our variable rate debt obligations as of december  and in addition  we are subject to market risk related to our net investments in our foreign subsidiaries 
the net investment in foreign subsidiaries as of december  is million 
however  the impact of such market risk exposures as a result of foreign exchange rate fluctuations has not been material to us
