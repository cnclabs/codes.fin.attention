quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management it is the objective of the company to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory  consistent level of profitability within the framework of established cash  loan  investment  borrowing and capital policies 
the bank s management is responsible for monitoring policies and procedures that are designed to ensure acceptable composition of the asset liability mix  stability and leverage of all sources of funds while adhering to prudent banking practices 
it is the overall philosophy of management to support asset growth through fhlb advances  borrowings  and most importantly  core deposits  which include deposits of all categories made by individuals  partnerships and corporations 
management of the company seeks to invest the largest portion of its assets in residential  commercial  and consumer loans 
the asset liability mix is monitored on a monthly basis and a monthly report reflecting interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities is prepared and presented to the bank s board of directors 
the objective of this policy is to control interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the impact of substantial movements in interest rates on the bank s earnings 
our profitability  like that of most bank holding companies and financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between our interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and our interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings 
financial institutions are affected by general changes in levels of interest rates and other economic factors beyond their control 
at december   our cumulative  one year interest sensitivity gap the difference between the amount of interest earning assets anticipated to mature or reprice within one year and the amount of interest bearing liabilities anticipated to mature or reprice within one year as a percentage of total assets was a negative  while our three month gap was virtually matched with million assets and million in liabilities scheduled or eligible for repricing 
generally  an institution with a negative gap would experience a decrease in net interest income in a period of rising interest rates or an increase in net interest income in a period of declining interest rates since there will be more liabilities than assets that will either mature or be subject to repricing within the one year period 
however  certain shortcomings are inherent in this rate sensitivity analysis 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different manners to changes in market interest rates 
therefore  no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain our net interest rate spread as market interest rates fluctuate 
we monitor our interest rate risk through the asset liability committee which meets regularly and reports the results of the meetings to the board of directors 
our policy is to seek to maintain a balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities so that the cumulative one year gap is within a range established by the board of directors and which we believe is conducive to maintaining profitability without incurring undue risk 
during  we increased our investment in adjustable rate and shorter average life loans and as noted above  our matched three month gap position will help reduce the negative impact of the anticipated further increases in short term interest rates in the first half of the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   that are expected to reprice  based upon certain assumptions and contractual maturities  in each of the future periods shown 
adjustable rate mortgage backed securities are scheduled according to their next adjustment date and fixed rate mortgage backed securities are scheduled according to their maturity date in thousands three months or less more than three months to six months more than six months to months more than one year to years more than three years to years more than five years to years more than ten years total rate sensitive assets residential lending commercial and consumer lending mortgage backed securities debt securities corporate equity securities fhlb stock interest earning deposits total interest earning assets rate sensitive liabilities deposits demand  money market and savings accounts time deposits fhlb advances other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest earning assets cumulative interest bearing liabilities cumulative interest sensitivity gap as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest earning assets as a percentage of cumulative interest bearing liabilities
