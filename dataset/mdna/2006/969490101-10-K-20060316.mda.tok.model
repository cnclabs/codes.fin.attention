item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to provide information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition  changes in our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an oil and natural gas exploration  development  acquisition  and production company 
our basic business model is to find and develop oil and gas reserves through exploration and development activities  and sell the production from those reserves at a profit 
to be successful  we must  over time  be able to find oil and gas reserves and then sell the resulting production at a price that is sufficient to cover our finding costs  operating expenses  administrative costs and interest expense  plus offer us a return on our capital investment 
from time to time  we may also acquire producing properties if we believe the acquired assets offer us the potential for reserve growth through additional developmental or exploratory drilling activities 
we believe that the economic climate in the domestic oil and gas industry continues to be suitable for our business model 
oil and gas prices have remained strong 
supply and demand fundamentals continue to suggest that energy prices will remain high for the near term  providing us with the economic incentives necessary for us to assume the risks we face in our search for oil and gas reserves 
however  we are also experiencing significant cost increases in almost all areas of our business activities  especially in drilling and production costs 
high demand for oilfield services is resulting in shortage in equipment and trained personnel  resulting in rate increases 
while profit margins still remain favorable  operating metrics per mcfe  such as finding costs  production costs and overhead costs  are rising 
finding quality domestic oil and gas reserves through exploration is a significant challenge and involves a high degree of risk 
we replaced approximately of our production through extensions and discoveries in  most of which were derived from exploration activities 
however  our wolfcamp exploration program in west texas failed to find sufficient reserves to cover our carrying costs  resulting in an million impairment in our ability to grow our reserves is highly dependent on our overall exploration successes 
we will also continue to look for opportunities to complement our exploration program through the purchase of proved reserves 
key factors to consider the following summarizes the key factors considered by management in the review of our financial condition and operating performance for and the outlook for in july  we significantly improved our liquidity by issuing million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes due we repaid all amounts outstanding at that time under our secured bank credit facilities with net proceeds from the senior notes of approximately million  and had approximately million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility at december  we recorded a million loss on derivatives during cash settlements to counterparties accounted for million of this loss  and changes in mark to market valuations accounted for million 
since we do not presently designate our derivatives as cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards  we recognize the full effect of changing prices on mark to market valuations as a current charge or credit to our results of operations 
exploration costs related to abandonments and impairments totaled million for  most of which was in the cotton valley reef complex  south texas  louisiana and west texas 
our proved oil and gas reserves at december  was bcfe compared to bcfe at december  we added bcfe through extensions and discoveries  purchased bcfe of reserves and added bcfe from net revisions 
we currently plan to spend million in on exploration and development activities  of which approximately relates to exploratory prospects 
we cannot predict our drilling success on exploratory prospects  and our future results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by unsuccessful exploratory drilling results 
in october  we entered into a letter agreement with a contract drilling company which calls for the formation of a joint venture to acquire new drilling rigs 
we will own a interest in the joint venture  which is expected to be formed in march recent exploration and developmental activities south louisiana more than half of the wells in our south louisiana exploration program that were commenced in were productive and resulted in the addition of approximately bcfe of proved reserves in however  the ll e andrea and the state lease natalie were unsuccessful and resulted in aggregate abandonment charges of million in we currently plan to spend million in south louisiana in to generate and lease new exploratory prospects and to drill wells on existing exploratory prospects 
we have begun a six well program on our floyd prospect in plaquemines parish targeting multi pay objectives ranging in depths from  to  feet 
the state lease qq was drilled to a total depth of  feet and is currently being completed 
the state lease qq has been drilled to a total depth of  feet and is pending completion 
the state lease qq has been drilled to a total depth of  feet  and is also pending completion 
the state lease qq is currently drilling 
under the terms of a farmout agreement  we bear of the costs on these wells before casing point to earn a working interest in the drilled acreage 
north louisiana we have begun an exploration program in north louisiana targeting the cotton valley hosston and bossier formations 
in this area  the cotton valley hosston formations are encountered at depths ranging from  to  feet  and the bossier formation is encountered at depths ranging from  to  feet 
we believe that these tight sandstone formations have become more economically viable due to higher product prices  coupled with enhanced drilling and completion techniques 
we have accumulated more than  net acres in this area  and to date have participated in six non operated wells on a small portion of this acreage  four of which are currently being completed and two are in progress 
we are currently drilling the harris  a  foot well in jackson parish targeting the bossier formation  in which we own a working interest 
we plan to spend approximately million in north louisiana in  consisting of million to acquire leases and conduct seismic and exploration activities  and million on drilling 
east texas bossier we have also begun acquiring leases in east texas targeting the bossier formation which is encountered at depths ranging from  to  feet in this area 
to date  we have acquired approximately  net acres and are actively seeking to add to our acreage position 
we plan to spend approximately million for acreage in east texas in and expect to begin drilling on this acreage in permian basin in  we initiated an exploration program in west texas seeking to extend the limits of the wolfcamp formation that is encountered throughout a large segment of this region 
we acquired more than  net acres and have drilled wells across a wide portion of this acreage 
while all of the wells were completed as producers  the oil and gas reserves derived from this drilling program were inadequate to recover our capitalized costs 
as a result  we recorded an million charge for impairment of proved properties and a million charge for impairment of unproved properties in related to our wolfcamp program 
we also drilled the leoncita  a  foot exploratory well in pecos county  texas targeting the barnett shale 
this well was unsuccessful and resulted in a million charge to exploration costs in in addition  we drilled gross net wells in the permian basin and conducted remedial operations on existing wells in while some of the drilling activities in did not result in the quantities of oil and gas reserves that we had expected  the permian basin continues to be a significant source of production and cash flow for us 
we currently plan to spend million on drilling activities in the permian basin in montana utah in  we initiated an exploration program in sheridan county  montana targeting the bakken shale which is encountered at depths ranging from  to  feet in this area 
we are currently drilling the ruegsegger h  a horizontal well at a vertical depth of  feet and a  foot lateral 
we are participating in a joint exploration program with industry partners in the overthrust play in central utah in which we own a interest 
in  we plan to spend approximately million to participate in the drilling of a  foot exploratory well to test this acreage 
other we currently plan to spend million in to explore for oil and gas in other areas  including the austin chalk trend  colorado and alabama 
proved oil and gas reserves the following table summarizes changes in our proved reserves during on a bcfe basis 
bcfe total proved reserves  december  purchases of reserves in place extensions and discoveries revisions of previous estimates sales of reserves in place production total proved reserves  december  during  we replaced of the bcfe that we produced in  computed by dividing the sum of all reserve additions purchases of reserves in place  extensions and discoveries  and revisions of previous estimates  by production 
we use this reserve replacement ratio as a benchmark for determining the sources through which we have expanded or contracted our base of proved reserves 
following is a discussion of the important factors related to each source of reserve additions during purchases of reserves in place 
we purchased bcfe of reserves in relating to properties in west texas 
although we are continually looking for acquisitions  we cannot predict the likelihood of adding any reserves in through purchases of reserves in place 
extensions and discoveries 
our extensions and discoveries during consist of proved reserves attributable directly to the drilling of discovery wells primarily in south louisiana and the permian basin 
of the bcfe of additions  bcfe are proved undeveloped reserves that will require the expenditure of approximately million before the reserves can ultimately be converted to cash flow 
due to the nature of exploratory drilling  we cannot predict the extent to which we will add any reserves in through extensions and discoveries 
revisions of previous estimates 
we added bcfe of proved reserves through revisions of previous estimates 
upward revisions of bcfe were attributable to the effects of higher product prices on the estimated quantities of proved reserves which were offset by downward revisions of approximately bcfe attributable to well performance  primarily from properties in west texas 
as we discuss under application of critical accounting policies and estimates elsewhere in this item  reserve estimates are inherently imprecise 
proved undeveloped reserves are generally the least accurate due to limitations on available information 
this increases the risk that the reserve additions in that are classified as proved undeveloped reserves could be subject to downward revisions in the future as economic conditions change and as more information is obtained through drilling

operating results the following discussion compares our results for the year ended december  to the two previous years 
all references to  and within this section refer to the respective annual periods 
oil and gas operating results our oil and gas sales reached a record high again in  exceeding the previous record in both oil and gas prices continued to exceed previous year levels 
comparing to  oil and gas sales increased million  of which price variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for a million decrease 
comparing to  oil and gas sales increased million  of which price variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for a million decrease 
production in on a mcfe basis was lower than and lower than we increased our oil production in due primarily to additional well production from our swr acquisition in may  offset by lost production as a result of hurricane katrina 
our gas production decreased in from due primarily to lost gas production from hurricane katrina and to higher than expected production declines in the cotton valley reef complex area due to formation performance 
in  our realized gas price was higher than and higher than  while our realized oil price was higher than and higher than historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
we have very little control over the prices we receive for our production at the wellhead since most of our physical marketing arrangements are market sensitive 
we cannot predict with accuracy future prices for oil and gas although currently we believe the fundamentals are in place for a continued strong oil and gas commodities market 
however  we have not designated our current commodity derivatives  and do not currently intend to designate future commodity derivatives  as cash flow hedges under sfas this means that  in future periods as oil and gas prices fluctuate  our derivatives will be marked to market through our statement of operations as other income loss instead of through accumulated other comprehensive income on our balance sheet 
additionally  all realized gains or losses on these derivatives in future periods will be reported in other income loss instead of oil and gas sales 
this accounting treatment affects the timing and classification of income loss from derivatives  but it has no effect on cash flow from operating activities 
since we cannot predict future oil and gas prices  we cannot predict the effect that this accounting treatment will have on oil and gas sales or other income loss in future periods 
oil and gas production costs on an mcfe basis in were higher than and higher than the increase in operating costs in and was due in part to higher oilfield service costs and an increase in workover activities 
also contributing to the added expense was the addition of higher cost oil properties acquired in connection with the swr merger  as well as increased production tax costs related to higher product prices 
it is likely that these factors will continue to contribute to higher production costs in future periods 
depletion on an mcfe basis increased from and from comparing to  depletion expense increased million  of which rate variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for a  decrease 
comparing to  depletion expense increased million  of which rate variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for a million decrease 
depletion rates for each depletable group are a function of net capitalized costs and estimated reserve quantities 
the rates for are expected to be similar to the rates 
general and administrative g a expenses  excluding non cash stock based employee compensation  were higher than and higher than due primarily to higher personnel costs  professional fees and insurance costs 
g a expenses for include a non cash charge of million for stock based employee compensation required by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
a non cash credit reduction of expense of  was required for the period and a charge of  was needed for in addition  we recognized  of non cash compensation expense for the estimated value of after payout working interests conveyed to incentive partnerships formed in exploration costs in  we charged to expense million of exploration costs  as compared to million in and million in since we follow the successful efforts method of accounting  our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved acreage impairments are expensed 
most of these costs were incurred in south louisiana and mississippi 
we plan to spend approximately million on exploration and development activities in since exploratory drilling involves a high degree of risk  it is likely that a significant portion of this will be charged to exploration costs in however  we cannot predict our success rates and  accordingly  cannot predict our exploration costs related to abandonment and impairment costs 
gains and losses on property sales gain on sale of property and equipment for was million 
in august  we sold our interests in two leases in the breton sound area in the gulf of mexico offshore louisiana for million  subject to post closing adjustments and realized a gain of million on this sale 
in fiscal we recorded a gain of million  including the sale of the jo mill unit in borden county  texas 
loss on sale of property and equipment for was million including the sale of the romere pass unit in plaquemines parish  louisiana 
under eitf  applying the conditions in paragraph of fasb statement no 
in determining whether to report discontinued operations  we determined that these sales do not qualify for discontinued operations reporting 
we adopted eitf during the fourth quarter of interest expense interest expense was million in as compared to million in and million in included in was a non cash charge of million of debt issue costs related to the early repayment of our senior term credit facility 
in july  we repaid all outstanding balances on our bank indebtedness using proceeds from the issuance of million of senior notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of 
higher effective interest rates on our revolving credit facility and our senior term credit facility also contributed to the increase in interest expense 
loss on derivatives we recorded a loss on derivatives of million in compared to a loss of million in and a loss of million in we did not designate any derivative contracts in or as cash flow hedges  therefore all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark to market valuations have been recorded as losses on derivatives 
cash settlements were million in  as compared to million in  and non cash mark to market losses were million in  as compared to million in other at december   our cumulative tax loss carryforwards were approximately million 
based upon current commodity prices and production volumes  as well as the availability of tax planning strategies such as elective capitalization of intangible drilling costs  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize these tax loss carryforwards before they expire beginning in 
accordingly  no valuation allowance exists at december  a valuation allowance at december  was reversed during liquidity and capital resources overview our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
we pledge our producing oil and gas properties to a group of banks to secure our revolving credit facility and  until july  our senior term credit facility 
the banks establish a borrowing base by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties 
we borrow funds on the revolving credit facility as needed to supplement our operating cash flow as a financing source for our capital expenditure program 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves 
if product prices decrease  our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base  thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program 
the effects of product prices on cash flow can be mitigated through the use of commodity derivatives 
if we are unable to replace our oil and gas reserves through our exploration program  we may also suffer a reduction in our operating cash flow and access to funds under the revolving credit facility 
under extreme circumstances  product price reductions or exploration drilling failures could allow the banks to seek to foreclose on our oil and gas properties  thereby threatening our financial viability 
in july  we reduced our dependence on the borrowing base established for the revolving credit facility by issuing million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the senior notes and using the net proceeds to repay all amounts outstanding on the revolving credit facility and the senior term credit facility 
in this section  we will describe our current plans for capital spending  identify the capital resources available to finance our capital spending  and discuss the principal factors that can affect our liquidity and capital resources 
capital expenditures exploration and development our planned expenditures for exploration and development activities during total million  as summarized by area in the following table 
total planned expenditures year ended december  percentage of total in thousands north louisiana south lousiana east texas bossier permian basin utah montana austin chalk trend other our actual expenditures during fiscal may be substantially higher or lower than these estimates since our plans for exploration and development activities may change during the year 
other factors  such as prevailing product prices and the availability of capital resources  could also increase or decrease the ultimate level of expenditures during fiscal approximately of our planned expenditures for relate to exploratory prospects  including million of completion costs on exploratory wells to be drilled in north louisiana and south louisiana that are classified as exploratory wells but are considered likely to require the expenditure of completion costs 
exploratory prospects involve a higher degree of risk than developmental prospects 
to offset this higher risk  we generally strive to achieve a higher reserve potential and rate of return on investments in exploratory prospects 
we do not attempt to forecast our success rate on exploratory drilling 
accordingly  these current estimates may not include all costs that may be required to complete our successful exploratory wells and construct the required production facilities for these wells 
also  we are actively searching for other opportunities to increase our oil and gas reserves  including the evaluation of new prospects for exploratory and developmental drilling activities and potential acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties 
other factors  such as prevailing product prices and the availability of capital resources  could also increase or decrease the ultimate level of expenditures during we project that most of the cash needed to finance our planned expenditures for exploration and development activities in fiscal will be provided by operating activities 
to the extent that actual costs exceed our cash provided by operating activities  we plan to utilize the revolving credit facility to finance such excess 
drilling rig joint venture in october  we entered into a letter agreement with lariat services  inc lariat  a contract drilling company  which calls for the formation of a joint venture to acquire at least new drilling rigs 
we and lariat will each own a interest in the joint venture 
lariat will serve as the operations manager of the joint venture  and we will be responsible for financing the purchase of the rigs 
the total acquisition cost  including construction and equipping of the rigs  is expected to be approximately million 
the joint venture has received a proposal from a lender to provide financing for up to million  depending on the appraised values of the drilling rigs upon completion of construction 
during  while the drilling rigs are being constructed  the proposal contemplates that we provide the lender a million standby letter of credit as additional credit support 
on or before december   we would terminate the letter of credit and provide an unconditional guaranty to the lender of the repayment and performance by the joint venture limited to million of the outstanding balance of the loan facility 
under the terms of the proposal  we would also be required to contract with the joint venture to use the drilling rigs in our drilling program for a term of at least three years and to pay for idle  non working rigs in amounts ranging from  to  per day 
we expect to complete negotiations with the lender and to close the financing in march at december   we had made advances on behalf of the joint venture of approximately million for interim construction costs of the rigs and related equipment 
the joint venture is to reimburse us for all advances once it has received the proceeds from the financing 
we are currently evaluating our investment in this joint venture to determine if we are the primary beneficiary under fin r 
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary  we will be required to fully consolidate this entity in equipment orders as of december   we had placed firm orders for tubing  casing  pumping units and other equipment to be used in its exploration and development activities totaling approximately million 
cash flow provided by operating activities substantially all of our cash flow from operating activities is derived from the production of our oil and gas reserves 
we use this cash flow to fund our on going exploration and development activities in search of new oil and gas reserves 
variations in cash flow from operating activities may impact our level of exploration and development expenditures 
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was higher than due to the combined effects of several drivers 
the positive benefits of a increase in oil and gas sales  driven primarily by higher oil and gas prices  were offset in part by increases in production costs and interest expense 
our primary source of cash from operating activities is our oil and gas sales  net of production costs 
our cash flow provided by operating activities is subject to material variation from changes in oil and gas production levels and product prices 
interest expense increased in due primarily to higher levels of indebtedness 
credit facility a group of banks have provided us with a revolving credit facility on which we have historically relied for both our short term liquidity working capital and our long term financing needs 
the funds available to us at any time under this revolving credit facility are limited to the amount of the borrowing base established by the banks 
as long as we have sufficient availability under this credit facility to meet our obligations as they come due  we will have sufficient liquidity and will be able to fund any short term working capital deficit 
at the beginning of  we had an outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility of million  and the borrowing base was million  providing us with available funds of million after accounting for outstanding letters of credit 
during the year ended december   we generated cash flow from operating activities of million and received proceeds from sales of property and equipment of million 
we also spent million on capital expenditures and other investments and paid million to settle derivatives with financing elements 
with the issuance of the senior notes in july  we borrowed million  net of financing costs  repaid the balance on the revolving credit facility and repaid the remaining million balance on the senior term credit facility 
simultaneously  the borrowing base was reduced from million to million to give effect to the issuance of the senior notes 
in december the borrowing base was increased to million 
the available funds under our revolving credit facility were million at december   and our available cash at december  decreased by million from december  using the revolving credit facility for both our short term liquidity and long term financing needs can cause unusual fluctuations in our reported working capital  depending on the timing of cash receipts and expenditures 
on a daily basis  we use most of our available cash to pay down our outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility  which is classified as a non current liability since we currently have no required principal reductions 
as we use cash to pay a non current liability  our reported working capital decreases 
conversely  as we draw on the revolving credit facility for funds to pay current liabilities such as payables for drilling and operating costs  our reported working capital increases 
also  volatility in oil and gas prices can cause significant fluctuations in reported working capital as we record changes in the fair value of derivatives from period to period 
for these reasons  the working capital covenant related to the revolving credit facility requires us to i include the amount of funds available under this facility as a current asset  ii exclude current assets and liabilities related to the fair value of derivatives  and iii exclude current maturities of vendor finance obligations  if any  when computing the working capital ratio at any balance sheet date 
working capital computed for loan compliance purposes differs from our working capital in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
since compliance with financial covenants is a material requirement under the credit facilities  we consider the loan compliance working capital to be useful as a measure of our liquidity because it includes the funds available to us under the revolving credit facility and is not affected by the volatility in working capital caused by changes in fair value of derivatives 
our reported working capital deficit increased from million at december  to million at december  due primarily to a combination of factors  including decreases in accounts payable  increases in inventory and increases in current liabilities related to the fair value of derivatives 
after giving effect to the adjustments  our working capital computed for loan compliance purposes was a positive million at december   as compared to a positive million at december  the following table reconciles our gaap working capital to the working capital computed for loan compliance purposes at december  and december  december  december  in thousands working capital deficit per gaap add funds available under the revolving credit facility exclude fair value of derivatives classified as current assets or current liabilities working capital per loan covenant since we use this revolving credit facility for both short term liquidity and long term financing needs  it is important that we comply in all material respects with the loan agreement  including financial covenants that are computed quarterly 
the working capital covenant requires us to maintain positive working capital using the computations described above 
another financial covenant under the credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of indebtedness to cash flow of no more than to while we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants at december   our increased leverage and reduced liquidity may result in our failing to comply with one or more of these covenants in the future 
if we fail to meet any of these loan covenants  we would ask the banks to allow us sufficient time to obtain additional capital resources through alternative means 
if a suitable arrangement could not be reached with the banks  the banks could accelerate the indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the pledged assets 
however  the issuance of the senior notes described below significantly increases our liquidity and reduces our dependence on the revolving credit facility 
the banks redetermine the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility at least twice a year  in may and november 
if at any time  the borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding indebtedness  we will be required to i pledge additional collateral  ii prepay the excess in not more than five equal monthly installments  or iii elect to convert the entire amount of outstanding indebtedness to a term obligation based on amortization formulas set forth in the loan agreement 
senior notes due in july  we issued  in a private placement  million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
the senior notes were issued at face value and will bear interest at per year  payable semi annually on february and august of each year  beginning february  after the payment of typical transaction expenses  net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay amounts outstanding on our secured credit facilities and for general corporate purposes  including the funding of planned exploration and development activities 
at any time prior to august   we may redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  prior to august   we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed  plus a make whole premium  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
on and after august   we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at redemption prices expressed as percentages of principal amount equal to for the twelve month period beginning on august   for the twelve month period beginning on august   and beginning on august   for any period thereafter  in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the indenture governing the senior notes restricts our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to i borrow money  ii issue redeemable and preferred stock  iii pay distributions or dividends  iv make investments  v create liens without securing the notes  vi enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries  vii sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies  viii enter into transactions with affiliates  ix guarantee indebtedness  and x enter into new lines of business 
these covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications 
since the senior notes have an eight year maturity and bear interest at a fixed rate of  we expect our effective annual interest rate to increase in future periods 
alternative capital resources although our base of oil and gas reserves  as collateral for the revolving credit facility  has historically been our primary capital resource  we have in the past  and we believe we could in the future  use alternative capital resources  such as asset sales  vendor financing arrangements  and or public or private issuances of common stock 
we could also issue subordinated debt or preferred stock in a public or a private placement if we choose to raise capital through either of these markets 
while we believe we would be able to obtain funds through one or more of these alternatives  if needed  there can be no assurance that these capital resources would be available on terms acceptable to us 
contractual obligations and contingent commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  by payment due date 
payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands contractual obligations senior notes a secured bank credit facility a drilling contracts purchase commitments abandonment obligations lease obligations other total contractual obligations a in addition to the principal payments presented  we expect to make annual interest payments of million on the senior notes and approximately  on the secured bank credit facility based on the balances and rates at december  
excluded from the table above is our mark to market liability related to commodity and interest rate derivatives 
our derivative obligations  based on mark to market valuations at december   would mature as follows million  million  and million 
known trends and uncertainties oil and gas production as with all companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production  we face the challenge of natural production decline since oil and gas reserves are a depletable resource 
with each unit of oil and gas we produce  we are depleting our proved reserve base  so we must be able to conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties with proved reserves in order to grow our reserve base 
our production has been on a gradual decline since due to the effects of natural production decline  offset in part by reserve additions through exploration and development and acquisitions 
at the present time  we continue to have approximately  mcfe of production shut in due to hurricane damage to facilities suffered in that we expect to return to production in we also expect to add production from our exploration and development activities in north and south louisiana 
while we cannot predict the results of our exploration and development activities  we believe that oil and gas production levels in will be comparable to those in equipment and personnel shortages commodity prices for natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil have been on an upward trend since higher prices have led to increased activity in the industry  which in turn has resulted in significant cost increases in almost all areas of our business activities  especially in drilling and production costs 
drilling rig counts are at historically high levels and qualified rig crews are in short supply 
equipment and labor shortages were further strained by hurricane damage in the gulf of mexico in august and september drilling rigs have recently been in short supply throughout the industry  and we do not foresee an end to this shortage in the near future 
in order to secure rig availability for our exploration and development drilling  we have entered into a joint venture to acquire drilling rigs see liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures drilling rig joint venture and have entered into an month contract with another drilling contractor for one rig to be utilized in north louisiana 
raw material shortages and strong global demand for steel have continued to tighten steel supplies and have caused supplies of casing  tubing and other surface and subsurface equipment to decrease and costs to increase 
during  we increased our equipment inventory by million in an effort to secure the levels of inventory we need to conduct our drilling programs 
we cannot accurately predict the duration and extent of these equipment and personnel shortages  however  any significant escalation in shortages can have an adverse affect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates summary in this section  we will identify the critical accounting policies we follow in preparing our financial statements and disclosures 
many of these policies require us to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments in the course of making estimates of matters that are inherently imprecise 
we explain the nature of these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following table lists our critical accounting policies  the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the application of these accounting policies  and the financial statement accounts affected by these estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies estimates or assumptions accounts affected successful efforts accounting for oil and gas properties reserve estimates valuation of unproved properties judgment regarding status of inprogress exploratory wells oil and gas properties accumulated dd a provision for dd a impairment of unproved properties abandonment costs dry hole costs impairment of proved properties reserve estimates and related present value of future net revenues oil and gas properties accumulated dd a impairment of proved properties valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets estimates related to utilizing net operating loss nol carryforwards deferred tax assets deferred tax liabilities deferred income taxes asset retirement obligations estimates of the present value of future abandonment costs abandonment obligations non current liability oil and gas properties accretion of discount expense dd a means depreciation  depletion and amortization 
significant estimates and assumptions oil and gas reserves reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate depends on the quality of available geological and engineering data  the precision of the interpretation of that data  and judgment based on experience and training 
annually  we engage independent petroleum engineering firms to evaluate our oil and gas reserves 
as a part of this process  our internal reservoir engineer and the independent engineers exchange information and attempt to reconcile any material differences in estimates and assumptions 
while we believe this reconciliation process improves the accuracy of the reserve estimates by reducing the likelihood of a material error in judgment  it is possible that in exchanging information  our internal reservoir engineer could influence the independent engineer s estimates and assumptions 
the techniques used in estimating reserves usually depend on the nature and extent of available data  and the accuracy of the estimates vary accordingly 
as a general rule  the degree of accuracy of reserve estimates varies with the reserve classification and the related accumulation of available data  as shown in the following table 
type of reserves nature of available data degree of accuracy proved undeveloped data from offsetting wells  seismic data least accurate proved developed nonproducing logs  core samples  well tests  pressure data more accurate proved developed producing production history  pressure data over time most accurate assumptions as to future commodity prices and operating and capital costs also play a significant role in estimating oil and gas reserves and the estimated present value of the cash flows to be received from the future production of those reserves 
volumes of recoverable reserves are affected by the assumed prices and costs due to what is known as the economic limit that point in the future when the projected costs and expenses of producing recoverable reserves exceed the projected revenues from the reserves 
but more significantly  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is extremely sensitive to prices and costs  and may vary materially based on different assumptions 
sec financial accounting and reporting standards require that pricing parameters be tied to the price received for oil and natural gas on the effective date of the reserve report 
this requirement can result in significant changes from period to period given the volatile nature of oil and gas product prices  as illustrated in the following table 
proved reserves average price standardized measure of discounted oil a mmbbls gas bcf oil a bbl gas mcf future net cash flows in millions as of december a includes natural gas liquids valuation of unproved properties placing a fair market value on unproved properties also known as prospects is very subjective since there is no quoted market for undeveloped exploratory prospects 
the negotiated price of any prospect between a willing seller and willing buyer depends on the specific facts regarding the prospect  including the location of the prospect in relation to known fields and reservoirs  available markets and transportation systems for oil and gas production in the vicinity  and other critical services  the nature and extent of geological and geophysical data on the prospect  the terms of the leases holding the acreage in the prospect  such as ownership interests  expiration terms  delay rental obligations  depth limitations  drilling and marketing restrictions  and similar terms  the prospect s risk adjusted potential for return on investment  giving effect to such factors as potential reserves to be discovered  drilling and completion costs  prevailing commodity prices  and other economic factors  and the results of drilling activity in close proximity to the prospect that could either enhance or condemn the prospect s chances of success 
asset retirement obligations we are required by sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations to estimate the present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we compute our liability for asset retirement obligations by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows related to each property 
this requires us to use significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligations 
valuation allowance for nol carryforwards in computing our provision for income taxes  we must assess the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of net operating loss nol carryforwards 
for federal income tax purposes  these nol carryforwards  if unused  expire to years from the year of origination 
generally  we assess our ability to fully utilize these carryforwards by comparing expected future book income to expected future taxable income based on the assumption that we will produce our existing reserves  as scheduled for production in our reserve report  under current economic conditions 
if future book income does not exceed future taxable income by amounts sufficient to utilize nols before they expire  we must impair the resulting deferred tax asset 
these computations are inherently imprecise due to the extensive use of estimates and assumptions 
as a result  we may make additional impairments to allow for such uncertainties 
effects of estimates and assumptions on financial statements generally accepted accounting principles do not require  or even permit  the restatement of previously issued financial statements due to changes in estimates unless such estimates were unreasonable or did not comply with applicable sec accounting rules 
we are required to use our best judgment in making estimates and assumptions  taking into consideration the best and most current data available to us at the time of the estimate 
at each accounting period  we make a new estimate using new data  and continue the cycle 
you should be aware that estimates prepared at various times may be substantially different due to new or additional information 
while an estimate made at one point in time may differ from an estimate made at a later date  both may be proper due to the differences in available information or assumptions 
in this section  we will discuss the effects of different estimates on our financial statements 
provision for dd a we compute our provision for dd a on a unit of production method 
each quarter  we use the following formulas to compute the provision for dd a for each of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities dd a rate unamortized cost beginning of period reserves provision for dd a dd a rate current period production reserve estimates have a significant impact on the dd a rate 
if reserve estimates for a property or group of properties are revised downward in future periods  the dd a rate for that property or group of properties will increase as a result of the revision 
alternatively  if reserve estimates are revised upward  the dd a rate will decrease 
impairment of unproved properties each quarter  we review our unproved oil and gas properties to determine if there has been  in our judgment  an impairment in value of each prospect that we consider individually significant 
to the extent that the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of unproved properties  and record the provision as abandonments and impairments within exploration costs on our statement of operations 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the prospect at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
impairment of proved properties each quarter  we assess our producing properties for impairment 
if we determine there has been an impairment in any of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities  we will estimate the value of each affected property 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  the value for this purpose is a fair value instead of a standardized reserve value as prescribed by the sec 
we attempt to value each property using reserve classifications and pricing parameters similar to what a willing seller and willing buyer might use 
these parameters may include escalations of prices instead of constant pricing  and they may also include the risk adjusted value of reserves that do not qualify as proved reserves 
to the extent that the carrying cost for the affected property exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of proved properties 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the property at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
accordingly  the carrying costs of producing properties on our balance sheet will vary from and often will be less than the present value of proved reserves for these properties 
judgment regarding status of in progress wells on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each in progress well to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting 
cumulative costs on in progress wells remain capitalized until their productive status becomes known 
if an in progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful often referred to as a dry hole prior to the issuance of our financial statements  we write off all costs incurred through the balance sheet date to abandonments and impairments expense  a component of exploration costs 
costs incurred on that dry hole after the balance sheet date are charged to exploration costs in the period incurred 
occasionally  we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of our financial statements 
in these cases  we leave the well classified as in progress until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations and to evaluate the pertinent g g and engineering data obtained 
at the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well s productive status  the well is removed from the in progress status and the proper accounting treatment is recorded 
valuation allowance for nol carryforwards each quarter  we assess our ability to utilize nol carryforwards 
an increase in the valuation allowance from one period to the next will result in a decrease in our net deferred tax assets and a decrease in earnings 
similarly  a decrease in the valuation allowance will result in an increase in our net deferred tax assets and an increase in earnings 
this process requires estimates and assumptions which are complex and may vary materially from our actual ability to utilize nol carryforwards in the future 
also  the current tax laws in this area are complicated due to the impact of alternative minimum tax on the utilization of nol carryforwards 
as a mitigating factor  as long as we are actively drilling for new production  we have some tax planning strategies available to us  such as elective capitalization of intangible drilling costs  to help us utilize these nol carryforwards before they expire 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to oil and gas properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the statement of operations 
during  we increased our estimated asset retirement obligations by million  or approximately of the asset retirement obligations at december   based on a review of current plugging and abandonment costs 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on issue  subject to ratification by the financial accounting standards board fasb  regarding when a limited partnership should be consolidated by its general partner 
the proposed framework presumes that a sole general partner in a limited partnership controls the limited partnership 
the presumption of control can be overcome if the limited partners have i the substantive ability to remove the sole general partner or otherwise dissolve the limited partnership or ii substantive participating rights 
the eitf has concluded that a general partner lacks control if the limited partners can remove the general partner with a simple majority vote 
we are the general partner of several oil and gas limited partnerships and proportionately consolidate interest in these partnerships 
we are currently reviewing the applicable provisions of the partnership agreements to determine the impact that eitf may have on our consolidated financial statements 
for existing partnerships  eitf will be effective for our consolidated financial statements issued after january  eitf is effective for newly created or modified limited partnerships subsequent to june  if we determine that the limited partners do not have the substantive ability to remove the general partner in accordance with eitf issue  we will be required to fully consolidate the limited partnerships  with the interest we do not own reflected as minority interest 
this would have no impact to our future net income from the current method of accounting for oil and gas limited partnerships using proportionate consolidation 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payments sfas r 
sfas r requires that the cost from all share based payment transactions  including stock options  be recognized in the financial statements at fair value 
we currently use the intrinsic value method to account for these share based payments 
for public companies  sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt the provisions of this statement in the first quarter of we have accounted for options which were repriced in as variable stock options whereby compensation expense has been recognized through december  for unexercised options 
in accordance with sfas r  we will cease accounting for these options as variable stock options upon the adoption date 
since all of our outstanding options are fully vested at december   no future compensation expense will be recognized under sfas r unless the options are modified 
accordingly  future compensation expense to be recognized under sfas r will be determined by the grant date fair value of future awards 
in april  the fasb issued staff position no 
fsp 
fsp amends the present guidance in sfas  paragraphs and  regarding when exploratory drilling costs pending determination of proved reserves can be carried as an asset of an oil and gas company that uses the successful efforts accounting method 
we were required to adopt fsp  including its disclosures  effective july  the adoption of fsp did not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
at december  and december   we had capitalized million and million  respectively  of exploratory drilling costs applicable to wells that were pending determination of proved reserves 
substantially all of the december  capitalized costs were subsequently classified as non productive 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s our business is impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion is intended to identify the nature of these market risks  describe our strategy for managing such risks  and to quantify the potential affect of market volatility on our financial condition and results of operations 
oil and gas prices our financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions  both foreign and domestic 
we cannot predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a drop in the price per bbl of oil and a 
drop in the price per mcf of gas would reduce our gross revenues for the year ending december  by million 
from time to time  we utilize commodity derivatives  consisting primarily of swaps  floors and collars to attempt to optimize the price received for our oil and natural gas production 
when using swaps to hedge our oil and natural gas production  we receive a fixed price for the respective commodity and pay a floating market price as defined in each contract generally nymex futures prices  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
when purchasing floors  we receive a fixed price put strike price if the market price falls below the put strike price for the respective commodity 
if the market price is greater than the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
costless collars are a combination of puts and calls  and contain a fixed floor price put strike price and ceiling price call strike price 
if the market price for the respective commodity exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  then we receive the fixed price and pay the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike prices  no payments are due from either party 
the commodity derivatives we use differ from futures contracts in that there is not a contractual obligation that requires or permits the future physical delivery of the hedged products 
we do not enter into commodity derivatives for trading purposes 
in addition to commodity derivatives  we may  from time to time  sell a portion of our gas production under short term contracts at fixed prices 
the decision to initiate or terminate commodity hedges is made by management based on its expectation of future market price movements 
we have no set goals for the percentage of our production we hedge and we do not use any formulas or triggers in deciding when to initiate or terminate a hedge 
if we enter into swaps or collars and the floating market price at the settlement date is higher than the fixed price or the fixed ceiling price  we will forego revenue we would have otherwise received 
if we terminate a swap  collar or floor because we anticipate future increases in market prices  we may be exposed to downside risk that would not have existed otherwise 
the following summarizes information concerning the company s net positions in open commodity derivatives applicable to periods subsequent to december  the settlement prices of commodity derivatives are based on nymex futures prices 
collars gas oil mmbtu a floor ceiling bbls floor ceiling production period st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter a one mmbtu equals one mcf at a btu factor of  we use a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of oil and gas may have on the fair value of our commodity derivatives 
a per barrel change in the price of oil and a 
per mmbtu change in the price of gas would change the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivatives at december  by approximately million 
interest rates all of our outstanding bank indebtedness at december  is subject to market rates of interest as determined from time to time by the banks pursuant to our credit facilities 
we may designate borrowings under our revolving credit facility as either base rate loans or eurodollar loans 
base rate loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to the discount rates established by the federal reserve board 
eurodollar loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to libor 
any increases in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
we are a party to interest rate swaps that were acquired in connection with the swr acquisition 
under these derivatives  we pay a fixed rate for the notional principal balances and receive a floating market rate based on libor 
the following summarizes information concerning our net positions in open interest rate swaps applicable to periods subsequent to december  interest rate swaps principal balance fixed libor rates period january  to november  november  to november  november  to november
