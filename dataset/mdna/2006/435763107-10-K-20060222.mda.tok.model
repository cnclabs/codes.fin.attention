in this document  the words we  our  ours and us refer to hep and its consolidated subsidiaries or to hep or an individual subsidiary and not to any other person 
overview hep is a delaware limited partnership formed by holly and is the successor to npl 
on march   we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec relating to a proposed underwritten initial public offering of limited partnership units in hep 
hep was formed to acquire  own and operate substantially all of the refined product pipeline and terminalling assets that support holly s refining and marketing operations in west texas  new mexico  utah and arizona and a interest in rio grande 
on july   we priced  common units for the initial public offering and on july   our common units began trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbol hep 
on july   we closed our initial public offering of  common units at a price of per unit  which included a  unit over allotment option that was exercised by the underwriters 
total proceeds from the sale of the units were million  net of million of underwriting commissions 
all the initial assets of hep were contributed by holly and its subsidiaries in exchange for a  subordinated units  representing limited partner interest in hep  b incentive distribution rights  c the general partner interest and d an aggregate cash distribution of million 
we operate a system of petroleum product pipelines in texas  new mexico and oklahoma  and distribution terminals in texas  new mexico  arizona  utah  idaho  and washington 
we generate revenues by charging tariffs for transporting petroleum products through our pipelines and by charging fees for terminalling refined products and other hydrocarbons  and storing and providing other services at our terminals 
we do not take ownership of products that we transport or terminal  therefore  we are not directly exposed to changes in commodity prices 
on february   we closed on a contribution agreement with alon that provided for our acquisition of four refined products pipelines  an associated tank farm and two refined products terminals located primarily in texas 
please read alon transaction under liquidity and capital resources below for additional information 
on july   we closed on a purchase agreement to acquire holly s intermediate pipelines which connect its lovington  new mexico and artesia  new mexico refining facilities 
please read holly intermediate pipelines transaction under liquidity and capital resources below for additional information 
as a result of the alon transaction  holly s ownership interest was reduced from to  including the general partner interest 
holly s ownership was further reduced to in july following the intermediate pipelines transaction 
historical results of operations in reviewing the historical results of operations that are discussed below  you should be aware of the following until january   our historical revenues included only actual amounts received from third parties who utilized our pipelines and terminals  holly for use of our ferc regulated refined product pipeline  and holly for use of the lovington crude oil pipelines  which were not contributed to our partnership 

table of contents until january   we did not record revenue for transporting products for holly on our intrastate refined product pipelines  providing terminalling services to holly  and transporting crude oil and feedstocks on the intermediate pipelines that connect holly s artesia and lovington facilities  which were not contributed to our partnership 
commencing january   we began charging holly fees for the use of all of our pipelines and terminals at the rates set forth in the holly pta described below under agreements with holly 
in addition  our historical results of operations reflect the impact of the following acquisitions completed in june the purchase of an additional interest in rio grande on june   bringing our total ownership to  which resulted in our consolidating rio grande effective from the date of this acquisition rather than accounting for it on the equity method  and the purchase of terminals in spokane  washington  and boise and burley  idaho  as well as the woods cross truck rack  all of which are related to holly s woods cross refinery 
furthermore  the historical financial data do not reflect any general and administrative expenses prior to july  as holly did not historically allocate any of its general and administrative expenses to its pipelines and terminals 
our historical results of operations prior to july  include costs associated with crude oil and intermediate product pipelines  which were not contributed to our partnership 
for periods after commencement of operations by hep on july   our financial statements reflect net proceeds from our initial public offering which closed on july  see liquidity and capital resources below  the transfer of certain of our predecessor s operations to hep  which includes our predecessor s refined product pipeline and terminal assets and short term debt due to holly which was repaid upon the closing of our initial public offering  and excludes our predecessor s crude oil systems  intermediate product pipelines  accounts receivable from or payable to affiliates  and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities  the execution of the holly pta and the recognition of revenues derived therefrom  and the execution of the omnibus agreement with holly and several of its subsidiaries and the recognition of allocated general and administrative expenses in addition to direct general and administrative expense related to our operation as a publicly owned entity 
npl constitutes hep s predecessor 
the transfer of ownership of assets from npl to hep represented a reorganization of entities under common control and was recorded at historical cost 
accordingly  our financial statements include the historical results of operations of npl prior to the transfer to hep

following the july  producer price index adjustment  the volume commitments by holly under the holly pta will produce at least million of revenue annually 
prior to july   holly did not allocate any of its general and administrative expenses to its pipeline and terminalling operations 
under the omnibus agreement with holly  we have agreed to pay holly an annual administrative fee  initially in the amount of million  for the provision by holly or its affiliates of various general and administrative services to us for three years following the closing of our initial public offering

the amounts reported represent volumes from the initial assets contributed to hep at inception in july and additional volumes from the assets acquired from alon starting in march and the intermediate pipelines acquired from holly starting in july the amounts reported in the periods include volumes on the acquired assets from their respective acquisition dates averaged over the full reported periods 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  summary net income was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in income was principally due to the inclusion in earnings of million in the prior year period of the crude oil and intermediate product pipelines that were not contributed to the partnership at inception  reduced revenues from the rio grande pipeline  general and administrative charges currently being incurred by the partnership that were not allocated prior to the initial public offering  and interest expense principally related to the senior notes issued in connection with the alon and intermediate pipelines transactions  partially offset by the additional income generated from the assets acquired from alon and the intermediate pipelines subsequently acquired from holly  and additional revenues from our existing pipelines and terminals 
revenues revenues of million for the year ended december  were million greater than the million in the comparable period of  principally due to million of revenues from the pipeline and terminal assets acquired from alon on february  and million of revenues from the intermediate pipeline assets acquired from holly on july   partially offset by revenues of million in the year ended december  from assets not originally contributed to the partnership 
also  we had additional revenues from our existing pipelines and terminals of million and reduced revenues from the rio grande pipeline of million 
revenues from refined product pipelines increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  shipments on the partnership s refined product pipelines averaged thousand barrels per day mbpd for the year ended december  as compared to mbpd for the year ended december   principally due to the incremental march to december volumes from the pipelines acquired from alon  combined with increased volumes shipped by holly and its affiliates  partially offset by reduced volumes shipped on the rio grande pipeline 
revenues from the intermediate product pipelines purchased from holly in july contributed million to revenue in the year ended december  revenues from crude system and intermediate pipeline assets not contributed to hep were million for the year ended december   as a result of including operations of the predecessor only until july   the commencement of operations of hep 
as anticipated  during the first quarter of based on the aggregate volumes shipped by bp on the rio grande pipeline  bp is no longer required to pay the border crossing fee pursuant to its contract 
for the years ended december  and  the border crossing fee was million and million  respectively 
revenues from terminal and truck loading rack service fees increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  refined products terminalled in our facilities for the comparable periods rose to mbpd in the year ended december  from mbpd in the year ended december   due to the incremental march to december volumes from the terminals acquired from alon and volume gains at our existing terminals 
operating costs operating costs increased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  this increase in expense was principally due to million of operating costs relating to the assets acquired from alon  combined with operating costs of million for the intermediate pipelines that were acquired in july  partially offset by operating costs of million for the crude oil and intermediate pipelines that were not contributed to hep in july 
table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million higher in the year ended december  than in the year ended december   due principally to the increase in depreciation from the assets acquired from alon 
general and administrative general and administrative costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of million from million for the year ended december  no general and administrative costs were incurred prior to hep s formation date of july   as holly did not allocate any general and administrative costs to its subsidiaries 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of million from million for the year ended december  the increase is due to the debt issued in connection with the alon and intermediate pipelines acquisitions 
in the year ended december   interest expense consisted of million of interest on the outstanding debt  net of the impact of the interest rate swap  million of commitment fees on the unused portion of the credit agreement  and million of amortization of the discount on the senior notes and deferred debt issuance costs 
as no interest expense was incurred prior to formation on july   only million of interest expense was recorded on the credit agreement and commitment fees for the year ended december  minority interest in earnings of rio grande the minority interest related to the of rio grande that we do not own reduced our income by million in year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  summary net income for the year ended december  was million  a million increase from the million for the year ended december   due mainly to the commencement of recording all affiliate revenues beginning january  as a result  we recorded million of revenue in for which no comparable revenues had been recognized in the period 
we also began consolidating the results of rio grande as of july  due to increasing our ownership to 
this resulted in million more net income in than in the remaining increase in earnings is due to general increased volumes for our pipeline and terminalling services in  the purchase of several new terminals on june  and decreased environmental remediation expenses in revenues revenues of million from the combined operations of the assets contributed to the partnership for the year ended december  were million higher than the million in the comparable period of  primarily as a result of commencement of recording of revenues on intra company transactions effective january  during the year ended december   revenues from assets not contributed to the partnership increased to million from million largely as a result of recording revenues on intermediate product pipelines 
refined product shipments on the partnership s pipeline system averaged mbpd for the year ended december  as compared to mbpd for the year ended december   largely as a result of the expansion of the navajo refinery and the consolidation of rio grande in july  when the ownership interest increased to 

table of contents revenues of million from terminal and truck loading rack service fees for the year ended december  were million higher than the million in revenues from third parties increased by million  largely as a result of the acquisition of the spokane terminal in june  while affiliate revenues  first recognized in  were million 
average volumes of products terminalled in partnership facilities increased to mbpd for the year ended december  from mbpd in in addition to the increase in capacity of the navajo refinery  the average volume was significantly impacted by the acquisition of the woods cross refinery by holly in june  which resulted in the partnership s acquisition of terminals and truck loading facilities in utah  idaho and washington 
operating costs operating costs decreased million from the year ended december  to the year ended december  the expenses for the lovington crude system not contributed to hep decreased million from to due to a million reduction of environmental remediation and maintenance expenses from and a million decrease because expenses are only included until hep s formation on july  the purchase of the spokane  boise and burley terminals and woods cross truck rack in june added million to operating expense for due to only being included in our operations for seven months in increased volumes on our remaining pipelines and terminals added million of operating expense for over  partially offset by exclusion of costs for the intermediate pipelines from july  finally  our operating costs increased by million from to as we started consolidating the results of rio grande in july depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million higher in the year ended december  than in year ended december  of this increase  million is due to the consolidation of rio grande beginning july  there was an offsetting million decrease due to the crude system and intermediate pipelines not being contributed to hep on july  general and administrative general and administrative costs increased million  reflecting costs incurred beginning on hep s formation date of july  prior to that date  holly did not allocate any general and administrative costs to its subsidiaries

we financed the cash portion of the consideration for the intermediate pipelines with the proceeds raised from a the private sale of  of our common units for million to a limited number of institutional investors which closed simultaneously with the 
table of contents acquisition and b an additional million in principal amount of our senior notes due this acquisition was made pursuant to an option to purchase these pipelines granted by holly to us at the time of our initial public offering in july in connection with this transaction  we entered into a year pipelines agreement with holly 
under this agreement  holly agreed to transport volumes of intermediate products on the intermediate pipelines that  at the agreed tariff rates  will result in minimum revenues to us of approximately million per calendar year 
for additional information on this transaction  please see holly intermediate pipelines transaction under item  business 
as this transaction is among entities under common control  we recorded the acquired assets at holly s historic book value of million 
this resulted in payment to holly of a purchase price of million in excess of the basis of the assets received and a million reduction of our net partners equity

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical to understanding the judgments that are involved and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues are recognized as products are shipped through our pipelines and terminals  except that prior to january  pipeline tariff and terminal services fee revenues were not recorded on services utilizing non ferc regulated pipelines 
these revenues had not previously been recognized as the pipelines and terminals were operated as a component of holly s petroleum refining and marketing business 
commencing january   we began charging holly pipeline tariffs and terminal service fees in the amounts set forth in the holly pta 
additional pipeline transportation revenues result from an operating lease by alon usa  lp of an interest in the capacity of one of our pipelines 
billings to customers for obligations under their quarterly minimum revenue commitments are recorded as deferred revenue liabilities if the customer has the right to receive future services for these billings 
the revenue is recognized at the earlier of the customer receives the future services provided by these billings  the period in which the customer is contractually allowed to receive the services expires  or we determine a very high likelihood that we will not be required to provide services within the allowed period 
the only revenues reflected in the historical financial data prior to january  are from a third parties who used our pipelines and terminals  b holly s use of our artesia  new mexico to orla  texas to el paso refined product pipeline and c holly s use of the lovington crude oil pipelines  which were not contributed to us 
long lived assets we calculate depreciation and amortization based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
when assets are placed into service  we make estimates with respect to their useful lives that we believe are reasonable 
however  factors such as competition  regulation or environmental matters could cause us to change our estimates  thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization 
we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment by identifying whether indicators of impairment exist and  if so  assessing whether the long lived assets are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
the actual amount of impairment loss  if any  to be recorded is equal to the amount by which a long lived asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value 
estimates of future discounted cash flows and fair value of assets require subjective assumptions with regard to future operating results  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
no impairments of long lived assets were recorded during the years ended december  and contingencies it is common in our industry to be subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these types of matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these types of contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these potential matters 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas revised  share based payment 
this revision prescribes the accounting for a wide range of equity based compensation arrangements  including share options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans  and generally requires the fair value of equity based awards to be expensed on the income statement 
this standard was to become effective for us for the first interim period beginning after june  however  in april  the securities and exchange commission allowed for the 
table of contents delay in the implementation of this standard  with the result that we are now required to adopt this standard by calendar year sfas revised allows for either modified prospective recognition of compensation expense or modified retrospective recognition  which may be back to the original issuance of sfas or only to interim periods in the year of adoption 
we elected early adoption of this standard on july  based on modified prospective application 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting a change in accounting principles and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principles 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions  those provisions should be followed 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principles  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of change 
this statement becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
since the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional  fin provides that a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized if that fair value can be reasonably estimated  even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation under fasb statement no 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the standard effective as of december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
risk management we have entered into an interest rate swap contract to effectively convert the interest expense associated with million of our senior notes from a fixed rate to variable rates 
under the swap agreement  we receive fixed rate on the notional amount and pay a variable rate equal to three month libor plus an applicable margin of 
the variable rate being paid on the notional amount at december  was  including the applicable margin 
the maturity of the swap contract is march   matching the maturity of the senior notes 
this interest rate swap has been designated as a fair value hedge as defined by sfas no 
our interest rate swap meets the conditions required to assume no ineffectiveness under sfas no 
and  therefore  we have used the shortcut method of accounting prescribed for fair value hedges by sfas no 
accordingly  we adjust the carrying value of the swap to its fair value each quarter  with an offsetting entry to adjust the carrying value of the debt securities whose fair value is being hedged 
we record interest expense equal to the variable rate payments under the swaps 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement of million is included in other long term liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  the offsetting entry to adjust the carrying value of the debt securities whose fair value is being hedged is recognized as a reduction of long term debt on our accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 
at december   we had an outstanding principal balance on our unsecured senior notes of million 
by means of our interest rate swap contract  we have effectively converted million 
table of contents of the senior notes from a fixed rate to variable rate 
for the fixed rate debt portion of million  changes in interest rates would generally affect the fair value of the debt  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for the variable rate debt portion of million  changes in interest rates would generally not impact the fair value of the debt  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we estimate a hypothetical change in the yield to maturity applicable to our fixed rate debt portion of million as of december  would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of the debt 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate applicable to our variable rate debt portion of million would not have a material effect on our earnings or cash flows 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents included highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase 
due to the short term nature of our cash and cash equivalents  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
our operations are subject to normal hazards of operations  including fire  explosion and weather related perils 
we maintain various insurance coverages  including business interruption insurance  subject to certain deductibles 
we are not fully insured against certain risks because such risks are not fully insurable  coverage is unavailable  or premium costs  in our judgment  do not justify such expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
see risk management under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of market risk exposures that we have with respect to our cash and cash equivalents and long term debt 
we utilize derivative instruments to hedge our interest rate exposure  also discussed under risk management 
since we do not own products shipped on our pipelines or terminalled at our terminal facilities we do not have market risks associated with commodity prices
