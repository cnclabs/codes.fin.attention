item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction our primary business focus is on the development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of direct liquid fuel cell products for portable electronic devices  for the consumer personal and professional and military markets 
we are also working to develop and commercialize some of the other technologies we own or own the rights to  including the cellscan and a device that if successfully developed would be able to detect certain explosive materials 
research and development activities for our remaining technologies have recently been curtailed or stopped  based upon our decision to devote more resources to developing our fuel cell technologies and commercializing fuel cell based products 
in recent years we have increased funding of our fuel cell related efforts including our capital expenditures for the establishment of our production facilities  which we expect will continue until such time as we successfully commercialize our first fuel cell products  of which we can give no assurance  and perhaps thereafter 
results of operations from our inception in april through december  we have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately  including approximately  from amortization expense 
we expect to incur additional operating losses during the remainder of and possibly thereafter  principally as a result of our continuing anticipated research and development costs  increases in selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses related to the introduction of our products  cost related to commercialization of our fuel cell products and the uncertainty of bringing our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies to commercial success 
since our inception  we have relied principally on outside sources of funding to finance our operations  as our revenues have been minimal 
in july and august  we issued  aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes due july  less issuance costs of approximately  although we have received our first purchase order for our civilian power pack product which provides for large scale delivery during our first two years of product availability  we will not derive any revenues under the purchase order unless and until we commence large scale manufacturing of our first fuel cell product  which is targeted to commence during the first quarter of at the earliest 
until such time  we expect our reliance on outside sources of funding to continue until we are able to successfully commercialize our fuel cell or any of our other products or technologies  of which we can give no assurance 
our research and development costs have increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december   as we have continued to devote greater efforts to develop the technology underlying  and as we move to commercializing the products incorporating  our fuel cells  however  if we are unable to successfully commercially develop our fuel cell technology or any of our other technologies  we will be forced to curtail our spending levels until such time  if ever  as we generate revenues or otherwise receive funds from third party sources 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we sustained net losses of  during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in the net loss can primarily be attributed to increases in research and development costs primarily due to increased funding of our fuel cell related efforts as we move towards commercialization of our fuel cell products 
furthermore  during the year ended december  we incurred net increases in other expense which can be attributed to interest on our notes that were issued in july and august  partially offset by increased interest income earned on our cash balances and short term investments 
these factors were somewhat offset by a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  as more fully described below 
as we get closer to the anticipated commercialization of our fuel cell products  we expect that we will continue to devote significant resources in the areas of capital expenditures and research and development costs for our fuel cell products 
during the year ended december   we recorded revenues of  and cost of revenues of  compared to none during the year ended december  the revenues recorded in are attributable to an august order from general dynamics  pursuant to which we completed delivery of power packs and refueling cartridges to general dynamics during the fourth quarter of research and development costs  net amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in research and development costs incurred during compared to  can be primarily attributed to an increase of approximately  in costs related to our fuel cell technologies 
the research and development activities for the periods presented include fuel cell technologies 
we incurred costs relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  during the year ended december  compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the increase in our research and development expenses related to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  reflects our decision to continue to devote substantial and increasing amounts of resources to the further development of our fuel cell technologies and products as we move towards commercialization and result from increases in labor  subcontractor  materials and other costs 
cellscan 
we incurred costs relating to the further refinement of the desktop cellscan system and on various research activities of approximately  during the year ended december  compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december   for various research activities  refinement and assembly of the desktop cellscan 
the decrease in costs can in part be attributed to our decision to devote more resources to developing our fuel cell technologies and commercializing fuel cell based products 
other r d activities 
we have been devoting more resources to developing our fuel cell technologies and commercializing our fuel cell based products 
as a result  we have been devoting few resources to many of our other technologies 
we have  however  been working to develop a device to detect certain explosive materials 
after performing preliminary testing of the device in  we have made various changes in the device and continue to test different iterations with a view to exploiting our technology by developing a commercial product 
selling  marketing  general and administrative sg a expenses during the year ended december  amounted to  compared to  during the year ended december  the decrease of  for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a decrease in non cash charges relating to stock options and warrants of approximately  and a decrease in costs related to the issuance and maintenance of patents of approximately  offset by an increase in labor and executive consulting costs of approximately  an increase in professional fees of approximately  an increase in office expenses of approximately  and increase in depreciation expense on leasehold improvement of approximately  an increase in a non cash charge related to a reserve for a refund of land development costs of approximately  an increase in sales and marketing expense of approximately  an increase in insurance costs of approximately  and a net increase in various other sg a cost categories of approximately  amortization of intangible assets amounted to  during the each of the years ended december  and december  the amortization of intangible assets in both periods represents the amortization of intangible assets acquired in our march acquisition of the remaining of more energy ltd 
that we did not already own 
net other income and expenses which represent interest income and expense during the year ended december  amounted to a net other expenses of approximately  compared to a net other income of approximately  during the year ended december  the difference of  between the years ended december  and is primarily due to an increase in interest expense of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  somewhat offset by an increase in interest income of approximately  during the same comparative periods 
the increase in interest expense described above is principally due to our july and august issuance of  aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes due july  related to which we recorded interest expense aggregating approximately  comprised of  on the coupon rate   representing amortization of debt issuance costs and  representing amortization of beneficial conversion features during the increase in interest income during the year ended december  as compared to is primarily due to an increase in our cash balances and short term investments in resulting from our issuance of our notes 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we sustained a net loss of  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increase in the net loss can primarily be attributed to an increase in research and development costs as we increase funding of our fuel cell related efforts  and an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses including non cash charges related to stock options and warrants  somewhat offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets during the year ended december   as certain intangible assets have become fully amortized 
we did not recognize any revenues during the year ended december   compared to revenues of approximately  and gross profit of approximately  during the year ended december  the revenues recognized during the year ended december  were attributable to a january agreement to develop for a third party an application for the use of our inherently conductive polymers in its fuel cell products 
research and development costs amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the increases in research and development costs incurred during compared to  can be primarily attributed to an increase of approximately  in costs related to our fuel cell technologies and an increase of approximately  in costs related to our cellscan  somewhat offset by a net decrease of approximately  in costs related to our toroidal technologies  stirling cycle system  linear compressor and other research and development costs 
the research and development activities for the periods presented include fuel cell technologies 
we incurred costs relating to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  during the year ended december  compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the increase in our research and development expenses related to our fuel cell technologies of approximately  reflect our decision to continue to devote substantial and increasing amounts of resources to the further development of our fuel cell technologies and products 
cellscan 
we incurred costs relating to the refinement and assembly of the desktop cellscan system and on various cellscan research activities of approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   in order to move towards commercialization of the cellscan  we devoted a greater proportion of our cellscan resources to the assembly of additional desktop cellscan systems  as compared to the same periods in when we devoted a greater proportion to the establishment of cellscan research programs at third party medical institutions 
toroidal technologies  stirling cycle system  linear compressor and other costs 
we incurred costs relating to our toroidal engine and compressor  stirling cycle system  linear compressor and other research and development costs aggregating approximately  during the year ended december   compared to costs of approximately  during the year ended december  the decrease reflects management s decision to allocate less of our resources to the development of these technologies and more of our resources to the development of our fuel cell technologies and products 
selling  marketing  general and administrative sg a expenses during the year ended december  amounted to approximately  compared to approximately  during the year ended december  the increase of  for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase in non cash charges relating to stock options and warrants of approximately  comprised of approximately  related to the extension of the expiration date of certain stock options and warrants  partially offset by a net decrease of approximately  in other costs related to stock options and warrants  an increase in selling and marketing expenses of approximately  an increase in professional fees of approximately  an increase in labor and executive consulting costs of approximately  an increase in insurance costs of approximately  and a net increase in various other sg a cost categories of approximately  amortization of intangible assets amounted to  during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  the decrease for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to intangible assets acquired in our september exchange offer for shares of medis el that we did not already own becoming fully amortized during the year ended december   partially offset by amortization of intangible assets acquired in our march acquisition of the remaining of more energy that we did not already own 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through the proceeds of investor equity financing 
recently  as discussed further in this section  we issued our notes in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers 
we expect to continue to finance our operations through the sale of debt or equity until such time as we successfully commercialize our fuel cell products or products derived from any of our other technologies 
our working capital and capital requirements at any given time depend upon numerous factors  including  but not limited to the progress of research and development programs  the status of our technologies  and the level of resources that we devote to the development of our technologies  patents  marketing and sales capabilities 
another source of income or other means to affect our cash expenditures are collaborative arrangements with businesses and institutes for research and development and companies participating in the development of our technologies 
since january  we have realized revenues of  on costs of revenues of  as well as credits against our research and development costs of approximately  with respect to collaborative arrangements with third parties relating to our fuel cell technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will realize additional revenue or credits to our research and development expense from such collaborative arrangements still in existence or that we will enter into additional collaborative arrangements in the future 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will raise additional funds through any financing approach implemented by us 
in july and august  we issued  aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due in a private placement  less issuance costs aggregating approximately  interest on such notes is payable quarterly 
the notes were issued at par 
the notes will not have the benefit of any sinking fund and are convertible prior to maturity or redemption into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes or an initial conversion price of per share 
the notes are callable by us after two years if the closing price of our stock for at least trading days within a period of consecutive trading days immediately prior to the notification date of such redemption exceeds  subject to adjustment 
of the total  aggregate principal amount of notes issued   aggregate principal amount of notes were issued pursuant to the exercise of a day option that was granted to the initial purchaser in connection with the issuance of the first  aggregate principal amount of notes 
the remaining  aggregate principal amount of notes were issued and sold directly to a group of affiliated investors in a private placement 
in january  we issued  shares of our common stock in a private placement to an accredited investor for proceeds of approximately  in april  we issued  shares of its common stock in a private placement to an accredited investor for proceeds of approximately during the year ended december   option holders exercised outstanding options issued under our stock option plan  as amended  to acquire  shares of our common stock including  shares exercised by our chief executive officer  its president  its executive vice and its chief financial officer  for aggregate proceeds of approximately  of which  was received in january 
during the year ended december   warrant holders exercised outstanding warrants to acquire  shares of our common stock including  shares exercised by a corporation beneficially owned by our chief executive officer and its president and  shares exercised by our chief executive officer and its president  at exercise prices ranging from to per share  for aggregate proceeds of approximately proceeds from the above mentioned debt financing and other proceeds have been and will continue to be used for corporate expense and capital expenditures  including for the construction  start up and other costs related to a fully automated manufacturing line for our fuel cell products  as well as for other working capital purposes  and selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses 
on january   we terminated our  revolving credit line 
throughout the existence of the credit line we made no borrowings under the credit line and the credit line had a zero balance upon its termination 
during the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased levels of spending on operating expenses during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   particularly on research and development related to our fuel cell technologies which reflects management s decision to continue to increase funding of such activities as we move towards commercialization of our fuel cell products  as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities during the years ended december  and for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities was  which represents the following i capital expenditures of  of which approximately  represents costs related to building and equipping our fully automated and semi automated production lines and related facilities including  of leasehold incentive obligation and approximately  represents leasehold improvement and equipment costs related to our move to our new facility in lod  israel  ii investments in short term investments of  less redemptions of short term investments of  and iii long term loans granted in the amount of  this is compared to net cash used in investing activities of  for the year ended december   which represents the following i investments in short term deposits of  fully offset by maturities of  ii capital expenditures of approximately  of which approximately  represents leasehold improvements and other property and equipment costs for our new facility in lod  israel including  of leasehold incentive obligation  iii a loan of approximately  to gennadi finkelshtain  the general manager of more energy  under an existing three year promissory note dated april   as amended  made principally to enable him to pay the final installment of certain taxes arising in connection with our march purchase from him of the remaining of more energy we did not already own 
we expect our capital expenditures to continue to increase in as we incur additional costs related to establishing our fully automated production line 
for the year ended december   cash aggregating  was provided by financing activities  compared to  for the year ended december  during the year ended december   cash was provided by the financing activities described in detail above 
the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  aggregating  was generated from i net proceeds of approximately  from our issuance in january of  shares of our common stock to institutional investors  ii proceeds of approximately  from our issuance of  shares of our common stock in a private placement to an accredited investor  iii proceeds of approximately  from our issuance of  shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options issued under our stock option plan  and iv proceeds of approximately  from our issuance of  shares of our common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and  in short term investments 
this does not include an additional amount of approximately  of potential proceeds from the exercise of in the money options and warrants with expiration dates in and  though we can give no assurance that any of such options or warrants will be exercised 
even though we expect our cash outlays to increase as we build our fully automated production line  we expect our cash and short term investments of approximately  excluding the potential proceeds from in the money options and warrants mentioned above to be sufficient to support i our projected expenditures relating to such production line  ii other of our corporate expenses and capital expenditures  iii interest payments on our notes  which we expect to aggregate approximately  in  and iv our general working capital needs and selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses  until we first derive significant revenue from the expected sales of our power pack products  which is targeted to be during the first quarter of at the earliest 
we anticipate expending approximately  for tooling exclusively dedicated to our first fully automated line capable of producing approximately million power pack units a month  plus another  for various other facilities  including the fuel production line  the injection molding tooling and the packaging line which will also provide us the capacity for a number of future lines which we anticipate will be required to meet future growth 
we anticipate that there will be additional capital and other costs in completing our production capability 
in addition  management decisions regarding inventory planning to enhance the throughput and efficiency of the launch of our fully automated line could result in the use and need for additional financial resources 
our failure or delay to successfully commercialize or sell our fuel cell products or products derived from any of our other technologies would require us to seek outside sources of financing to raise additional funds for working capital or other purposes 
however  such failure may materially adversely affect our ability to raise such additional funds if needed 
in any event  it is not possible to make any reliable estimate of the funds required to complete the development of our fuel cell technologies or any of our other technologies or market and produce our fuel cell products 
commitments and contingencies the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at december  payment due by period contractual obligations total and thereafter operating lease obligation purchase obligations senior convertible notes note other long term liabilities note total note other long term liabilities represents our accrued severance pay as of december  since we do not expect a high level of employee turnover giving rise to the payment of significant amounts of severance obligations  we have included approximately of the total liability in each of the years through and the remainder in and thereafter 
note  aggregate principal amount of our senior convertible notes due tax matters as of december   for us federal income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  for israeli income tax purposes  we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  since our inception  we have not had any taxable income 
the availability of our us net operating loss carry forwards may be reduced to the extent one or more direct or indirect holders of or greater amount of our common stock increases their equity interest in us by more than in the aggregate 
grants obtained from the state of israel medis el  our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  received approximately  in research and development grants from the office of the chief scientist of the ministry of commerce and industry of the state of israel from its inception to this is based upon a policy of the government of israel to provide grants of between and of qualifying approved research and development expenditures to promote research and development by israeli companies 
medis el received of qualifying approved research and development expenditures  with  of such funds being allotted for the cellscan and  allotted for the neuritor 
pursuant to the grant arrangement  medis el is required to pay of its sales of cellscan and neuritor products developed with the grant funds until the grant amounts are paid in full 
there is no requirement to repay the grants if the products developed with the grant funds are not sold 
if medis el sells the underlying technology prior to repaying the grant funds  it must first seek permission from the israeli government for such sale 
prior to medis el receiving grant funds in  medis el assumed from israel aircraft industries inc  our largest stockholder  its obligation relating to the repayment of grants out of future royalties  if any  of approximately  as of december   medis el s total contingent obligation for the repayment of grants  which includes the  is  neither we nor medis el presently receive any grants from the state of israel 
approved enterprise under the israeli law for the encouragement of capital investments   medis el was issued a certificate of approval as an approved enterprise 
under the law  medis el elected the combined path  pursuant to which medis el had the right to receive a government guaranteed bank loan of of the amount of the approved investment 
in addition  medis el had the right to receive a grant of of the approved investment  in which case the loan would be reduced by the amount of the grant 
medis el received investment grants of approximately  and loans of approximately  the investment grants were used to invest in equipment  furniture and fixtures and commercial vehicles 
the loan proceeds were used for the above as well as to acquire know how  leasehold improvements  marketing and working capital 
the loans were paid off in full during the year ended december  additionally  the tax liability in respect of medis el s income deriving from its approved enterprise activities is calculated at a rate of of income for a ten year period  with tax on dividends distributed of  instead of 
these tax benefits expire in in september  more energy  our fuel cell subsidiary  was granted approved enterprise status 
the plan provides a two year tax exemption  as well as reduced tax for a period of years 
the benefits from the approved enterprise programs depend upon more energy fulfilling the conditions under the letter of approval and the laws governing the grant 
the commencement of the benefits period is determined beginning with the year in which taxable income is initially generated by the approved enterprise  provided that the earlier of years have not elapsed from the year in which the approval was granted  or years from the year in which the enterprise was initially operated 
more energy s initial approved enterprise plan was completed during and its status as an entity qualifying for tax benefits privileged enterprise will be governed by the provisions of the investment law  as amended see below 
on april   an amendment to the investment law came into effect the amendment and has significantly changed the provisions of the investment law 
the amendment sets forth the scope of enterprises which may qualify as a privileged enterprise under the amendment  the designation is privileged enterprise rather than approved enterprise by setting forth criteria for qualification of a company  such as provisions generally requiring that at least of the privileged enterprise s income will be derived from export and that minimum qualifying investments in productive assets be made 
under the amendment  the year in which the company elects to commence its tax benefits is designated as the year of election year of election 
a company may choose its year of election by notifying the israeli tax authorities in connection with filings its annual tax return or within months after the end of the year of election  whichever is earlier  or by requesting an advanced ruling from the israeli tax authorities no later than within months after the end of the year of election 
the investment law  as amended  also provides that any certificate of approval granted prior to the amendment will remain subject to the terms and benefits included in such certificate of approval 
accordingly  while it is anticipated that the investment law  as amended  will govern more energy s privileged enterprise terms and benefits  we do not expect that the amendment will have any impact on medis el 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate past judgments and our estimates  including those related to goodwill and intangible assets  stock options and warrants and deferred income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets we consider accounting policies related to our goodwill and other intangible assets to be critical due to the estimation processes involved and their materiality to our financial statements 
as of december   the net book values of our goodwill and intangible assets were  and  respectively 
our goodwill and other intangible assets arose primarily as a result of three purchase accounting transactions our acquisition of the minority interest in medis inc in  our exchange of our shares for the minority interest in medis el in and our acquisition of the remaining of more energy that we did not already own in in amortizing our goodwill through december  and our intangible assets through december   we made estimates and assumptions regarding the useful lives of such assets 
if our estimates and assumptions change  the useful lives and resulting charges to operations for amortization of such assets would also change 
additionally  with respect to our goodwill and intangible assets  as of january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which was issued by the financial accounting standards board in june sfas no 
requires enterprises  effective january   to discontinue amortizing goodwill  and instead requires that goodwill be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment 
as part of our initial evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets for any possible impairment  as of january   we were required to use estimates and assumptions with respect to markets for our products  future cash flows  discount rates and timing of commercialization of our technologies in determining the fair value of our reporting units 
we have also performed annual tests for impairment of our goodwill in   and the estimates we used assume that our products will be accepted and that we will gain market share in the future and will experience growth in such market share 
if we fail to deliver products or to achieve our assumed revenue growth rates or assumed gross margins  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if our estimates and or other assumptions change or other circumstances change with respect to future cash flows  discount rates and timing of commercialization of our technologies  we may  in the future  be required to record charges to operations for impairment of our goodwill and or our intangible assets 
stock options and warrants we also consider accounting policies related to stock options and warrants to be critical due to the estimation process involved 
we utilize stock options and warrants as an important means of compensation for employees  directors and consultants and also warrants as an instrument in our fundraising process 
accounting for such options and warrants  in some circumstances  results in significant non cash charges to our operations or accumulated loss 
there are assumptions and estimates involved in determining the value of such stock options and warrants and the timing of related charges to our operations or accumulated loss 
these estimates and assumptions include the expected term of the option  volatility of our stock price and interest rates 
the market price of our stock also has a significant impact on charges we incur related to stock options and warrants 
if these estimates and assumptions change or if our stock price changes  the charges to operations and or accumulated loss could also change significantly 
as provided for in sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation in accounting for its employee stock options  under which compensation expense  if any  is generally based on the difference between the exercise price of an option or the amount paid for the award and the market price or fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of the grant 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued the revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which we obtain employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the company or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the our equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this statement eliminates the ability to account for employee share based payment transactions using apb no 
and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using the grant date fair value based method 
we expect to incur significant non cash charges to operations on any grants of stock options to employees and directors subsequent to our adoption of sfas r on january  deferred income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to zero 
in the event that we were to determine that we are likely to be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be credited to operations in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
sfas r supersedes apb no 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
in april  the securities and exchange commission postponed to the beginning of a company s next fiscal year that begins after june  the required adoption date of sfas r 
early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued 
we will adopt sfas r for our fiscal year beginning january  and we expect that such adoption will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
the statement also requires that a change in method of depreciation  amortization  or depletion for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  sfas does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements  including those that are in a transition phase as of the effective date of this statement 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp financial accounting standard fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by us in the second quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of fsp to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of inflation and devaluation on results of operations  liabilities and assets in connection with our currency use  we operate in a mixed environment 
payroll is paid in our local currency and the local currency of each of our subsidiaries  such as the new israeli shekel nis with respect to our israeli based operations  as are most of our other operating expenses 
consideration for virtually all sales is either in dollars or dollar linked currency 
as a result  not all monetary assets and all monetary liabilities are linked to the same base in the same amount at all points in time  which may cause currency fluctuation related losses 
in order to help minimize such losses  we currently invest our liquid funds in both dollar based and nis based assets 
for many years prior to  the israeli economy was characterized by high rates of inflation and devaluation of the israeli currency against the united states dollar and other currencies 
since the institution of the israeli economic program in  inflation  while continuing  has been significantly reduced and the rate of devaluation has been substantially diminished 
the following table shows the rates of inflation deflation and devaluation appreciation of the nis against the us dollar for the years of through rate of inflation or deflation rate of devaluation or appreciation of the nis against the dollar additionally  in  through january  israel experienced deflation of and the rate of devaluation of the nis was against the dollar 
currency risk management on september   we entered into a capital equipment purchase agreement the agreement with ismeca europe automation sa ismeca to build an automated assembly line for our fuel cell power pack products 
under the agreement  we will pay ismeca approximately  swiss francs approximately  at the currency exchange rate in effect on december  for constructing the line 
the agreement calls for an initial payment of fifteen percent of the total contract price which was paid in october with milestone payments scheduled over the life of the contract 
based on a study performed by us  we have undertaken a currency risk management strategy for the agreement whereby we entered into forward contracts for the purchase of swiss francs in amounts equal to the initial that was paid in october under the agreement 
the last of such forward contracts expired on october  at which time we took delivery of swiss francs 
since the next payment under the agreement is not expected to take place until march  it is our strategy to monitor the value of the swiss franc in relationship to the u 
s dollar and to enter into a new hedging arrangement in the event that we recognize a trend of appreciation of the swiss franc in relationship to the u 
s dollar or if we otherwise consider it beneficial to do so 
accordingly  on january  we entered into a participating forward contract for the purchase of up to  swiss francs in order to hedge a substantial portion of the currency fluctuation risk in connection with the second payment under the agreement 
as of december   we did not incur any material costs related to the agreement as a result of exchange rate fluctuations 
impact of political and economic conditions the state of hostility which has existed in varying degrees in israel since  its unfavorable balance of payments and its history of inflation and currency devaluation  all represent uncertainties which may adversely affect our business
