critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of west marine s financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 

table of contents we believe our application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the financial statements  located elsewhere in this form k 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
lease accounting 
our accounting practices and policies with respect to leasing transactions include a recording rent expense starting on the date we gain possession of leased property  b conforming the lease term used in calculating straight line rent expense with the term used to amortize improvements on leased property  and c recording tenant improvement allowances received from landlords as an adjustment to deferred rent  reducing straight line rent expense 
deferred rent 
certain of our operating leases contain periods of free or reduced rent or contain predetermined fixed increases in the minimum rent amount during the lease term 
for these leases  we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected life of the lease  generally about ten years  including periods of free rent  and record the difference between the amount charged to rent expense and the rent paid as deferred rent 
tenant improvement allowances received from landlords are generally treated as deferred rent adjustments  reducing straight line rent expense over the life of the lease 
revenue recognition 
typically  we record sales  net of estimated returns  when merchandise is purchased by customers at retail locations 
when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse directly to a customer  we record sales when such merchandise is received by the customer 
return allowances  which reduce net sales for expected product returns  are estimated using historical experience 
comparable store sales 
we define comparable store sales as sales from stores that have been open at least months and where selling square footage did not change by more than in the previous months 
sales from the boatus stores acquired in january from boat america corporation were included in comparable store sales beginning in march merchandise inventories and vendor allowances 
our merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
inventory cost includes certain indirect costs related to the purchasing  transportation and warehousing of merchandise 
capitalized indirect costs include freight charges for moving merchandise to warehouses or store selling locations  operating costs of our merchandising  replenishment and distribution activities and a portion of store occupancy costs representing the estimated area used for storing merchandise 
indirect costs included in inventory value at the end of and were million and million  respectively 
we recognize indirect costs included in inventory value as an increase in cost of goods sold as the related products are sold 
we make certain assumptions based upon historical experience and current information to adjust inventory value for estimated shrinkage and to adjust inventory value to the lower of cost or market 
our reserve for estimated inventory shrinkage at the end of fiscal years and was million and million  respectively 
inventories are marked down to market value below cost based upon current levels of aged and discontinued product and historical analysis of inventory sold below cost 
our reserve for estimated inventory market value below cost at the end of and was million and million  respectively 
included in the reserve at fiscal year end is a million charge to pre tax income that we recorded in the fourth quarter  primarily for aged  excess and obsolete merchandise that we expect to sell below our cost 
we receive income for a variety of vendor sponsored programs and arrangements such as volume rebates  markdown allowances  promotions  payment terms discounts and for our compliance programs 
vendor allowances related to merchandise purchases are treated as a reduction of inventory value and recognized as a reduction in cost of goods sold as the related products are sold 

table of contents we establish a receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received from our vendors  which we calculate based on provisions of the programs in place 
due to the complexity and diversity of the individual agreements with vendors  we perform detailed analyses and review historical trends to determine an appropriate level of the receivable 
impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded  if required  for the portion of the asset s carrying value that exceeds the asset s estimated fair value 
we may also accelerate depreciation over the asset s revised useful life  if appropriate 
when evaluating long lived assets for potential impairment  we group and evaluate assets at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified 
at year end  we evaluated the carrying values of computer software assets in light of significant cost overruns  programming difficulties and uncertainties about the future use of certain programs being developed internally 
we determined that five major development projects  including applications for marketing  merchandising and replenishment purposes  were no longer expected to be completed 
accordingly  we recognized an million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of  primarily for capitalized labor costs and consulting fees for development activities  including programming costs  of software projects that are not expected to be completed 
certain computer hardware purchased in connection with one of these discontinued software projects is expected to be redeployed and  therefore  was determined not to be impaired 
we group and evaluate store assets for impairment at the individual store level 
we compare asset carrying values to the store s estimated future cash flows 
we believe that store asset carrying values and useful lives are appropriate at the present time 
asset retirement obligations and facility closing costs 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  we estimate the fair value of our obligations to clean up and restore leased properties under our agreements with landlords and record the amount as a liability when incurred 
we account for closed store and warehouse lease termination costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in the period we close a store or warehouse  we record as an obligation the present value of estimated costs that will not be recovered 
these costs include the book value of any abandoned leasehold improvements and amounts for future lease payments  less any expected sublease income 
these costs could increase or decrease based upon general economic conditions  circumstances in specific locations  our ability to sublease facilities and the accuracy of our related estimates 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses related to employee medical claims  worker s compensation  general liability and vehicle claims 
our reserve is developed based on historical claims data and includes an assessment of self insured losses that are incurred but not reported as of the end of the period 
the resulting estimate is recorded as a liability 
our assumptions are reviewed periodically and compared with actual claims experience and external benchmarks to ensure that our methodology is appropriate 
income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income  state tax apportionment and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
our tax filings are subject to audit by authorities in the jurisdictions where we conduct business  which may result in assessments of additional taxes 
we believe we have adequately provided for obligations that would 
table of contents result from these legal and tax proceedings where it is probable we will pay some amounts and the amounts can be estimated  in some cases  however  it is too early to predict a final outcome 
foreign currency translation 
in the preparation of consolidated financial statements  the assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiary are denominated in canadian dollars and translated to us dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date  income and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the reporting period 
the related translation adjustments are reflected in the other comprehensive income section of the consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
almost all of the revenues and expenditures of west marine are denominated in us dollars 
however  foreign currency gains and losses from transactions denominated in foreign currencies  including inter company transactions  are included in operating results and have not been significant to date 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement components expressed as a percent of net sales net sales cost of goods sold including buying and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss compared to net loss for was million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share  for net sales for fiscal year were million  compared to net sales of million for fiscal year other significant items that impacted fiscal year results include a million pre tax charge for reducing inventory value included in cost of goods sold  an million pre tax charge for cancelled software development projects included in sg a expenses  a million pre tax charge for discontinuing our use of the boatus tradename included in sg a expenses  and a million pre tax charge for the unamortized portion of loan costs related to the repayment of then existing debt  in connection with obtaining a new bank credit facility 
division sales net sales attributable to our stores division increased million  or  to million in  primarily due to the addition of new stores during the year  which contributed million in sales 
we closed stores during including four stores closed due to hurricane katrina  which reduced stores sales in by million  compared to port supply sales through our distribution centers decreased million  or  to million in  primarily due to increased sales to port supply customers through our store locations  which are included in stores sales 
net sales of our direct sales division decreased million  or  to million  partly due to reduced catalog and internet sales in areas where we have opened new stores 

table of contents comparable store sales we ended with a decrease in our comparable store sales of million  or 
results varied significantly between the first half and the second half of the year 
decreases in comparable store sales of  and  during the first  second  and third quarters  respectively  were offset by an increase of during the fourth quarter 
comparable store sales by region for were as follows southeast  northeast and western 
we attribute the decrease in comparable store sales to a number of factors 
high fuel costs persisted throughout much of the year  reducing boating frequency and the length of time people spent on their boats 
during the first and second quarters  extended cold  wet  winter like weather produced an unusually late starting and abbreviated boating season in the northeast  mid atlantic and great lakes areas 
during the third quarter and part of the fourth quarter  a record number of hurricanes hit our key southeast region  including hurricane katrina  which destroyed four of our stores  and hurricane wilma  which devastated large areas of florida with large boating populations 
in addition  post katrina consumer doldrums further dampened recreational spending across the country 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  in  compared to gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in  primarily due to a million reduction in vendor allowances earned on merchandise purchased during associated with an initiative to reduce inventory levels  as well as lower gross margins due to an initiative to lower retail prices on certain products 
management expects that as customer perception of our pricing policy improves  increased unit sales will eventually offset lower gross margins 
in addition  we expect the upward trend in the proportion of our private label merchandise sales to our total sales mix to continue to boost gross margins 
gross profit in also reflects a million charge to inventory value for expected product markdowns arising from shifts in merchandising strategies and consumer preferences as well as technological advances 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a the future profitability of our company is largely dependent on our ability to increase sales and gross profit while containing sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased million  or  in  primarily due to an million  or per share after tax  increase in payroll and related costs in our profit centers  mainly due to the addition of new stores in and  as well as an initiative to increase sales associate labor hours in our stores 
we did not realize a significant casualty loss during as a result of hurricane katrina  since we expect to recover from our insurer substantially all of the carrying value of property damaged or destroyed  subject to a deductible that has been satisfied 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred an million pre tax impairment charge relating to discontinued internal software development projects 
also in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a million pre tax impairment charge because we no longer intend to use the boatus tradename  except in limited instances 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased to in from in  primarily due to newly opened stores  which increase sg a costs without providing a commensurate increase in sales during the first year of operation 
we expect to open a smaller number of stores in  compared to the new stores we opened in accordingly  we expect the portion of sg a expenses related to new store openings to decrease in non capital expenditures incurred in preparation for the opening of new retail stores also called pre opening costs are expensed as incurred 
income from operations income from operations decreased million  or  in  compared to as a percentage of net sales  income from operations decreased to in  from in  primarily due to reduced 
table of contents vendor allowances and higher costs related to our opening of new stores  as well as non cash impairment charges for discontinued software development projects and discontinued use of the boatus tradename  as discussed above 
interest expense interest expense increased million  or  in  compared to  primarily due to higher average interest rates 
upon obtaining a new credit facility in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge to write off the unamortized portion of loan costs related to our prior credit facility 
income taxes our income tax rate of of pre tax loss in improved from of pre tax income in  primarily due to a tax benefit in the fourth quarter of relating to state enterprise zone tax credits

division sales net sales attributable to our stores division increased million  or  to million in  partly due to the addition of new stores during the year  which contributed million in sales 
sales at boat shows  tent sales and remodeled stores also were higher than in the extra week in our fiscal year calendar represented million in additional sales  mainly in our stores division  that are not reflected in results 
port supply sales through our distribution centers increased million  or  to million in  primarily as a result of higher sales to boat builders and yacht brokers  reflecting an overall growth in the market for new boats compared to net sales of our direct sales division decreased million  or  to million  partly due to sales lost to our own stores in areas where we have opened new stores 
comparable store sales while we ended with a slight increase in our comparable store sales of million  or  results varied significantly between the first half and the second half of the year 
increases in comparable store sales of 
table of contents and  during the first and second quarters  respectively  were offset by decreases of and during the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
favorable comparable store sales results for the first half of largely were attributable to poor sales during the similar period last year caused by bad weather 
comparable store sales during the second half of primarily were adversely affected by four hurricanes in our southeast region and higher fuel prices nationwide 
comparable store sales by region for  based on the similar week period the prior year  were as follows southeast  northeast and western 
gross profit gross profit increased million  or  in  compared to gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in  primarily due to lower product costs and increased sales of higher margin products  especially private label merchandise 
gross profit in reflects a million charge for the cumulative effect of certain lease accounting corrections  described below 
lease accounting correction like many other companies in the retail industry  in we reviewed our accounting practices and policies with respect to leasing transactions 
following this review  we corrected an error in our prior practices  the primary result of which is the acceleration of the recognition of rent expense under certain leases  mostly for our stores 
the million pre tax  or per share after tax  cumulative effect of this correction  of which million pre tax  or per share after tax  relates to prior periods  has been included in cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter of as this correction relates solely to accounting treatment  it does not affect cash flows or the timing of payments under related leases 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a expenses increased million  or  in  primarily due to expenses related to the opening of new stores during the year 
included in sg a expenses are million in costs directly attributable to the four hurricanes that hit our southeast region during the third and fourth quarters of we also recorded a million gain on the sale of certain real property located in ft

non capital expenditures incurred in preparation for the opening of new retail stores also called pre opening costs are expensed as incurred 
income from operations income from operations increased million  or  in  compared to as a percentage of net sales  income from operations increased to in  from in  primarily due to higher product gross margins  as described above 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  or  in  compared to  primarily due to lower average interest rates and lower average outstanding balances during  compared to upon obtaining a new credit facility in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge to write off the unamortized portion of loan costs related to a prior credit facility 

table of contents income taxes our income tax rate of of pre tax income decreased from in the prior year  primarily due to a million tax benefit in the fourth quarter relating to current and prior years state enterprise zone tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources our cash needs primarily are for working capital to support our inventory requirements and capital expenditures  pre opening expenses and beginning inventory for new stores and for remodeling or relocating older stores 
we also may require additional capital in the event we choose to pursue acquisition opportunities 
we believe our existing credit facilities and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs through operating activities during  our primary sources of liquidity were cash flow from operations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by operations during was million  primarily consisting of net income  excluding depreciation and amortization  of million and a million decrease in inventory  offset by a million decrease in accounts payable 
the inventory decrease primarily reflects a initiative to lower inventory levels and the related decrease in accounts payable is mainly due to lower merchandise purchases during capital growth in  we spent million on capital expenditures  mainly for store remodels  new stores and information systems software and hardware 
we expect to spend between million and million on capital expenditures during  mainly for store remodels  new stores and information systems upgrades 
we intend to fund our expansion through cash generated from operations and bank borrowings 
financing arrangements net cash used in financing activities was million in  primarily consisting of million of net borrowings under our line of credit and million received from the exercise of stock options and the net sales of common stock pursuant to our associate stock purchase plan  offset by million used to pay off our former line of credit 
on december   we entered into a new  five year  million credit agreement with a group of lenders that replaced the prior  five year  million loan agreement 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a million charge in the fourth quarter of  representing the unamortized portion of loan costs associated with our prior bank credit facility 
the amount available to be borrowed is based on a percentage of west marine s inventory and accounts receivable 
at our option  subject to certain conditions and restrictions  the agreement provides up to million in additional financing during the term 
the credit facility is guaranteed by west marine and its subsidiaries and is secured by a security interest in all of the accounts receivable and inventory of west marine and its subsidiaries  certain other assets related thereto  and all proceeds thereof 
the credit facility includes a million sub facility available for the issuance of commercial and stand by letters of credit 
the credit facility also includes a sub limit of up to million for same day advances 
at west marine s election  borrowings under the loan facility will bear interest at one of the following rates the prime rate announced by wells fargo bank  national association at its principal office in san francisco  
table of contents california or the interest rate per annum at which deposits in us dollars are offered by reference lenders to prime banks in designated markets located outside the us in each case  the applicable interest rate is increased by a margin imposed by the loan agreement 
the applicable margin for any date will depend upon the amount of available credit under the revolving loan facility 
the loan agreement also imposes a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving loan facility 
for and  the weighted average interest rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was and  respectively 
the loan agreement contains customary covenants  including but not limited to  restrictions on the ability of west marine and its subsidiaries to incur liens  make acquisitions and investments  pay dividends and sell or transfer assets

at the end of  borrowings under the previous credit facility were million  bearing interest at rates ranging from to 
at the end of and  we had million and million  respectively  of outstanding commercial and stand by letters of credit 
contractual obligations aggregated information about our unconditional contractual obligations as of december  is presented in the following table dollars in thousands 
total after years contractual cash obligations long term debt operating leases purchase commitments service contracts bank letters of credit assumes that our long term debt is repaid at maturity and not refinanced 
includes estimated annual obligation for principal and interest payments  based upon the loan balance at year end and the average borrowing rate in operating leases are the only financing arrangements not reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
operating lease amounts in this table are not reduced for sublease income and exclude costs of insurance  taxes  repairs and maintenance 
all but a limited number of our purchase commitments  which are not material  are cancelable by us without penalty 
we are a party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and obligate us to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as delivery of functioning software products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
we have also excluded associate employment commitments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as special purpose entities or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any unconsolidated special purpose entities or variable interest entities 

table of contents seasonality historically  our business has been highly seasonal 
in  approximately of our net sales and all of our net income occurred during the second and third quarters  principally during the period from april through july  which represents the peak months for boat buying  usage and maintenance in most of our markets 
management expects the seasonal fluctuation in net sales to become more pronounced as we continue to expand our operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not undertake any specific actions to diminish our exposure to interest rate risk  and we are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments 
a basis point change in the interest rate of our weighted average interest rate affecting our floating financial instruments would have an effect of approximately million on our pretax income and cash flows over the next year  and would have an immaterial effect on the fair value of our fixed rate financial instruments see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in
