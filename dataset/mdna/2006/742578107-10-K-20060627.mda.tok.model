a summary of revenue and assets by region can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
growth strategy we intend to continue investing in printing solutions and to leverage those solutions across our line matrix  thermal and fanfold laser products 
printronix believes our strong balance sheet positions us well to pursue growth opportunities across all three technologies 
printronix intends to continue to invest in high speed line matrix printer development and believes these high speed models offer an opportunity to replace aging prior generation line matrix printers and to fulfill the growing need for reliable  low cost  mission critical printing in emerging markets 
we continue to develop enhancements and new features to refresh the line matrix products and are actively designing improvements in ribbon inking technology for line matrix printers 
in fiscal year  we continued to place special emphasis on geographic expansion  particularly in china  to fully capitalize on the growth in emerging markets 
the company expects to continue to invest resources in high growth industrializing countries or under served markets around the world 
printronix expects to increase sales through the oem channel by expanding the sales growth program with ibm 
under this program in fiscal year  we provided field sales support for ibm and its resellers as well as telemarketing to the ibm installed base for demand generation in the united states 
the sales teaming program has allowed us to stop the decline in sales to ibm in the united states in fiscal year printronix has started deployment of this program in emea and other selected countries around the world during fiscal year ibm is the biggest channel to market and teaming with ibm in each region is designed to grow both line matrix and thermal printer sales  since ibm is a printronix oem customer for both of these printing technologies 
the plan is to continue growing the sales teaming in more countries into fiscal year this plan is a multi year program and results usually appear to years after inception 
printronix intends to grow revenue from the installed base of printers through demand generation programs  expanding channels for supplies and increasing services 
services include maintenance  repairs  spare parts logistics programs  and professional services 
particular focus is being placed on growing supplies and services in emea and asia pacific where our current market share is much less than in the americas 
we believe the growing importance of rfid in the supply chain presents growth opportunities 
printronix rfid products are recognized as the industry leader and we have a major share of that small  but rapidly growing market 
during  printronix announced a second generation of a high performance thermal product line with the introduction of the tr 
this new product line is rfid upgradeable in the field  has faster label printing  and is able to operate with applications written for competitive printers 
printronix intends to stay in front of the technology and more products are expected to be released during fiscal year throughout fiscal year  the company increased its market leadership in the rfid uhf  epc printer segment and believes we are well positioned to be a leading participant in the growing rfid thermal printer market 
throughout fiscal year  wal mart continued to expand its production rollout of rfid with its top suppliers 
by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  an additional suppliers were added for a total of wal mart suppliers actively shipping rfid tagged goods to a total of wal mart distribution centers and stores  an increase of distribution centers and stores 
wal mart has instructed the next suppliers to commence shipping rfid tagged goods by january   at which time they will expand the receiving centers to include up to distribution centers and  stores 
in addition to wal mart  other major retailers such as target  tesco  best buy and metro  and the department of defense have mandated rfid programs 
these mandates have 
table of contents set in motion a trend in advanced automation requiring suppliers to focus their resources on implementing rfid printing 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  printronix introduced the slr mp  the next generation family of rfid printers delivering true gen rfid encoding designed to epcglobal tm gen specifications 
these printers feature epcglobal tm gen certified hardware  rfid smart encoding technology and address a wide range of applications and global frequency requirements 
the slr mp now comes in both inch and inch models 
also during the third quarter of fiscal year  the slpar mp was introduced 
the slpar mp delivers true gen rfid encoding designed to epcglobal tm generation gen encoding specifications while meeting faster throughput requirements for automated rfid and thermal bar code labeling within manufacturing and distribution environments 
the slpa print  encode and apply system was co developed with fox iv  a leading label applicator provider 
finally  in fiscal year  we were also the first to commercially ship the multi protocol printer family for the korean  hong kong  taiwan  singapore and australian markets 
these printronix rfid smart label printers encode the label with a uhf radio signal  print human readable traditional bar code information on the label and verify the encoded information 
we believe printronix is well positioned to take advantage of the rfid roll out to cpg companies as momentum builds over the coming years 
we also intend to grow the non rfid thermal market share by expanding the channels to market to serve other vars value added resellers 
a new channel to market  scansource  inc  was added for thermal printers late in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and has been a growth factor in fiscal year rfid has provided printronix exposure to many of the leading global consumer packaged goods companies to which printronix previously did not have access and allows us to sell our other products  such as line matrix  thermal and laser because the customers can see the value offered through the common architecture  solutions and support 
the continuous form laser product line continues to be a synergistic fit within the existing sales structure and channels  and provides an important extension to the overall corporate range of products 
additionally  printronix has a relatively large installed base of older laser products that are available for upgrades 
therefore  a strategic decision has been made to bring updated laser products to market 
it is expected that these newer models will deliver higher speeds  longer service intervals  and better cost per page to drive upgrades and preserve the robust consumable revenue stream 
technology and product development printronix core technologies include line matrix and thermal print engines  subsystem controllers  printing system software  rfid smart label printing encoding  network printer management and bar code verification 
line matrix  thermal and laser printers developed from these technologies are unified by a common control architecture called printronix system architecture psa tm  the latest version of which is psa this architecture permits all three printing technologies to be application compatible by supporting common industrial graphics languages  host communication protocols  and global network management  thereby enhancing user productivity and printer up time 
printronix has designed and developed software and hardware that leads the industry in connectivity to allow the printers and applicators to operate in a wide variety of computer systems  software and networks 
in addition  emulation software has been developed which allows the printers and applicators to be placed in environments with equipment manufactured by others and seamlessly print the host data streams without the need for modifying the applications 
printronix printers are designed to print the local languages in most every region around the world 
printronix also offers advanced network printer management solutions with printnet  which is a combination of hardware and software components 
printnet is a web enabled remote printer management tool  combining printer diagnostics  troubleshooting  an alerting system and visibility that allows remote management of printronix printers anywhere in the world from a networked desktop 
printnet includes special printer capabilities  an interface card to provide connection to an ethernet network and a java based software application providing advanced configuration management tools  event notification  remote status and diagnostic capabilities 

table of contents in addition  printronix offers the unique odv online data validation capability that verifies all bar codes produced on t thermal printers are readable by bar code scanners  thus eliminating disruption and costly rework in the supply chain 
odv analyzes each bar code immediately after the label is printed and validates that the bar code is within specifications 
the t will automatically strike out an invalid label and print a new label 
odv also provides a quality control record of each bar code printed 
odv data manager  introduced in fiscal year  provides enhanced data capturing and reporting capabilities and the ability to evaluate data within each bar code 
rfid printers have a similar capability 
fiscal year was a significant year for new product introductions in line matrix  thermal  rfid and print encode apply technologies 
for line matrix  printronix introduced an entirely new printing platform  the p family 
this family is characterized by many user advantages  including lowered cost of printing  improved print quality  fewer interventions  ease of use and lower cost of maintenance 
the p family includes an innovative integrated print management system  incorporating a new ultra capacity ribbon  which provides complete system control of print density  optimized consumable life  and the ability to set specific consumable change points to meet application specific print density requirements 
the ultra capacity ribbon on the p provides up to percent longer print life than the prior p ribbons 
a new zero tear model of the p was also introduced  providing single sheet printing capability with no forms loss 
the p  launched on a worldwide basis  further extends the printronix technology leadership in line matrix printing 
new platforms and printer models were also introduced for the thermal  rfid and print apply product lines 
the new tr platform included many industry leading features all and inch models come standard as rfid ready allowing easy field upgrade when a customer later needs rfid capability  five competitive print language interpreters are included as standard features  odv and rfid interoperate on the same printer providing both bar code and epc data validation 
the rfid printer line was enhanced with a new platform  the slr mp this marked the industry s first introduction of a printer capable of encoding the generation epc standard a milestone in an industry that is converging on gen as the standard for the future 
the slpa family was also upgraded to gen capability and its performance enhanced to accommodate up to cartons per minute for applications on cpg conveyor systems 
printronix expects to be able to continue to provide rfid technology leadership  worldwide  through our focused investment in rfid research and development 
line matrix printers line matrix printing is accomplished as a hammer bank shuttles a small distance back and forth  enabling the hammers to place dots anywhere along a row across the paper or other media 
as the paper or other media advances  the hammer bank returns to print the successive rows of dots 
by increasing or decreasing the total number of hammers within the bank  the speed in which each individual row is drawn changes  creating different fundamental printer speeds 
by varying the speed of the shuttle and the distance of each step of vertical paper movement  a wide range of print resolutions can be achieved 
the dot placement of line matrix printers is very precise  permitting accurate character  graphics  and bar code alignment 
the combination of precise dot placement anywhere on the page and the use of overlapping dots enables line matrix printers made by printronix to produce graphic output  as well as letters and numbers 
another key feature of the line matrix technology is that hammer energy is very consistent  resulting in improved print quality on multi part forms 
these printers are available in tabletop  pedestal and cabinet models 
a special zero tear configuration enables printing on single sheets without any forms loss 
the standard resolution line matrix printers operate at    and lines per minute lpm 
the high resolution p h series printers operate at   and lpm for complex asian characters 
printer model capabilities are augmented by optional accessories  including printnet enterprise high speed ethernet connectivity  providing full remote printer management capabilities  and a power stacker 
the printers support a wide array of worldwide languages and character sets  a broad range of physical input output options  and a full line of host system support 
the result is a printer with connectivity to virtually every information system environment in worldwide markets 
uses for line matrix printers include reports  transaction documents  multi part forms  bar codes  labels  graphics and program listings 
the value provided by line matrix printing is the high level of reliability  the ability to 
table of contents function in harsh environments  the lowest cost per printed page  and the ability to handle difficult form sets and multi part forms 
during fiscal year  printronix refreshed the entire line matrix product family with the worldwide rollout of a new generation of equipment under the family model name p this family offers a broad range of enhancements targeted to appeal to existing users 
this new family employs an improved ribbon  which provides high quality  cost effective printing for the customer  while yielding higher revenues and capture rates for printronix 
our largest oem customer  ibm  has followed this same market strategy in an unprecedented level of coordination  helping to reinforce the overall message and impact in the market 
thermal printers thermal printers continue to be the printers of choice in the creation of on demand bar codes and label printing 
thermal printers create images on paper or other media by heat 
the image is created either by heating an ink based ribbon which transfers ink to the media transfer or by heating media in which the thermally sensitive ink is already impregnated direct 
this technology results in a readable bar code image as well as offers graphics and printing 
the value provided by thermal printing is the flexibility of high quality  fast  durable  on demand label printing from wired or wireless network stations along the manufacturing production line  distribution centers  or throughout the supply chain 
thermal printers may be either standard bar code and label printers non rfid  or rfid printers that include both standard bar code and label printing and rfid encoding 
the thermal printers range in print width from to inches and in speed from to inches per second 
they print at or dots per inch dpi 
the t wireless enabled thermal printer models were designed  engineered and manufactured by printronix  and they incorporate psa and printnet 
the t also offers the unique online data validation odv capability that verifies that the bar codes produced meet industry specifications and will scan accurately 
with printnet  odv and psa  the t sets the standard of durability  versatility  flexibility  and manageability to meet today s enterprise users needs 
an update of the product line the tr was announced in the first quarter of fiscal year this update has high performance controller architecture and delivers industry leading throughput and print performance  as well as being rfid ready 
the printers support both direct and thermal transfer methods and were designed to fulfill the demands of the high volume  mission critical industrial users 
it is the first printer capable of supporting multiple printer languages that were developed for zebra  sato  intermec  datamax and tec printers  as well as printronix pgl 
users may simply select the printer language and seamlessly integrate their printronix printer into legacy systems 
the tr series can be upgraded to rfid in the field and includes the ability to print with applications written for competitive printers 
as the industry s first standard rfid field upgradeable thermal printer  the tr offers customers the opportunity to buy a standard bar code printer today  with the flexibility to move to rfid encoding in the future 
radio frequency identification rfid smart label printers we believe printronix remains well positioned to be a leading participant in the growing rfid thermal printer market 
rfid technology has long been in use in products such as toll road transponders that identify automobiles to the transit authorities  for animal identification purposes and in libraries 
rfid labels increase the effectiveness of product identification by combining traditional barcode information with electronic data on the same label 
much like the universal product code upc used today in traditional bar code labels  the smart labels are required to use the electronic equivalent  the electronic product code epc 
the epc identifies the particular item in the supply chain by identifying the manufacturer  the product  and version with a unique serial number 
the microchip in the label has memory to accommodate the epc number 
there are various methods to achieve compliance with the wal mart dod mandate 
a primary method uses a printer to create the labels and printronix is addressing the needs of the suppliers who choose this method 
if a supplier chooses this method of compliance  the components of a typical rfid label generating system consist of three main items rfid labels  software  and a printer encoder 
the rfid label consists of a microchip with a 
table of contents flexible antenna embedded in the label stock used for traditional bar coded labels  and are known as smart labels 
the reader uses radio waves to scan the microchip via the antenna 
the reader can read the labels without the need for physical contact or line of sight positioning as needed in a traditional bar coded label scanner 
the rfid printers include a reader  sometimes referred to as an encoder  which encodes the microchip in the label and then immediately verifies that the label is readable 
many suppliers are choosing to automate this process by selecting a method that will automatically encode  print and then apply the label to a case or pallet 
with this method  a robotic system is used which integrates a thermal printer and rfid encoding system into a label applicator 
another method to achieve rfid compliance requires suppliers to attach an rfid label that contains only the antenna and microchip 
a printer is not needed to create the label with the antenna and microchip under this method  only an encoder 
we believe there are advantages and disadvantages to all methods  but each suits a particular mode of compliance 
rfid technology will improve supply chain visibility by allowing companies to know where every item in their supply chain is located at any moment in time 
one example of the expected benefits of rfid technology might be seen in the shipping of products from the manufacturer to the retailer 
as trucks are loaded  rfid technology will allow suppliers to tell customers exactly how many of each product has been shipped 
this should also enable better theft control since rfid technology would allow for continuous product tracking throughout the supply chain 
in addition  rfid technology should reduce problems like inventory stock outs by enabling more efficient demand planning and response as well as minimizing the potential for misplacement of in stock items 
finally  distribution centers can streamline the identification of inventory in process  which should lead to improved inventory accuracy  improved operational productivity and reduction of product shortages 
all of these improvements are likely to contribute to higher revenues  lower supply chain costs as well as better customer service and associated customer loyalty for end users of rfid technology 
epcglobal tm  which is part of gs formerly  joint venture of ean international and uniform code council ucc  is developing standards for the epc number 
together  gs constitutes member organizations worldwide with more than one million members from countries 
printronix is a founding member of epcglobal tm 
standards for the emerging rfid market continue to evolve very rapidly 
uhf frequency operational standards have now been set for the united states  canada  brazil  chile  australia  taiwan  singapore  hong kong  korea  india and the european union 
the design and protocols used by the microchip used in rfid smart labels is also evolving as the industry moves forward 
throughout fiscal year  the original four classes of chips available  epc class  class and class  and philips ucode  began to migrate to the new epc class gen chip that becomes the standard going forward 
printronix expects this transition to continue throughout fiscal year with many retailers setting sunset provisions for the older classes 
printronix now markets rfid offerings such as the smartline rfid desktop printers sl and smart label printer applications slpa  as well as a line of rfid labels to support the customers test and production requirements 
this provides our customers a full rfid print solution 
for rfid pilot development  printronix offers a smart label developer s kit that allows the customers to develop rfid printing solutions in a test environment before integrating these solutions into current operations 
we have developed software migration tools smt which enable a printer to automatically create rfid commands from existing legacy label bar code applications data streams 
printronix also offers an rfid integrator program that brings customers together with partners carefully selected by printronix who are rfid industry experts and technicians 
printronix has also developed a professional services staff that is leveraging its technical know how with the goal of supporting its customers in their migration to an rfid enabled environment 
this is being accomplished through consulting  label compliance and certification  and application migration and implementation support 
printronix rfid printers support the widest range of uhf rfid tags in the industry 
the company has adopted a collaborative  non proprietary strategy to openly encourage the availability of reliable rfid labels for printronix rfid printers 
to support this strategy  we are continuing to release rfid label guide specifications posted on our website to the rfid community for specifying rfid labels for use in printronix rfid printers 
given the wal mart dod mandates that eventually all suppliers use rfid tags on all pallets and cases  it is expected that the rfid portion of the thermal market will have significant growth potential 
being first to market with an epc printing solution  and through the significant level of focus on rfid technology  printronix expects to 
table of contents have market access for rfid applications beyond that which the present thermal market share might indicate 
while we acknowledge that there is at least one larger company now vying for a strong position in the rfid printer market  we believe that printronix remains positioned as a strong participant in the emerging rfid print opportunity 
fanfold laser printers the laserline printers combine print quality and speed with the distinct advantages of fanfold forms 
a straight through paper path and continuous forms media handling enables large batch production of labels and complex form sets that are not possible to be printed on cut sheet lasers 
fanfold laser printers create images by fixing toner on paper electrographically 
fanfold laser printing provides value with its high resolution  high speed batch printing and jam free operation 
the l laser printer operates at up to pages per minute ppm and dpi 
the l uses the more conventional heat pressure fusing process  supports form widths up to inches and offers a  pages per month duty cycle 
the l is primarily used for medium volume billing and labeling applications 
the laserline l fanfold laser printer operates at up to ppm  to dpi  and has a flash fusing process 
using a brilliant flash of light  instead of heat and pressure  to fuse the image onto the media  these printers can print on a very wide range of media and work with a broad range of label adhesives 
for example  unlike most other laser printers  the l can print on synthetics and plastic cards 
additionally  this process yields exceptional durability and quality that cannot be scratched off 
the wide carriage  which can print widths up to inches  high duty cycle and durability of the output make these printers particularly well suited for high volume  utility type billing and labeling applications 
bar code verification products a bar code verifier reads and decodes a bar code in the same manner as a normal scanner  but it also analyzes the adherence of the bar code to published industry specifications to verify that any scanner can read the bar code 
hand held portable models and online models are available that meet practically any industry requirement 
online verifiers are fixed to either printers or conveyance systems 
when attached to a printer  the verifier analyzes the bar codes being produced by the printer 
when attached to a conveyance system  the verifier analyzes the bar codes as labeled products traverse in front of it 
online models have an additional feature that communicates with the printers or conveyance systems and allows them to be controlled 
these control features can stop the printers or conveyance systems  sound alarms or alert operators that manual intervention is required if the bar codes are not meeting industry specifications 
when used on printronix thermal printers  they interact with the printer so the printer automatically overprints and voids the bad label  prints a new one  and the network manager is provided a record of the transactions through odv data manager 
supplies  consumables and services to support the installed base of printers and verifiers  printronix sells associated printer supplies and consumables such as ribbons  toner  labels  and repair or maintenance services 
line matrix ribbons are designed and manufactured by printronix  other supplies and consumables are purchased from outside suppliers 
printronix offers maintenance services and the advanced exchange program  which provides logistical support for spares and repairs  minimizing the amount of inventory needed by the resellers and channel partners to service the printers 
the printers are sold with warranties and customers can purchase maintenance service agreements from printronix or from the channel that cover the post warranty period 
printronix also repairs and sells spare parts to the channel  which are used to support their maintenance service programs 
we have emphasized sales and marketing efforts to capture an increasing share of the post sale recurring revenue stream 
supplies  consumables and services  such as maintenance  are an area of expected growth 
worldwide market for printronix products printronix markets products to manufacturers  distribution centers and retailers for use in mission critical applications producing bar codes  labels  tags  transaction documents and information reports  in which reliability 
table of contents and scannable bar codes are valued 
in addition  printronix markets products to information systems departments for use in producing multi part forms and reports 
the market for bar code verifiers consists mainly of companies that use bar codes as a critical source for data  that print bar codes  or that supply bar codes to other companies either as labels on products and or have internal quality procedures relating to bar codes  such as iso requirements 
standards for the emerging rfid market are evolving very rapidly 
as reflected in the most recent global rfid planning service study conducted by vdc  printronix has positioned itself as a rfid uhf printer encoder market leader 
printronix market leadership in calendar year is a result of the rfid initiatives in the americas and the launch of rfid in emea in fiscal year sales outside the americas were million  or percent of total sales in fiscal year and million  or percent of total sales in fiscal year our strategic geographic locations allow us to fulfill customer needs quickly 
warranties printronix offers warranties of various lengths to our customers  depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
we generally offer either a day on site repair warranty or a month return to factory standard parts and labor warranty on printer and verifier products to most customers 
the day warranty covers the cost of the parts and the labor to replace said parts 
the month warranty covers only the replacement parts 
defective printers and verifiers can be returned for repairs or replacement in the applicable warranty period at no cost to the customer 
supplies are warranted for the shelf life of the products  which can be up to two years 
seasonality revenue patterns are only somewhat impacted by seasonal fluctuations and are more significantly impacted by the level of global spending on plant expansion and refurbishment 
typical historical revenue patterns have resulted in slightly higher revenues in the third fiscal quarter ending in december as many of the customers and their end users are completing their fourth calendar quarter at that time 
in addition  we historically experience a drop in sales in emea in the summer months during the second fiscal quarter 
channel printronix markets and sells products worldwide through major computer systems companies oems  and a network of system integrators  full service distributors and value added resellers 
in addition  there are programs to market directly to major accounts large companies that can use all three printing technologies  are often multi national and are leaders in their industries 
these sales are accomplished primarily through the distribution channel or ibm 
all three technologies are largely intended for use in related applications and are marketed through the same channels 
channel sales as a percent of total revenue for the three fiscal years in the period ended march  were as follows march  march  march  channel oem distribution direct in the us and parts of emea  printronix builds products to order and ships directly from the factories to the end user in most cases  thus reducing our partners inventory levels and resulting in minimal printronix order backlog 

table of contents information on sales to our largest customers can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
competitive factors printronix products compete in the overall market for medium and high speed computer printers and rfid printer encoders 
the overall market includes line matrix  thermal transfer  rfid printer encoders  printer applicators  laser  inkjet  serial  and band printers 
printronix competes directly with several companies of varying sizes  including some of the largest businesses in the united states and japan 
printronix is differentiated from its competitors in several key areas that include mission critical printing solutions  integration into enterprise networks and efficient printer management 
the line matrix  thermal and fanfold laser printing technologies are unified by a common control architecture named printronix system architecture psa tm 
in addition  the company has provided post sales support in the form of supplies  spares  repairs and onsite maintenance services as well as professional services 
printnet enterprise printnet is a web enabled remote printer management tool that combines printer diagnostics  troubleshooting  an alert system and visibility to allow remote management control of printronix printers anywhere in the world from a networked desktop 
the printing solutions also offer direct connectivity to the enterprise software ie sap  oracle  thus eliminating costly middleware 
in addition  a unique online data validation odv tm  feature provides a differentiated solution in thermal printing for compliance labeling by monitoring bar code labels as they print to ensure scanability 
this capability  together with the odv data manager for network management  provides the architecture for rfid printing that requires percent readability 
printronix also designs  manufactures and markets hand held and online bar code verifiers that incorporate traditional and american national standards institute ansi verification 
we believe printronix printers are highly competitive with regard to features  reliability  durability  price performance  post sales support and cost of ownership 
the wide range of professional services enables our printing solutions to deliver their full potential in the customer s enterprise system 
although printronix s investment in research and development is above the industry average  we can offer no assurance that products with superior technology or superior price performance will not be introduced by competitors 
if introduced  those products could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated results of operations and financial position 
knowledge of a pending new product in the marketplace by us or by our competitors may have an adverse impact on revenue as customers may delay purchasing decisions until the new product is available 
the worldwide market for line matrix printers and options for calendar year based on the most recent market share data was million  excluding japan 
this represents a decline from calendar year as this mature technology is affected by competition from lower price laser and thermal printers  trends of decentralized printing and conversion to electronic forms 
as the market contracts  competition has consolidated to three leading manufacturers printronix  tallygenicom  and ricoh hitachi  with printronix continuing to hold the strong leadership position 
by being well established in the key high growth markets of china and india  both of which achieved year on year line matrix growth  the company extended its leadership position from percent for calendar year to percent in calendar year printronix s strategy in this mature market is two fold 
first  is to increase product turnover within the large installed base to provide users with more productive printing solutions and second is to gain more revenue from consumables and services to this base 
the cornerstone of this strategy was the worldwide rollout of the new p line matrix printer family 
the new p provides many features and benefits as well as improved consumable offerings over the older models 
the p provides a cost effective solution for existing customers who want to maintain the benefits and cost effectiveness of line matrix printing  but are experiencing increased costs of operation or reduced support on older models whose parts are becoming scarce 
the new offerings are being driven directly through to the end users via the demand generation team as well as a continued focus on direct major account engagement by the printronix sales force 
these new initiatives and the strengthening of active sales teaming with ibm have resulted in gains in fiscal year compared to fiscal year for ibm line matrix sales in all regions 
according to the preliminary global aidc planning service study conducted by vdc the most recent data available  the worldwide market for high end thermal printers for calendar year was million 
this 
table of contents represents a market decline of percent from calendar year excluding the rfid uhf printer encoder market segment  which is a subset of the market for high end thermal printers that is estimated to have grown at a robust rate of at least percent  the high end thermal printer market experienced a decline of percent 
printronix maintained market share in the overall high end thermal business with a slight decline from percent in to percent in  due primarily to a slowing of printer and accessory sales in europe 
the primary competitors in the thermal market non rfid are zebra technologies corporation zebra  sato  toshiba tec corporation tec and intermec 
together they account for percent of the thermal high end market 
our strategy in the rfid uhf printer encoder market segment is to continue to grow with the market and maintain our leadership position in this space  a small but emerging growth area  by providing innovative products that meet worldwide rfid initiatives including wal mart and dod rfid requirements 
printronix will also continue to pursue channel expansion strategies to increase share in the market place 
industry data on the fanfold laser market is not available 
the industrial fanfold laser market is a special niche market with few vendors 
we believe we continue to have a significant market share in this segment 
verification products offer a unique feature mix of fixed position verification scanning  online verification  hand held verifiers  communication and controls 
there is little direct competition at this time for online verifier products 
printronix is differentiated by the breadth of the product offerings  superior connectivity  a broader range of printer emulations  and higher level of integrated solutions over and above the development of printers 
we believe that the global presence  three application compatible technologies  advanced network printer management capabilities  unique odv capability and rfid printing solution leadership provide a competitive advantage 
business environment the business is affected by global changes in the level of capital spending to expand or enhance manufacturing plants  distribution centers and investments in information technology spending 
we believe the increasing importance of supply chain management  warehouse automation and the increasing use of bar coded labels offer opportunities for long term growth 
rfid smart label printing solutions are expected to contribute to this growth as a new technology that generates new buying decisions 
this fits into the corporate strategy of continually building user satisfaction within its installed base while developing printing solutions to support the next it infrastructure for those users 
the emergence of the rfid market has created new opportunities 
printronix has actively sought and obtained new alliance partners and rfid integrators in order to provide users with the whole product solutions and speed adoption of the new rfid technology for supply chain printing 
printronix also introduced the second edition of rfid labeling  a textbook that was written by printronix to train people for rfid development 
order backlog pursuant to our business model  whenever possible  the company builds to order and direct ships to the channel partners customer 
the manufacturing process of building to order is enabled by design and manufacturing for late point configuration of the end users unique combination of options  which achieves a rapid order completion 
in most cases  orders are shipped the day after they are received 
as a result  order backlog is minimal  represents approximately one week of sales  and is not a meaningful indication of future sales 
production and manufacturing we believe the quality and price performance of the products are instrumental to our success 
as a result  printronix utilizes concurrent design and manufacturing in the development of products by incorporating the manufacturing processes with the product design 
we source raw materials and components from a variety of suppliers and assemble printer products mainly in singapore and then configure to order to customer specifications in the us  holland and singapore 

table of contents raw materials printronix purchases custom and standard electronic and mechanical components from numerous outside suppliers 
most of those components used in the impact and thermal printers are available from alternate sources should an issue arise with the existing sources 
tooling is company owned and is typically transferable to a new source with minimal ramp up time to full production capabilities 
we also purchase certain components from sole sources and have no reason to believe that supply from these sources would be placed in jeopardy 
if printronix were to lose any sole source for a component  there could be a delay in shipment of printers requiring those components until an alternate source could be ramped to fulfill production requirements 
safety stock is typically maintained for such long lead time or single sourced items 
the laser printer products are designed to use specific proprietary print engines and printer assemblies manufactured by outside suppliers 
printronix has entered into written purchase agreements for these printer components and has no reason to believe that we will be unable to obtain the materials required 
engineering and development printronix operates in an industry that is subject to technological change  and the ability to compete successfully depends upon  among other things  the ability to anticipate market needs and to respond quickly with new solutions 
this is especially apparent with the rapid explosion of technology and applications associated with rfid 
the investment in research and development in fiscal year was approximately percent of revenue  higher than the industry norm of to percent 
this higher level of investment has enabled printronix to establish and maintain its technology leadership position in line matrix printing  rfid printing encoding and automated rfid print encode apply systems 
although we have invested at a relatively high level in research and development  we continue to focus on improved productivity and expense reductions 
engineering and development expenditures were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year printronix is committed to a product development process that is coupled to market requirements and opportunities  and that facilitates high quality  rapid  product development and introduction 
engineering personnel are located in all three key regions the americas  europe  and asia pacific and are connected by broad band communications and share the latest development tools 
for fiscal year  product development focused on a multi faceted  multi technology strategy introduce new printing platforms for all key technologies  extend technology leadership in line matrix and rfid  broaden product lines within existing markets  and enhance existing products to support regional expansion 
intellectual property printronix operates in an industry characterized by technological change and  as a result  we rely on patents  trademarks  copyrights  licenses to a limited extent with respect to software  trade secrets  non disclosure agreements with third parties and other rights we may have to protect our intellectual property 
during fiscal year  printronix was granted patents of which were granted in may and reported in the prior year k and no patents expired 
there were patents filed in fiscal year that are still pending 
as of march   printronix had been issued united states and related foreign patents associated with various aspects of its printers and other technology 
these patents expire from august to june printronix also has numerous rfid and other technology related patent applications pending 
printronix believes that its patents  in various technologies eg  line matrix  thermal  system architecture  printer control  bar code verification  rfid  have competitive value and we intend to enforce our patents against infringers where and when we deem it appropriate 
we do not believe the expiration of any of these individual patents will significantly or materially impact the financial condition or operations 
although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing any of the patents  we believe the patents are valid and enforceable 
however  patent litigation is risky  and unforeseen events or facts may make the enforcement of a patent unsuccessful 
therefore  despite our best efforts  we may fail to protect the patents and other intellectual property from unauthorized use 
in addition  our global operations and sales expose us to the risk that other countries may fail to provide the same level of protection for our intellectual property as afforded in the united states 

table of contents printronix has no material licenses from others pertaining to the manufacture and sale of products  including those under development  and believes none are currently required 
certain software is obtained under licensing agreements 
we believe  based on industry practice  any such licenses as might be required in the future could be obtained on terms that would not have an adverse material effect on us 
employees printronix had employees as of march   including in the united states  in asia pacific and in europe 
none of the employees in the united states or asia pacific is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
the wholly owned subsidiary  printronix nederland bv  is a member of the employers union fme cwm  and some of its employees have elected to become members of an employee union 
this employee union is not government sponsored and is supported by contributions from its members 
the company believes its relationship with its employees is good 
foreign operations printronix has a manufacturing facility in singapore  wherein line matrix and thermal printer products and some key components are produced 
the singapore facility also provides line matrix  thermal and laser printer configuration and distribution  printing solutions  product support and customer service for the asia pacific region 
we have a facility in the netherlands that provides product support  customer service  line matrix  thermal and laser printer configuration and distribution  and printing solutions for the emea region 
line matrix ribbons are manufactured in mexico for shipment to the americas  emea and asia pacific 
printronix has sales offices within germany  france  the united kingdom  austria  spain  the russian federation  united arab emirates  india  korea  china  singapore  mexico  brazil and australia

risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are based upon management s current expectations concerning future activities or events and their potential impact upon the company 
past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to forecast results or trends in future periods 
we can offer no assurance that future activities or events affecting the company will be those anticipated by management 
in addition  any of the following risks and uncertainties could adversely affect the business  financial results or financial condition and cause the actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements in this document 
other risks and uncertainties also could affect the business 
although we reassess material trends and uncertainties affecting the consolidated results of operations and financial condition in connection with the preparation of the quarterly and annual reports  we do not intend to review or revise  in light of future events  any particular forward looking statement contained in this document 
the information contained below should be carefully considered when reviewing any forward looking statements contained in this document 
we operate in an industry influenced by worldwide capital spending 
the products are used for mission critical applications in industrial settings such as manufacturing plants and distribution centers and also in information technology and back office operations 
the revenue is impacted by the 
table of contents worldwide level of spending for capital expenditures related to manufacturing plant expansion or refurbishment 
in addition  revenue is impacted by level of activity in the worldwide supply chain processes 
we operate in an industry affected by competing technologies 
the industrial printing market utilizes varying technologies including line matrix  direct thermal and thermal transfer  laser  inkjet  serial and band printing technologies 
across all technologies  the printers are characterized as high  medium or low end depending upon their range of features  including functionality and durability 
products made by printronix utilize line matrix  thermal transfer high end and high end fanfold laser printing technologies 
we cannot offer assurance that we can successfully develop the needed products and compete against current competitors or future competitors for mid range thermal and laser printers that are used in industrial environments 
even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a product  line matrix in particular  revenue could still decline as the market for the product matures 
we operate in an industry characterized by technological change and evolving industry standards 
the printing solutions industry is extremely competitive and is characterized by technological change  frequent new product development  periodic product obsolescence  evolving industry standards  particularly for rfid  changing information technologies and evolving distribution channels 
we must adapt quickly to changing technological  application and solutions needs  and the introduction of new technologies and products offering improved features and functionality 
we could incur substantial cost to keep pace with the technological changes  and may not be able to adapt to these changes 
although we believe that printronix currently competes favorably with respect to these characteristics  this may change in the future 
future success largely depends upon our ability to continuously develop new products with the quality levels customers demand  and to develop new services and solutions for evolving it infrastructure needs 
printronix spends a greater amount on research and development than the industry average because we believe that providing innovative products and solutions is important to future operations 
in spite of our efforts  we may fail to develop new products in a timely manner 
additionally  the new products we develop may not achieve market acceptance or may not be manufactured at competitive costs or in sufficient volumes 
if we cannot proportionately decrease the cost structure in a timely manner in response to competitive pressures  the consolidated results of operations could be affected 
we cannot guarantee the success of the research and development efforts 
any delay in the development  production or marketing of a new rfid product could result in not being first to market  which could harm our competitive position 
we must adapt quickly to changes mandated by the rfid industry standard setting group  epc global  and customers to maintain market share 
the failure to enhance the existing products  services and solutions or to develop and introduce new products  services and solutions that meet changing customer requirements and evolving technological standards would adversely impact the ability to sell products 
we operate in a highly competitive market 
the market for medium and high speed computer printers  printer encoders and related post sale supplies is highly competitive  subject to change  and is likely to become even more competitive 
printronix competes directly with several companies of various sizes  including some of the largest businesses in the united states and japan 
the competitors include privately held companies  publicly held companies and subsidiaries of multinational corporations 
some of the competitors may enter into strategic business relationships with other companies 
we cannot offer assurance that we can successfully compete against current or future competitors 
some competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing  sales  marketing and other resources than printronix and have achieved greater name recognition for their products and technologies 
we may not be able to successfully increase our market penetration or the overall share of the printer market in the face of such competition 

table of contents increased competition may result in price reductions  increased sales incentive offerings  lower gross margins  and loss of market share and could require increased investment in inventory  research and development  sales expenses  marketing programs and expenditures to expand channels to market 
competitors may offer products with superior market acceptance  superior price or superior performance 
printronix may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain current product cost reductions  or achieve future product cost reductions  including warranty costs 
customers may defer their purchasing decisions in anticipation of the introduction of new products or the actual introduction of new products by the company or its competitors 
if we fail to address the competitive challenges  there could be a material adverse effect upon the business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we compete in the rapidly evolving market for rfid for the supply chain 
we cannot guarantee to successfully compete against competitors in the rfid market  nor can we provide assurances that printronix will be successful in maintaining our market leadership or improving our market share 
while we believe the interest in rfid remains high  we can offer no assurance that the speed of rfid deployment will increase 
standards for the emerging epc rfid market are beginning to formulate 
epcglobal tm has issued a generation gen standard and products are beginning to come to market in accordance with this standard 
although printronix has taken an early leadership role in introducing a gen printer with an epc certified gen rfid encoder  we cannot guarantee to successfully comply with all aspects of these evolving epc standards 
while we continue to focus intently on rfid technology leadership  we also cannot guarantee that we will continue to develop such products or that we will address user needs effectively in an industry characterized by rapid technological change 
we have entered into several key strategic alliances with the leaders in rfid labels  software and integration services 
we cannot guarantee that these strategic alliances will be continued or successful 
we rely on resellers to sell our products and services 
printronix uses a variety of distribution channels  including oems and distributors  to market our products 
printronix may be adversely impacted by any conflicts that could arise between and among the sales channels 
we believe that our future success depends upon the ability to provide industrial strength printing solutions to a broader customer base and to maintain good relationships with the major oems and distributors 
we believe that continued purchase of the products by oems is dependent upon many factors  including oems desire to use outside suppliers rather than investing the capital resources necessary to develop their own products or their decision to end of life products that have low sales volume 
our dependence upon a small number of major resellers exposes us to numerous risks  including loss of channel and the ability to bring new products to market  concentration of credit risk  including disruption in distribution should the resellers financial condition deteriorate  reduced visibility to end user demand and pricing issues which makes forecasting more difficult  resellers leveraging their buying power to change the terms of pricing  payment and product delivery schedules  and direct competition should a reseller decide to manufacture printers internally or source printers from a competitor 
we cannot guarantee that resellers will not reduce  delay or eliminate purchases from us  which could have a material adverse effect upon the business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we rely upon a 
table of contents few resellers for a significant amount of the revenue 
in fiscal years and  sales to the largest oem reseller  ibm  represented percent and percent of net sales  respectively  and sales to the second largest reseller represented percent and percent of net sales  respectively 
sales to the top ten customers represented percent of net sales in fiscal year and percent of net sales in fiscal year the loss of any one of these resellers would have a material adverse effect upon the business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we operate in an environment of unpredictable demand 
we rely upon our ability to successfully manage the worldwide inventory supply chain and inventory levels to support uncertain demand in a cost effective manner 
the sales to resellers are made under purchase orders that typically have short delivery requirements 
although we receive periodic order forecasts from the major reseller  they have no obligation to purchase the forecasted amounts and may cancel orders  change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice 
significant increases in demand could result in inventory shortages  higher costs to obtain expedited materials and components  higher costs to expedite shipment to the customers  and or lost revenue opportunities 
significant decreases in demand could result in increased inventory levels  higher production costs  higher material and component procurement costs and reduced profitability 
the quarterly sales patterns have historically reflected a slightly higher than normal level of sales in the last few weeks of each quarter  making forecasting more difficult 
in addition  seasonality in sales also affects the business to some degree 
typically sales are low in the emea region during the summer months as the region generally takes extended holidays 
sales are also typically higher in the third fiscal quarter  which ends in december  as many of the customers are on a calendar fiscal year 
we cannot guarantee that these trends will continue or be supplanted by similar factors 
we have international customers  suppliers and operations 
for fiscal years   and  international revenue excluding united states sales accounted for approximately percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of the net sales 
we expect that international revenue will continue to grow and account for a significant percentage of the revenue for the foreseeable future 
the products are sold in approximately eighty countries around the world  which subjects us to risks that may be unique to a particular country  but also to risk factors that may affect the global economy 
the products are manufactured using raw materials and components that are acquired from sources around the world 
we use a large number of suppliers and regularly evaluate the availability of potential alternate suppliers should circumstances change with existing suppliers 
printronix relies on a single or limited number of sources for certain raw materials and components  although we attempt to have alternate sources where possible 
printronix internally develops most of the software used in its printer products 
certain software is purchased from suppliers through royalty agreements 
if we were to experience a sudden loss of availability of purchased raw materials and components or purchased software  we are unable to guarantee that we could quickly obtain the needed items from alternate sources 
the ability to ship the products in desired quantities and in a timely  cost effective manner could be adversely affected  thus affecting the business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
we rely heavily upon the international facilities to maintain appropriate inventory levels  manufacture products  and complete configuration of printers in a timely and cost efficient manner 
should we fail to successfully predict demand  we may not have sufficient inventory levels available to address customer requirements  or may need to use costly distribution methods  such as air freighting  to meet sales requirements 
there are many risks associated with international customers  suppliers and operations  including  but not limited to  the following compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulations  including export requirements  tariffs  import duties  health and safety requirements and other barriers  
table of contents fluctuations in freight and duty costs and disruptions at important geographic points of exit and entry  differences in intellectual property protections  differences in technology standards or customer requirements  the possibility of defective parts from suppliers  difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax efficient manner and changes in tax laws  currency fluctuations and restrictions on currency movements  economic instability  including inflation  recession and interest rate fluctuations  longer accounts receivable cycles and financial instability  local labor regulations  trade protection measures and regulations  risk of loss of the international assets due to political or economic instability  political or civil turmoil  war or conflict abroad or in the united states  natural disasters  such as earthquakes  floods  tsunamis and typhoons  consequences resulting from armed military conflict  terrorist attacks or other armed hostilities abroad or in the united states  and outbreaks of infectious disease such as avian flu  severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or other public health issues 
printronix is substantially self insured for losses and business interruptions stemming from terrorist attacks  armed conflicts  war  power shortages and natural disasters 
california and other parts of the united states have experienced major power shortages and blackouts and could experience them in the future  which could disrupt the business or that of the suppliers or customers 
the corporate headquarters and research and development activities are located in california  near known earthquake faults 
it is impossible to predict any ultimate impact on business  but consolidated results of operations and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake 
printronix operates in many countries with differing and sometimes conflicting income tax requirements 
the company s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by overlapping or differing tax laws  changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing income tax rates and unfavorable outcomes of future audits by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions 
in particular  the realization of deferred tax assets  which are predominately in the united states  depends on the ability to generate future taxable income in the united states 
failure to manage the risks posed by our international customers  suppliers and operations could have a material adverse effect upon the business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
environmental laws and regulations and unforeseen costs could impact the future earnings 
printronix could incur substantial costs  including clean up costs  fines  sanctions  property damage claims and personal injury claims  if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if the products become non compliant with environmental laws 

table of contents we face increasing complexity in the product design and procurement operations due to new and upcoming environmental regulations under various federal  state  and international laws  including the restrictions imposed in the european union the restriction of hazardous substance directive rohs  which places restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronics  and the european union waste electrical and electronic equipment directive weee  which makes producers of electrical goods  including computers and printers  responsible for collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of recovered products  and other similar legislation  including similar legislation currently proposed for china 
there is substantial complexity associated with compliance with these new regulations and the costs of implementation are not easily quantifiable 
we depend on the ability to attract and retain key personnel and future changes in equity compensation accounting could adversely affect earnings 
the ability to attract and to retain key  highly qualified personnel  both technical and managerial  is critical to printronix s success 
developing  manufacturing and marketing the products is a complex process and requires significant expertise to meet customers specifications 
competition for personnel  particularly qualified engineers and employees with expertise in rfid applications  is keen 
the loss of a significant number of key personnel  as well as the failure to recruit and train additional key personnel in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect upon the business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in the future  printronix will be required to record a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants 
as a result  we may incur increased compensation costs and may need to change the equity compensation structure  and find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  all of which could impact the business 
intellectual property is important to our success 
a third party may assert that printronix  or customers indemnified by us  violate their intellectual property 
a third party claiming infringement also may obtain an injunction or other equitable relief  which effectively could block the distribution or sale of allegedly infringing products 
the departure of any of the key management and technical personnel  or breach of non disclosure obligations  or the failure to achieve the intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse effect upon the business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
also as new technologies emerge  such as rfid  standards are also developing and the intellectual property rights of parties involved in their development can be uncertain 
printronix relies upon patents to protect intellectual property 
we execute confidentiality and non disclosure agreements as needed and limit access to  and distribution of  the proprietary information  however  we cannot guarantee that the efforts to protect the intellectual property will be successful 
the ability to compete successfully and to achieve future revenue growth depends  in part  upon the ability to protect the proprietary technology and to operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
we may fail to do so 
such infringement claims  whether or not valid  could result in substantial costs  diversion of management s attention and resources from the ongoing business 
claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign products  enter into costly settlement or licensing agreements or pay costly damage awards 
even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs  the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual agreement to us 
our stock price is volatile 
the stock price has fluctuated and we expect that it will continue to do so 
many factors can influence the stock price  including but not limited to the announcement of new products or innovations by printronix or competitors  changes in the levels of quarterly revenue or net income  
table of contents failure to successfully execute planned cost reductions could result in product costs and expenses that are greater than expected  and speculation in the press or investment community about the company  in particular as it relates to rfid 
investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices  consolidated financial condition  or results of operations or cash flows 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none item properties printronix owns a facility measuring approximately  square feet in irvine  california  which houses the us operations  sales support  engineering and development and also is the company headquarters 
this facility secures the company s million of long term debt 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for additional discussion 
in september  management closed the company s leased facility in memphis 
related expenditures were approximately million  which included charges for fixed asset write offs  severance  and other costs 
the closure of this facility did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
foreign operations are located in singapore  the netherlands and mexico 
singapore operations are in a facility owned by printronix  which was constructed in fiscal year and totals approximately  square feet 
the singapore facility is subject to a land lease  which expires in the year the netherlands operations are in leased facilities of approximately  square feet 
the lease on the netherlands facilities is an annual lease that is automatically extended from year to year and currently expires in june the mexico operations are in leased facilities of approximately  square feet 
the lease on the mexico facilities expires in september and lease renewal is not expected to present any issues 
the company believes it can readily obtain appropriate additional space as may be required at competitive rates by extending expiring leases or finding alternative space 
printronix also leases several small offices  generally on short term leases  throughout the united states  asia pacific  europe and the middle east for sales  support or service 
the company believes that its facilities are in good operating condition

item legal proceedings environmental assessment barranca parkway sites in january and march  printronix was notified by the california regional water quality control board santa ana region the board that ground under one of the former production plants and ground adjacent to property previously occupied by us was thought to be contaminated with various chlorinated volatile organic compounds vocs 
evidence adduced from site studies undertaken to date indicates that compounds containing the vocs were not used by printronix during its tenancy  but were used by the prior tenant during its long term occupancy of the site 
in august  printronix responded to an inquiry from the california department of toxic substance control the department regarding the operations at the site of the former production plant 
in february  the department submitted a proposed corrective action consent agreement to printronix  which would require printronix to perform an investigation of the site that would be used as a basis to determine what  if any  remediation activities would be required of printronix 
the corrective action consent agreement has not yet been agreed upon or executed 
during fiscal year  the department agreed to include the prior tenant of the site in the ongoing inquiry 
printronix has agreed to perform an initial environmental test  which we believe will further support the claim that printronix did not use the vocs in question 
in may  printronix and the prior tenant referred to 
table of contents above were jointly issued an enforcement order in respect to barranca parkway  irvine  ca 
the enforcement order requires both parties to a evaluate if interim measures are required and take action if necessary  b perform an investigation of the site and c take corrective measures if contaminants are found 
the enforcement order allows an appeal  which was filed on june  we are convinced that we bear no responsibility for any contamination at the site and we intend to defend vigorously any action that might be brought against us with respect thereto 
as of march  and march   printronix continued to maintain an accrual for million  included in accrued liabilities other  which is believed to be a reasonable estimate to cover any additional expenses for environmental tests the board may request 
denova site in august  printronix was notified by the environmental protection agency the epa that clean up costs had been incurred at an authorized facility used by printronix and approximately  other companies for the disposal of certain toxic wastes 
printronix joined with a group of the companies contacted by the epa and collectively negotiated a settlement with the epa 
our share of the settlement is thousand and is reported in the balance sheet with accrued liabilities other as of march  restriction of hazardous substance directive rohs directive ec on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment will be enforced throughout the european community starting july  rohs restricts the use of six substances lead  mercury  cadmium  hexavalent chromium  polybrominated biphenyls pbb or polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbde  within electrical and electronic equipment 
we are reviewing each of our products for the substances banned under rohs  and expect to be compliant by the effective date  except for fanfold laser printer models  which are expected to be replaced later in fiscal year as of march   there was no impairment to our products or environmental liability with respect to rohs 
legal matters we are involved in various claims and legal matters in the ordinary course of business 
we do not believe these matters will have a material adverse effect upon the consolidated results of operations or financial condition
