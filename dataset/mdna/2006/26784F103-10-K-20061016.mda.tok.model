item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the information contained in the company s consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
statements regarding future economic performance  management s plans and objectives  and any statements concerning its assumptions related to the foregoing contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation constitute forward looking statements 
certain factors  which may cause actual results to vary materially from these forward looking statements  accompany such statements or appear elsewhere in this report  including without limitation  the factors disclosed under risk factors 
general sales consist primarily of charges to customers for delivery services and weekly or monthly charges for recurring services  such as facilities management 
sales are recognized when the service is performed 
the yield value per transaction for a particular service is dependent upon a number of factors including size and weight of articles transported  distance transported  special handling requirements  requested delivery time and local market conditions 
generally  articles of greater weight transported over longer distances and those that require special handling produce higher yields 
cost of sales consists of costs relating directly to performance of services  including driver and messenger costs  third party delivery charges  warehousing and sorting expenses  insurance and workers compensation costs 
substantially all of the drivers used by the company provide their own vehicles  and more than are independent contractors as opposed to employees of the company 
drivers and messengers are generally compensated based on a percentage of the delivery charge 
consequently  the company s driver and messenger costs are variable in nature 
to the extent that delivery personnel are employees of the company  employee benefit costs related to them  such as payroll taxes and insurance  are also included in cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a include salaries  wages and benefit costs incurred at the business center level related to taking orders and dispatching drivers and messengers  as well as administrative costs related to such functions 
also included in sg a expenses are regional and corporate level marketing and administrative costs and occupancy costs related to business center and corporate locations 
generally  the company s on demand services provide higher gross profit margins than do local and regional distribution or fleet management services because driver payments for on demand services are generally lower as a percentage of sales from such services due primarily to the smaller size of the vehicle required 
however  scheduled distribution and fleet management services generally have fewer administrative requirements related to order taking  dispatching drivers and billing 
as a result of these variances  the company s gross profit margin is dependent in part on the mix of business for a particular period 
during the years ended july  and  sales to office depot  inc represented approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenue 
sales to the company s five largest customers  including office depot  represented approximately and of the company s consolidated sales for the years ended july  
table of contents and  respectively 
the company has no significant investment in transportation equipment 
depreciation and amortization expense primarily relates to office  communication  it equipment and software and intangible assets 
a significant portion of the company s sales is generated in canada 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately   and  respectively  of the company s sales were generated in canada 
before deduction of corporate costs  the majority of which are incurred in the us  the cost structure of the company s operations in the us and in canada is similar 
the conversion rate of canadian dollars to us dollars increased during the fiscal year ending july  compared to july  and increased during the fiscal year ending july  compared to july  as the canadian dollar is the functional currency for the company s canadian operations  these changes in the exchange rate have affected the company s reported sales 
the effect of these changes on the company s net income for the fiscal years ended july   and has not been significant  although there can be no assurance that fluctuations in such currency exchange rate will not  in the future  have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company believes that the following are its most significant accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
the company reviews all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their issuance 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized after services are rendered to customers 
there may be a time lag between pickup and delivery and the generation of an invoice 
accordingly  unbilled revenue is recognized for those shipments that have been delivered but have not been invoiced 
intangibles intangibles arise from acquisitions accounted for as purchased business combinations and include goodwill  covenants not to compete and other identifiable intangibles and from the payment of financing costs associated with the company s credit facility 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over all tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired 
effective august  the company adopted sfas no 
 which requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that the company identify reporting units for the purposes of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill 
the company s operations are conducted in two geographic regions  canada and the united states 
these two regions were identified as reporting units in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
because discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of these regions 
in fiscal  management performed a valuation on each of these reporting units and recognized a goodwill impairment loss of million 
the company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year 
based on this test  the fair value of the goodwill exceeded the carrying amount in all periods subsequent to fiscal other intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from to years 
other assets recoverable contract contingency costs the company has recorded as an other asset certain costs related to contractually reimbursable contingency costs incurred in connection with the launch of certain contracts in accordance with eitf  accounting for pre production costs related to long term supply arrangements  these costs will be recovered during the initial contract term  from a designated portion of the unit price specified in the contract 
should the contract be cancelled for any reason  the customer is obligated to reimburse the company for any unamortized balance 
total recoverable contract contingency costs capitalized at july  amount to thousand 
self insured claims liability the company is primarily self insured for us workers compensation claims 
a 
table of contents liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but unreported losses  are recorded based on the company s estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred 
the company s estimates are based on actual experience and historical assumptions of development of unpaid liabilities over time 
factors affecting the determination of amounts to be accrued for workers compensation claims include  but are not limited to  cost  frequency  or payment patterns resulting from new types of claims  the hazard level of our operations  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions  court interpretations  changes in the medical conditions of claimants and economic factors such as inflation 
the method of calculating the estimated accrued liability for workers compensation claims is subject to inherent uncertainty 
if actual results are less favorable than what are used to calculate the accrued liability  the company would have to record expenses in excess of what has already been accrued 
effective july  the company elected to become primarily self insured for vehicle liability claims 
the company estimates its liability for claims in a manner similar to workers compensation claims 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make payments when due or within a reasonable period of time thereafter 
estimates are used in determining this allowance based on the company s historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a percentage of accounts receivable by aging category 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company reduced its allowance at july  to approximately from the july  allowance of approximately of outstanding accounts receivable as a result of a significant reduction in accounts over days 
income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting 
the net deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
during the year ended july   the company repatriated approximately million from its canadian subsidiary 
except for certain applicable state income taxes  the company was able to offset the us income tax liability arising from the dividends with foreign tax credits 
the company generated unused foreign tax credits related to its canadian operations and other tax credits of million 
the company establishes valuation allowances in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes sfas no 

during the year ended july   the company determined that it was more likely than not that the benefits of the taxable us net operating losses nol totaling million at january  would be realized  and based on such determination  the company reversed the valuation allowance during the second quarter of the fiscal year  resulting in a credit to income tax expense of approximately million 
the company utilized substantially all of the nol during the and fiscal years 
the company s current valuation allowance of approximately million relates to a foreign tax credit carryforward compared to a similar valuation allowance of at july  the company continually reviews the adequacy of its valuation allowances and adjusts the allowances for changes in expected realization 
stock based compensation statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations

under the modified prospective method of adoption selected by the company  stock based employee compensation cost recognized in  and was substantially the same as that which would have been recognized had the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r been applied to all awards granted after august  the fair value of each grant was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in   and 
table of contents  respectively dividend yield of for all years  expected volatility of   and  risk free interest rate of   and  and expected lives of an average of years for options granted to employees and of years for options granted to non employee directors for all years 
the weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the years  and was  and  respectively 
as discussed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  option expense in  and amounted to   and  respectively  under the fair value approach 
based on the outstanding and unvested awards as of july   the anticipated effect on net income for fiscal  net of taxes  will be approximately foreign currency translation assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated at average rates during the year 
the net exchange differences resulting from these translations are recorded in stockholders equity 
where amounts denominated in a foreign currency are converted into us dollars by remittance or repayment  the realized exchange differences are included as other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations

sales increased million to million in fy  an increase of compared to the prior year 
the average conversion rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar increased over the prior year period  which had the effect of increasing sales for the year by approximately million  approximately  had the conversion rate been the same as the prior year period 
also  higher fuel surcharges included in consolidated sales accounted for an estimated of the increase in sales this year compared to the prior year 
the core growth rate  the rate excluding the impact of fuel surcharges and foreign exchange rate fluctuations  was approximately for the year ended july  approximately in the us and in canada compared to the prior year 
the core growth rate was negatively impacted by higher customer attrition  principally in the us  a significant portion of which occurred in the second fiscal quarter caused by service issues with a few customers and our decision to exit certain business relationships where margins were less than satisfactory 
canadian sales including fuel surcharges  in canadian dollars  increased approximately in the current fiscal year compared to the prior year 

table of contents cost of sales for fy increased million to million  and represented of sales  the same percentage as the prior year 
approximately million of the dollar increase in the current fiscal year resulted from actual cost increases while approximately million was attributable to the strengthening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
the total cost of sales  as a percent of sales  was unchanged from the prior year although purchased transportation cost increased as a percentage of sales to from in the change in business mix along with the impact of the spike in fuel prices in the first quarter of the current fiscal year are the primary reasons for the increase 
other cost of sales declined as a percentage of sales to in compared to in primarily as a result of lower insurance costs 
sg a expenses increased million  or in fy  to million compared to million in fy but remained constant as a percentage of sales at in both years 
approximately million of the dollar increase is attributable to the strengthening of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
excluding the impact of the exchange rate  the primary increase in sg a was for compensation and benefits related to additional personnel including higher payroll taxes  normal increases in compensation  severance costs  higher stock option expense and higher premiums related to medical and dental coverage 
in addition  the current year includes costs for additional space and communications for new business startups along with higher utility costs

net income for fy included a million income tax benefit from the recognition of available us net operating losses not previously recognized 
excluding income taxes from the comparison  income before taxes increased to million for fy compared to the prior year 
this improvement results from higher gross profit from increased sales and lower interest expense that was offset  in part  by higher selling  general administrative expense 
sales increased million to million in fy  an increase of compared to the prior year 
the average conversion rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar increased over the prior year period  which had the effect of increasing sales for the year by approximately million had the conversion rate been the same as the prior year period

cost of sales increased as a percentage of sales over the last three quarters of fy due to the increase in purchased transportation  the result of the continuing change in business mix  our decision to modify a number of route networks for certain clients that was triggered by changes to their distribution models and more recently  by rapidly rising fuel costs 
while we have been proactive in assisting our clients with route optimization  the result is generally reduced revenues from those customers without a proportionate reduction in transportation costs  thereby adversely impacting our cost of sales percentage on those routes 
likewise  the rapid rise in fuel costs principally in the th quarter had a negative impact on our ability to recover those costs from our customers as quickly as the fuel prices were escalating 
as a result  our structure for fuel surcharge compensation to our drivers was not always 
table of contents occurring on a timely basis 
therefore  to resolve the issue on a short term basis  we increased the commissions paid to our drivers in order to maintain service quality 
we began to approach customers  where fuel price mechanisms included an extended period for determining the surcharge  to shorten the period and their response has been positive 
however  those changes were not completed until the middle of the first quarter of fy sg a expenses increased million  or for fy  to million compared to million in fy but decreased as a percentage of sales from in to in approximately million of the increase is due to the increase in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
other increases are primarily attributable to the cost of additional personnel required to operate and manage new business added during  the increase in personnel and associated costs related to the growth of the sales organization and the higher audit and outside professional fees associated with sarbanes oxley compliance

as of july  the company had outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal compared to million and million in the years ended july  and  respectively 
the difference between the statutory rates and the effective federal income tax rates is primarily attributable to foreign and state income taxes  changes in the valuation allowance on net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits  and other expenses that are non deductible for tax purposes

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb reached a consensus on eitf  determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements  which requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination or purchased subsequent to the inception of a lease be amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes renewals that are reasonably assured at the date of the business combination or purchase 
eitf is effective for periods beginning after july  the company does not expect the provisions of this consensus to have any impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting changes and error corrections sfas which replaces accounting principles board opinions no 
accounting changes and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 

sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes retrospective application  for the latest practicable date  as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction of an error 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have any impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb decided to move forward with the issuance of a final fasb staff position fsp of sfas r classification of options and similar instruments issued as employee compensation that allow for cash settlement upon the occurrence of a contingent event 
the guidance in fsp sfas r amends paragraphs and a of sfas no 
r to incorporate the concept articulated in footnote of sfas r 
that is  a cash settlement feature that can be exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is outside the employees control does not meet the condition in paragraphs and a until it becomes probable that the event will occur 
originally under sfas r  a provision in a share based payment plan that required an entity to settle outstanding options in cash upon the occurrence of any contingent event required classification and accounting for the share based payment as a liability 
this caused an issue under certain awards that require or permit  at the holders election  cash settlement of the option or similar instrument upon a a change in control or other liquidity event of the entity or b death or disability of the holder 
with this new fsp  these types of cash settlement features will not require liability accounting so long as the feature can be exercised only upon the occurrence of a contingent event that is outside the employees control such as an initial public offering until it becomes probable that the event will occur 
the guidance in this fsp shall be applied upon initial adoption of sfas r 
an entity that adopted sfas r prior to the issuance of the fsp shall apply the guidance in the fsp in the first reporting period beginning after february early application of fsp fas r is permitted in periods for which

safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements as that term is defined in section e of the securities exchange act of the risk factors described in this report could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted 
by way of example the competitive nature of the same day delivery business 
the ability of the company to attract and retain qualified courier personnel as well as retain key management personnel 
a change in the current tax status of courier drivers from independent contractor drivers to employees 
a significant increase in the number of workers compensation or vehicle liability claims such that the company s self insurance expense would increase significantly 
a significant reduction in the exchange rate between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
failure of the company to maintain required certificates  permits or licenses  or to comply with applicable laws  ordinances or regulations could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of the company s authority to conduct certain of its operations 
the ability of the company to obtain adequate financing 
the ability of the company to pass on fuel cost increases to customers to maintain profit margins and the quality of driver pay 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign exchange exposure significant portions of the company s operations are conducted in canada 
exchange rate fluctuations between the us and canadian dollar result in fluctuations in the amounts relating to the canadian operations reported in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company historically has not entered into hedging transactions with respect to its foreign currency exposure  but may do so in the future 
the sensitivity analysis model used by the company for foreign exchange exposure compares the revenue and net income figures from canadian operations over the previous four quarters at the actual exchange rate versus a decrease in the exchange rate 
based on this model  a decrease would result in a decrease in revenue of approximately million and a decrease in net income of approximately million over this period 
there can be no assurances that the above projected exchange rate decrease will materialize 
fluctuations of exchange rates are beyond the control of the company s management 

table of contents interest rate exposure the company has no interest rate protection arrangements in effect at the present time 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes
