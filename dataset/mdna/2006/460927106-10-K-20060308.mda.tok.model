item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that follows should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report on form k 
intervest bancshares corporation has three wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries intervest national bank  intervest mortgage corporation and intervest securities corporation hereafter referred to collectively as the company on a consolidated basis 
intervest bancshares corporation and intervest national bank may be referred to individually as the holding company and the bank  respectively 
intervest bancshares corporation also has four wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiaries  intervest statutory trust i  ii  iii and iv  which were formed in connection with the issuance of trust preferred securities 
for a discussion of the company s business  see the section entitled item business in this report 
the company s principal revenues are derived from interest  dividends and fees earned on its interest earning assets  which are comprised of mortgage loans  securities and other short term investments 
the company s principal expenses consist of interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities  which are comprised of deposits  debentures and other short term borrowings  and its operating and general expenses 
the company s profitability depends primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income generated from its interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on its interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is dependent upon the interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
the interest rate spread is impacted by interest rates  deposit flows and loan demand 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its noninterest income and expenses  provision for loan losses and income tax expense 
noninterest income consists mostly of loan and other banking fees as well as income from loan prepayments 
when a mortgage loan is repaid prior to maturity  the company may recognize prepayment income  which consists of the recognition of unearned fees associated with such loans at the time of payoff and the receipt of additional prepayment fees and interest in certain cases 
the amount of income from loan prepayments can fluctuate significantly and cannot be predicted 
normally  the number of instances of prepayment of mortgage loans tends to increase during periods of declining interest rates and tends to decrease during periods of increasing interest rates 
many of the company s mortgage loans include provisions relating to prepayment and others prohibit prepayment of indebtedness entirely 
noninterest expense consists of compensation and benefits expense  occupancy and equipment expenses  data processing expenses  advertising expense  professional fees  insurance expense and other operating expenses 
the company s profitability is also significantly affected by general and local economic conditions  competition  changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
nearly all of the company s loan portfolio is concentrated in mortgage loans secured by commercial and multifamily real estate properties including rental and cooperative condominium apartment buildings  office buildings  mix used properties  shopping centers  hotels  restaurants  industrial properties  parking lots garages and vacant land 
these loans have an average life of approximately three years 
the company tends to lend in areas that are in the process of being revitalized  with a concentration of loans on properties located in new york state and the state of florida 
a significant portion of the residential properties are located in new york city and are subject to rent control and rent stabilization laws  which limit the ability of the property owners to increase rents 
all loans are subject to the risk of default  otherwise known as credit risk  which represents the possibility of the company not recovering amounts due from its borrowers 
a borrower s ability to make payments due under a mortgage loan is dependent upon the risks associated with real estate investments in general  including the following general or local economic conditions in the areas the properties are located  neighborhood values  interest rates  real estate tax rates  operating expenses of the mortgaged properties  supply of and demand for rental units  supply of and demand for properties  ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties  zoning laws  governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies 
additionally  terrorist acts and armed conflicts  such as the war on terrorism  and natural disasters  such as hurricanes  may have an adverse impact on economic conditions 
economic conditions affect the market value of the mortgaged properties underlying the company s loans as well as the levels of rent and occupancy of income producing properties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the information included in management s discussion and analysis herein is governed by policies that are based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained in the company s financial statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of the company s transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact its transactions could change 
among the more significant policies of the company are those that govern accounting for loans and the allowance for loan losses 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it is important to a company s results of operations and financial condition  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the financial statements and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that the estimates and assumptions used in connection with the amounts reported in its financial statements and related disclosures are reasonable and made in good faith 
the company believes that currently its only significant critical accounting policy relates to the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period requiring management to make assumptions about future losses on loans 
the impact of a sudden large loss could deplete the allowance and potentially require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which could negatively affect the company s earnings and financial position 
the allowance for loan losses reflects management s judgment as to the estimated losses that may result from defaults in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to operations 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses is evaluated monthly or more frequently when necessary with consideration given to the following factors i the size of the loan portfolio  which continues to experience rapid growth and an increase in individual loan balances  ii the nature of the loan portfolio  which is concentrated on commercial and multifamily real estate properties  including loans on substantially vacant properties and vacant land  all of which are generally considered to have more credit risk than family residential lending because these loans tend to involve larger loan balances to single borrowers and their repayment is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the underlying real estate for income producing properties  while loans on vacant land typically do not have income streams and depend upon other sources of cash flow from the borrower for repayment  iii specific problem loans  including loans on nonaccrual status  and estimates of fair value of the underlying properties  iv historical chargeoffs and recoveries  v adverse situations which may affect the borrowers ability to repay  and vi management s perception of the current and anticipated economic conditions in the company s lending areas  which are concentrated in new york and florida 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions  or other factors  differ from those previously assumed in the determination of the level of the allowance 
for calculation purposes  the allowance for loan losses is comprised of an unallocated portion which is derived from an estimated loss factor currently ranging from to multiplied by the principal amount of loans rated acceptable  and higher percentages for loans that are assigned a credit grade of special mention or lower and  from time to time  an allocated or specific portion on certain loans  particularly for loans that have been identified as being impaired 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
specifies the manner in which the portion of the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is computed 
a loan is normally deemed impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect both full principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment for larger balance loans such as commercial real estate and multifamily loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the observable market price of the loan  or the estimated fair value of the loan s collateral  if payment of the principal and interest is dependent upon the collateral 
when the fair value of the property is less than the recorded investment in the loan  this deficiency is recognized as a valuation allowance within the overall allowance for loan losses and a charge through the provision for loan losses 
the company s policy is to charge off any portion of the recorded investment in the loan that exceeds the fair value of the collateral 
the company considers a variety of factors in determining whether a loan is impaired  including i any notice from the borrower that the borrower will be unable to repay all principal and interest amounts contractually due under the loan agreement  ii any delinquency in the principal and or interest payments other than minimum delays or shortfalls in payments  and iii other information known by management that would indicate the full repayment of principal and interest is not probable 
in evaluating loans for impairment  management generally considers delinquencies of days or less to be minimum delays  and accordingly does not consider such delinquent loans to be impaired in the absence of other indications 
impaired loans normally consist of loans on nonaccrual status 
generally  all loans are evaluated for impairment on a loan by loan basis 
finally  the company s regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  the company may be required to take certain chargeoffs and or recognize additions to the allowance based on the regulators judgment concerning information available to them during their examination

the loan was paid in full and the bank recovered all amounts due thereunder 
with respect to two loans on nonaccual status at december   the borrower declared bankruptcy and the bankruptcy trustee has sold the properties collateralizing the loans 
the proceeds of the sale are sufficient to provide for repayment of the company s recorded investment and the company is taking appropriate action to obtain the proceeds from the bankruptcy trustee 
nonaccrual loans are considered impaired under the criteria of sfas no 
 but no valuation allowance was maintained at any time since the company believes that the estimated fair value of the underlying properties exceeded its recorded investment 
at december  and december   there were no other impaired loans 
at december   there were million of loans ninety days past due and still accruing interest because they were deemed by management to be well secured and in the process of collection 
such amount represented three loans that are past their maturity date  but in each case the borrower continues to make monthly payments of interest and principal 
during january  one loan in the amount of million that was ninety days past due and still accruing was repaid in full 
based upon discussions with the remaining borrowers  it is anticipated that the remaining loans will be repaid in full or refinanced in the near term 
there were no loans ninety days past due and still accruing interest at december  allowance for loan losses at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  compared to million at december  the allowance represented of total loans net of deferred fees outstanding at december  and at december  the increase in the allowance was due to provisions aggregating million during resulting largely from loan growth which amounted to million from december

the services are performed by intervest mortgage corporation s personnel and the related expenses are borne by intervest mortgage corporation 
in addition  from time to time  intervest mortgage corporation has also received capital contributions from the holding company

regulatory capital the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and other bank regulatory agencies use five capital categories ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized to determine various matters  including prompt corrective action and each institution s fdic deposit insurance premiums 
these categories involve quantitative measures of a bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the bank is required to maintain regulatory defined minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based capital ratio levels of at least  and  respectively 
at december  and  management believes the bank met its capital adequacy requirements and is a well capitalized institution as defined in the regulations  which require minimum tier leverage and tier and total risk based ratios of  and  respectively 
management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change the bank s designation as a well capitalized institution 
information regarding the bank s regulatory capital and related ratios is summarized as follows at december  in thousands tier capital   tier capital   total risk based capital   net risk weighted assets   average assets for regulatory purposes   tier capital to average assets tier capital to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets the holding company on a consolidated basis is subject to minimum regulatory capital requirements administered by the frb 
these guidelines require a ratio of tier or core capital  as defined in the guidelines  to total risk weighted assets of at least and a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least 
the guidelines also require a ratio of tier capital to adjusted total average assets of not less than 
at december  and  management believes that the holding company met its capital adequacy requirements 
information regarding the holding company s regulatory capital and related ratios is summarized below at december  in thousands tier capital   tier capital   total risk based capital   net risk weighted assets   average assets for regulatory purposes   tier capital to average assets tier capital to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets there are million of qualifying capital securities outstanding total debentures of million issued to statutory trust i  ii  iii and iv by the holding company less the holding company s investments in those trusts aggregating million 
at december  and december   million and million of those securities  respectively  was included in tier capital  and the remaining portion was included in tier capital 
the inclusion of these securities in tier capital is limited to of core capital elements  as defined in the fdic regulations the federal reserve on march  issued a final rule that retains trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies bhc  but with stricter quantitative limits and clearer qualitative standards 
the new rule provides a transition period for bhcs to meet the new  stricter limitations within regulatory capital by allowing the limits on restricted core capital elements to become fully effective as of march  until march   bhcs generally must comply with the current tier capital limits 
that is  bhcs generally should calculate their tier capital on a basis that limits the aggregate amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities to percent of the sum of qualifying common stockholder s equity  qualifying noncumulative and cumulative perpetual preferred stock including related surplus  qualifying minority interest in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  and qualifying trust preferred securities 
amounts of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities in excess of this limit may be included in tier capital 
beginning march   qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities  as well as certain types of minority interest  are limited to percent of the sum of core capital elements net of goodwill 
the holding company currently does not have any goodwill 
beginning march   the excess amounts of restricted core capital elements in the form of qualifying trust preferred securities included in tier capital are limited to percent of tier capital net of goodwill 
amounts in excess of this limit will still be taken into account in the overall assessment of an organization s funding and financial condition 
the final rule also provides that in the last five years before the underlying subordinated note matures  the associated trust preferred securities must be treated as limited life preferred stock 
thus  in the last five years of the life of the note  the outstanding amount of trust preferred securities will be excluded from tier capital and included in tier capital  subject  together with subordinated debt and other limited life preferred stock  to a limit of percent of tier capital 
during this period  the trust preferred securities will be amortized out of tier capital by one fifth of the original amount less redemptions each year and excluded totally from tier capital during the last year of life of the underlying note 
as of december   assuming the company no longer included its trust preferred securities in tier capital  the company would still exceed the well capitalized threshold under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
intervest securities corporation is subject to the sec s uniform net capital rule which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital of  at december  and  intervest securities corporation s net capital was million 
asset and liability management interest rate risk arises from differences in the repricing of assets and liabilities within a given time period 
the company does not engage in trading or hedging activities  nor does it invest in interest rate derivatives or enter into interest rate swaps 
the primary objective of the company s asset liability management strategy is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on its net interest income and capital 
the company uses gap analysis  which measures the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within a given time period  to monitor its interest rate sensitivity 
an asset or liability is normally considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within one year 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
conversely  a gap is considered negative when the opposite is true 
in a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to increase net interest income 
in a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to increase net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if the repricing of the company s assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates for the following reasons 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  may have features generally referred to in the industry as interest rate caps and floors  which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  asset prepayment and early deposit withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase  and the behavior of depositors may be different than those assumed in the gap analysis 
the company s one year positive interest rate sensitivity gap increased to million  or of total assets  at december   from million  or at december  the increase in the positive gap primarily reflects an increase in loans that reprice or mature within one year funded by time deposits with terms of more than one year 
for purposes of computing the gap  all deposits with no stated maturities are treated as readily accessible accounts 
however  if such deposits were treated differently  the one year gap would then change 
the behavior of core depositors may not necessarily result in the immediate withdrawal of funds in the event deposit rates offered by the bank did not change as quickly and uniformly as changes in general market rates 
for example  if only of deposits with no stated maturity were assumed to be readily accessible  the one year gap would have been a positive at december   compared to a positive at december many of the company s floating rate loans have a floor  or minimum rate  that is determined in relation to prevailing market rates on the date of origination 
this floor only adjusts upwards in the event of increases in the loan s interest rate 
this feature reduces the unfavorable effect on interest income of a falling rate environment because the interest rates on such loans do not reset downward 
however  the company may nonetheless experience loan prepayments  the amount of which cannot be predicted  and reinvestment risk associated with the resulting proceeds 
notwithstanding all of the above  there can be no assurances that a sudden and substantial increase in interest rates may not adversely impact the company s earnings  to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis

fixed rate loans and debentures payable are scheduled  including repayments  according to their contractual maturities 
deferred loan fees are excluded from this analysis 
securities are scheduled according to the earlier of their contractual maturity or the date in which the interest rate is scheduled to increase 
the effects of possible prepayments that may result from the issuer s right to call a security before its contractual maturity date are not considered

recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of this topic 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data concerning the company presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on the performance of the company than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit taking activities  and the issuance of its debentures 
the company has not engaged in and accordingly has no risk related to trading accounts  commodities  interest rate hedges or foreign exchange 
the measurement of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments as of december  and  which reflect changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
management actively monitors and manages the company s interest rate risk exposure 
the primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to limit  within established guidelines  the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital
