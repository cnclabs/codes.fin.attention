item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations 
related to the continuing effects of the storms  in late january  one of our suppliers suffered two boiler failures that resulted in damages to certain of our facilities in jefferson county  texas 
this damage caused unplanned outages and repair costs that we estimate will have a negative impact of approximately million on our results of operations in the first quarter of other than this incident  we do not expect any significant continuing impacts from the us gulf coast storms in we are in the process of preparing claims for possible recovery of damages under our insurance policies for property damage and business interruption resulting from the us gulf coast storms including for the incident discussed above at our jefferson county  texas facility 
while we can provide no assurances that we will recover these damages or the amount of recovery  if any  we anticipate obtaining at least a partial recovery  net of insurance deductibles  by the end of overview we are among the world s largest global manufacturers of differentiated and commodity chemical products 
we manufacture a broad range of chemical products and formulations  which are marketed in more than countries to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers 
our products are used in a wide range of applications  including those in the adhesives  aerospace  automotive  construction products  durable and non durable consumer products  electronics  medical  packaging  paints and coatings  power generation  refining and synthetic fiber industries 
we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines  including mdi  amines  surfactants  epoxy based polymer formulations  maleic anhydride and titanium dioxide 
our administrative  research and development and manufacturing operations are primarily conducted at the facilities that we own or lease 
our facilities are located in countries and we employ approximately  associates worldwide 
our businesses benefit from significant integration  large production scale and proprietary manufacturing technologies  which allow us to maintain a low cost position 
our products and segments our business is organized around our six segments polyurethanes  advanced materials  performance products  pigments  polymers and base chemicals 
these segments can be divided into two broad categories differentiated and commodity 
we produce differentiated products primarily in our polyurethanes  advanced materials and performance products segments 
these products serve diverse end markets and are generally characterized by historical growth in excess of gdp growth  resulting from product substitution and new product development  proprietary manufacturing processes and product formulations and a high degree of customer loyalty 
demand for these products tends to be driven by the value added attributes that they create in our customers end use applications 
while the demand for these differentiated products is also influenced by worldwide economic conditions and gdp growth  our differentiated products have tended to produce more stable profit margins and higher demand growth rates than our commodity products 
in our commodity chemical businesses  we produce titanium dioxide derived from titanium bearing ores in our pigments segment and petrochemical based olefins  aromatics and polyolefins products in our polymers and base chemicals segments 
since the coatings industry consumes a substantial portion of titanium dioxide production  seasonal demand patterns in the coatings industry drive the profitability of our pigments segment  profitability is also driven by industry wide operating rates  with a lag of up to twelve months due to the effects of stocking and destocking by customers and suppliers 
the profitability of our polymers and base chemicals segments has historically been cyclical in nature 
the industry has recently operated in an up cycle that resulted primarily from strong demand reflecting global economic conditions and the fact that there have been no recent north american or european capacity additions 
however  volatile crude oil and natural gas based raw materials costs and a recent weakening in demand could negatively impact the future profitability of our polymers and base chemicals segments 
graphic percentage allocations in the segment revenues chart above reflect the allocation of all inter segment revenue eliminations to our base chemicals segment 
percentage allocations in the segment ebitda chart above do not give effect to million of corporate and other unallocated items and exclude million of restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs

polyurethanes general we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of polyurethane chemicals  including mdi  po  polyols  pg and tpu 
polyurethane chemicals are used to produce rigid and flexible foams  as well as coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers 
we focus on the higher margin  higher growth markets for mdi and mdi based polyurethane systems 
growth in our polyurethanes segment has been driven primarily by the continued substitution of mdi based products for other materials across a broad range of applications 
we operate four primary polyurethanes manufacturing facilities in the us and europe 
we also operate polyurethanes formulation facilities  which are located in close proximity to our customers worldwide 
we have a significant interest in a manufacturing joint venture that has recently begun construction of a low cost  world scale  integrated mdi production facility near shanghai  china 
we expect production at this facility to commence in our customers produce polyurethane products through the combination of an isocyanate  such as mdi or tdi  with polyols  which are derived largely from po and eo 
while the range of tdi based products is relatively limited  we are able to produce over  distinct mdi based polyurethane products by varying the proportion and type of polyol used and by introducing other chemical additives to our mdi formulations 
as a result  polyurethane products  especially those derived from mdi  are continuing to replace traditional products in a wide range of end use markets  including insulation in construction and appliances  cushioning for automotive and furniture  adhesives  wood binders  footwear and other specialized engineering applications 
we are a leading north american producer of po 
we and some of our customers process po into derivative products such as polyols for polyurethane products  pg and various other chemical products 
end uses for these derivative products include applications in the home furnishings  construction  appliance  packaging  automotive and transportation  food  paints and coatings and cleaning products industries 
we also produce mtbe as a co product of our po manufacturing process 
mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
see environmental  health and safety matters mtbe developments below and item a 
risk factors for a discussion of legal and regulatory developments that have resulted in the curtailment and potential elimination of mtbe in gasoline in the us and elsewhere 
also see  manufacturing and operations below and part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of material changes concerning sales of mtbe 
we have announced the sale of our us butadiene and mtbe business operated in our base chemicals segment  however  the po mtbe operations in our polyurethanes segment are not included in this transaction which is expected to close in mid see recent developments pending sale of us butadiene and mtbe business above 
in  we were the first global supplier of polyurethane chemicals to open a technical service center in china 
we have since expanded this facility to include an integrated polyurethanes formulation facility 
in january  we entered into two related joint ventures to build mdi production facilities near shanghai  china 
our mdi joint ventures will enable us to strengthen our long standing presence in china and to further capitalize on the growth in demand for mdi in asia 
products and markets mdi is used primarily in rigid foam applications and in a wide variety of customized higher value flexible foam and coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers 
polyols  including polyether and polyester polyols  are used in conjunction with mdi and tdi in rigid foam  flexible foam and other non foam applications 
po is one of the principal raw materials for producing polyether polyols 
the following chart illustrates the range of product types and end uses for polyurethane chemicals 
graphic polyurethane chemicals are sold to customers who combine the chemicals to produce polyurethane products 
depending on their needs  customers will use either commodity polyurethane chemicals produced for mass sales or polyurethane systems tailored for their specific requirements 
by varying the blend  additives and specifications of the polyurethane chemicals  manufacturers are able to develop and produce a breadth and variety of polyurethane products 
mdi 
mdi has a substantially larger market size and a higher growth rate than tdi 
this is primarily because mdi can be used to make polyurethanes with a broader range of properties and can therefore be used in a wider range of applications than tdi 
we believe that future growth of mdi is expected to be driven by the continued substitution of mdi based polyurethane for fiberglass and other materials currently used in rigid insulation foam for construction 
we expect that other markets  such as binders for reconstituted wood board products  specialty cushioning applications and coatings will further contribute to the continued growth of mdi 
the us and european markets currently consume the largest quantities of mdi 
with the recent rapid growth of the developing asian economies  the asian markets are becoming an increasingly important market for mdi  and we currently believe that per capita demand for mdi in asia will continue to increase as its less developed economies continue to grow 
there are four major global producers of mdi bayer  our company  basf and dow 
we believe it is unlikely that any new global producers of mdi will emerge in the foreseeable future due to the substantial requirements for entry such as the limited availability of licenses for mdi technology and the substantial capital commitment and integration that is required to develop both the necessary technology and the infrastructure to manufacture and market mdi 
tpu 
tpu is a high quality fully formulated thermal plastic derived from the reaction of mdi or an aliphatic isocyanate with polyols to produce unique qualities such as durability  flexibility  strength  abrasion resistance  shock absorbency and chemical resistance 
we can tailor the performance characteristics of tpu to meet the specific requirements of our customers 
tpu is used in injection molding and small components for the automotive and footwear industries 
it is also extruded into films  wires and cables for use in a wide variety of applications in the coatings  adhesives  sealants and elastomers markets 
polyols 
polyols are combined with mdi  tdi and other isocyanates to create a broad spectrum of polyurethane products 
demand for specialty polyols has been growing at approximately the same rate at which mdi consumption has grown 
aniline 
aniline is an intermediate chemical used primarily to manufacture mdi 
generally  most aniline is either consumed internally by the producers of the aniline or is sold to third parties under long term supply contracts 
we believe that the lack of a significant spot market for aniline means that in order to remain competitive  mdi manufacturers must either be integrated with an aniline manufacturing facility or have a long term cost competitive aniline supply contract 
po 
po is an intermediate chemical used mainly to produce a wide range of polyols and pg 
demand for po depends largely on overall economic demand  especially that of consumer durables 
the following chart illustrates the primary end markets and applications for po 
graphic mtbe 
we currently use our entire production of tba  a co product of our po production process  to produce mtbe 
mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
historically  the refining industry utilized tetra ethyl lead as the primary additive to increase the octane rating of gasoline until health concerns resulted in the removal of tetra ethyl lead from gasoline 
this led to the increasing use of mtbe as a component in gasoline during the s 
mtbe has experienced historical growth due to its ability to satisfy the oxygenation requirement of amendments to the clean air act of the clean air act with respect to exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions from automobile engines 
some regions of the us adopted this oxygenate requirement to improve air quality even though they were not mandated to do so by the clean air act 
the use of mtbe is controversial in the us and elsewhere and has been curtailed and may be eliminated in the future by legislation or regulatory action 
see environmental  health and safety matters mtbe developments below and item a 
risk factors for a further discussion of legal and regulatory developments that have resulted in the curtailment and potential elimination of mtbe in gasoline in the us and elsewhere 
also see  manufacturing and operations below and part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of material changes concerning sales of mtbe 
we have announced the sale of our us butadiene and mtbe business operated in our base chemicals segment  however  the po mtbe operations in our polyurethanes segment are not included in this transaction which is expected to close in mid see recent developments pending sale of us butadiene and mtbe business above 
sales and marketing we manage a global sales force  with locations in countries  which sells our polyurethane chemicals to over  customers in more than countries 
our sales and technical resources are organized to support major regional markets  as well as key end use markets which require a more global approach 
these key end use markets include the appliance  automotive  footwear  furniture and coatings  construction products  adhesives  sealants and elastomers industries 
we provide a wide variety of polyurethane solutions as components ie  the isocyanate or the polyol or in the form of systems in which we provide the total isocyanate and polyol formulation to our customers in ready to use form 
our ability to deliver a range of polyurethane solutions and technical support tailored to meet our customers needs is critical to our long term success 
we have strategically located our polyurethane formulation facilities  commonly referred to in the chemicals industry as systems houses  close to our customers  enabling us to focus on customer support and technical service 
we believe this customer support and technical service system contributes to customer retention and also provides opportunities for identifying further product and service needs of customers 
we manufacture polyols primarily to support our mdi customers requirements 
we believe that the extensive market knowledge and industry experience of our sales teams and technical experts  in combination with our strong emphasis on customer relationships  have facilitated our ability to establish and maintain long term customer supply positions 
due to the specialized nature of our markets  our sales force must possess technical knowledge of our products and their applications 
our strategy is to continue to increase sales to existing customers and to attract new customers by providing innovative solutions  quality products  reliable supply  competitive prices and superior customer service 
manufacturing and operations our mdi production facilities are located in geismar  louisiana and rozenburg  netherlands 
these facilities receive aniline  which is a primary material used in the production of mdi  from our facilities located in geismar  louisiana and wilton  uk we believe that this relative scale and product integration of our large facilities provide a significant competitive advantage over other producers 
in addition to reducing transportation costs for our raw materials  integration helps reduce our exposure to cyclical prices 
the following table sets forth the annual production capacity of polyurethane chemicals at each of our polyurethanes facilities mdi polyols tpu aniline nitrobenzene po pg mtbe millions of pounds geismar  louisiana port neches  texas ringwood  illinois rozenburg  netherlands wilton  uk osnabr ck  germany total    the po mtbe operations in our polyurethanes segment are not included in the announced sale of our us butadiene and mtbe business operated in our base chemicals segment 
see recent developments pending sale of us butadiene and mtbe business above 
millions of gallons 
represents our approximately share of capacity under our rubicon llc manufacturing joint venture with chemtura corporation 
at both our geismar and rozenburg facilities we utilize sophisticated proprietary technology to produce our mdi 
this technology  which will be used in our world scale joint venture in shanghai  china  contributes to our position as a low cost mdi producer 
in addition to mdi  we use a proprietary manufacturing process to manufacture po 
we own or license all technology  know how and patents developed and utilized at our po facility 
our process combines isobutane and oxygen in proprietary oxidation peroxidation reactors  thereby forming tbhp and tba  which are further processed into po and mtbe  respectively 
because our po production process is less expensive relative to other technologies and allows all of our po co products to be processed into saleable or useable materials  we believe that our po production technology possesses several distinct advantages over its alternatives 
we also operate polyurethane systems houses in deerpark  australia  shanghai  china  cartagena  colombia  deggendorf  germany  thane maharashtra  india  ternate  italy  tlalnepantla  mexico  mississauga  ontario  kuan yin  taiwan  and samuprakam  thailand 
in  we marketed approximately of our mtbe to customers located in the us for use as a gasoline additive 
most of our sales of mtbe to us customers were made pursuant to long term agreements 
during and concluding by the first quarter of  our long term mtbe sales agreements will terminate 
we anticipate that our sales of mtbe in the us will decrease substantially as compared to levels 
nevertheless  we expect to continue to sell a portion of our mtbe into the us market  although not pursuant to any new long term agreements 
we have entered into sales agreements to sell a significant percentage of our mtbe into the latin american market  and we currently believe that we could also sell mtbe relatively efficiently in europe and asia 
nevertheless  as a result of varying market prices and transportation costs  sales of mtbe in markets outside the us may produce lower margins than the sale of mtbe in the us we may also elect to use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe 
if we opt to produce products other than mtbe  necessary modifications to our facilities will require us to make significant capital expenditures and the sale of such other products may produce a lower level of cash flow than the sale of mtbe 
joint ventures rubicon joint venture 
we and chemtura corporation own rubicon llc  which owns aniline  nitrobenzene and dpa manufacturing facilities in geismar  louisiana 
we are entitled to approximately of the nitrobenzene and aniline production capacity of rubicon llc  and chemtura corporation is entitled to of the dpa production 
in addition to operating the joint venture s owned aniline  nitrobenzene and dpa facilities  rubicon llc also operates our wholly owned mdi and polyol facilities at geismar and is responsible for providing other auxiliary services to the entire geismar complex 
as a result of this joint venture  we are able to achieve greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would otherwise have been able to obtain 
we began consolidating rubicon llc in our financial statements as of january  chinese mdi joint ventures 
in january  hi entered into two related joint venture agreements to build mdi production facilities near shanghai  china 
shanghai isocyanate investment bv slic  our manufacturing joint venture with basf ag and three chinese chemical companies  will build three plants to manufacture mnb  aniline and crude mdi 
we effectively own of slic and it is our unconsolidated affiliate 
huntsman polyurethanes shanghai ltd 
hps  our splitting joint venture with shanghai chlor alkali chemical company  ltd  will build a plant to manufacture pure mdi  polymeric mdi and mdi variants 
we own of hps and it is our consolidated affiliate 
these projects have been funded by a combination of equity invested by the joint venture partners and borrowed funds 
at project completion  our equity investment in the joint ventures will be approximately million  of which approximately million will be an investment in our unconsolidated affiliate  slic  and approximately million will be an investment in our consolidated affiliate  hps 
in february  we made our final equity investments in slic and hps 
we expect that total capital expenditures at hps through project completion will total approximately million 
we expect to commence operations of slic and hps early in the third quarter of the production capacity of the slic facilities is expected to be million pounds per year of mdi and the production capacity of the hps facility is expected to be million pounds per year of pure mdi  polymeric mdi and mdi variants 
raw materials the primary raw materials for mdi based polyurethane chemicals are benzene and po 
benzene is a widely available commodity that is the primary feedstock for the production of mdi and aniline 
historically  benzene has been the largest component of our raw material costs 
we use the benzene produced in our base chemicals segment and purchase benzene from third parties to manufacture nitrobenzene and aniline  almost all of which we then use to produce mdi 
our vertical integration provides us with a competitively priced supply of feedstocks and reduces our exposure to supply interruption 
a major cost in the production of polyols is attributable to the costs of po 
the integration of our po business with our polyurethane chemicals business gives us access to a competitively priced  strategic source of po and the opportunity to develop polyols that enhance our range of mdi products 
the primary raw materials used in our po production process are butane isobutane  propylene  methanol and oxygen  which accounted for   and  respectively  of total raw material costs in we purchase our raw materials primarily under long term contracts 
while most of these feedstocks are commodity materials generally available to us from a wide variety of suppliers at competitive prices in the spot market  all the propylene used in the production of our po is produced internally and delivered through a pipeline connected to our po facility 
competition our competition in the polyurethane chemicals market includes basf  bayer  dow and lyondell 
while these competitors and others produce various types and quantities of polyurethane chemicals  we focus on mdi and mdi based polyurethane systems 
we compete based on technological innovation  technical assistance  customer service and product reliability 
our polyurethane chemicals business competes in two basic ways where price is the dominant element of competition  our polyurethane chemicals business differentiates itself by its high level of customer support including cooperation on technical and safety matters  and elsewhere  we compete on the basis of product performance and our ability to react quickly to changing customer needs and by providing customers with innovative solutions to their needs 
advanced materials general we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of technologically advanced epoxy  acrylic and polyurethane based polymer products 
we focus on formulations and systems that are used to address customer specific needs in a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications

soldermasks are our most important product line in printed circuit board technologies  particularly in europe 
sales are made mainly under the probimer  probimage  and probelec trademarks 
probimer is a widely recognized brand name for soldermasks 
design and composites engineering 
a structural composite is made by combining two or more different materials  such as fibers  resins and other specialty additives to create a product with enhanced structural properties 
specifically  structural composites are lightweight  high strength  rigid materials with high resistance to chemicals  moisture and high temperatures 
our product range comprises basic and advanced epoxy resins  curing agents  other advanced chemicals and additives or formulated polymer systems utilizing a variety of these products used in reinforced structures 
the four key target markets for our structural composites are aerospace  windmill blades for wind power generation  other industrial and automotive applications  and recreational mainly sports equipment such as skis and tennis racquets 
structural composites continue to substitute for traditional materials  such as metals and wood  in a wide variety of applications due to their light weight  strength and durability 
a key industry trend is the increased emphasis on customer collaboration  especially in the aerospace industry  where consistent quality of products is essential 
customers are increasingly seeking higher performance characteristics such as improved temperature resistance 
we also produce industry specific adhesives for aerospace  wind turbines and industrial applications 
these products offer superior bonding properties as compared to other joining techniques 
we produce mainly polyurethane based and epoxy formulated polymer systems used in the production of models  prototypes  patterns  molds and a variety of related products for design  prototyping and short run manufacture 
our products are used extensively in the automotive  aerospace and industrial markets as productivity tools to quickly and efficiently create accurate prototypes and develop experimental models  and to lower the cost of manufacturing items in limited quantities primarily using computer aided design techniques 
our tooling and modeling materials are used because of their strength  resilience  high temperature resistance or dimensional stability coupled with low shrinkage and ease of cure 
in applications where ease and speed of processing  size of finished product and low abrasion are more important  polyurethane resins are gaining increasing recognition 
we separate the overall tooling and modeling materials market into two distinct groups standard tooling and modeling materials and stereolithography technology 
our standard tooling and modeling materials are polymer based materials used by craftsmen to make the traditional patterns  molds  models  jigs and fixtures required by the foundry  automotive  ceramics and other such industries

we sell our stereolithography products to customers in the aerospace  appliance  automotive  consumer  electronics and medical markets 
sales and marketing we maintain multiple routes to market to service our diverse customer base 
these routes to market range from using our own direct sales force to targeted  technically oriented distribution to mass general distribution 
our direct sales force targets sales and specifications to engineering solutions decision makers at major customers who purchase significant amounts of products from us 
we use technically oriented specialist distributors to augment our sales effort in niche markets and applications where we do not believe it is appropriate to develop direct sales resources 
we use mass general distribution channels to sell our products into a wide range of general applications where technical expertise is less important to the user of the products to reduce our overall selling expenses 
we believe our use of multiple routes to market enables us to reach a broader customer base at an efficient cost 
we conduct the sales activities for our market groups through separate dedicated regional sales forces in the americas  europe  africa and the middle east eame and asia 
our global customers are covered by key account managers who are familiar with the specific requirements of their clients 
the management of long standing customer relationships  some of which are to years old  is at the heart of the sales and marketing process 
we are also supported by a strong network of distributors 
we serve a highly fragmented customer base 
for our consumer adhesives  we have entered into exclusive branding and distribution arrangements with  for example  bostik in europe and shelleys in australia 
under these arrangements  our distribution partners fund advertising and sales promotions  negotiate and sell to major retail chains  own inventories and provide store deliveries and sometimes shelf merchandising in exchange for a reliable  high quality supply of araldite branded  ready to sell packaged products

we also purchase amines  polyols  isocyanates  acrylic materials  hardeners and fillers for the production of our formulated polymer systems and complex chemicals and additives 
raw material costs constitute a sizeable percentage of sales for certain applications 
we have supply contracts with a number of suppliers  including  for example  dow 
the terms of our supply contracts vary 
in general  these contracts contain provisions that set forth the quantities of product to be supplied and purchased and formula based pricing 
additionally  we produce some of our most important raw materials  such as blr and its basic derivatives  which are the basic building blocks of many of our products 
we are the third largest producer of blr in the world 
approximately of the blr we produce is consumed in the production of our formulated polymer systems 
the balance of our blr is sold as liquid or solid resin in the merchant market  allowing us to increase the utilization of our production plants and lower our overall blr production cost 
we believe that manufacturing a substantial proportion of our principal raw material gives us a competitive advantage over other epoxy based polymer systems formulators  most of whom must buy blr from third party suppliers 
this position helps protect us from pricing pressure from blr suppliers and aids in providing us a stable supply of blr in difficult market conditions 
we consume certain amines produced by our performance products segment and isocyanates produced by our polyurethanes segment  which we use to formulate advanced materials products 
in some cases  we use tolling arrangements with third parties to convert our base chemicals products into certain of our key raw materials

competition in stereolithography is driven by the requirement for innovative solutions 
we believe that our competitive strength is our broad range of products  which we make available on a global basis  covering all of the needs of both our standard tooling and modeling and stereolithography customers 
a few large manufacturers including axson  dsm and sika  as well as many small  local manufacturers provide a limited product range to local regions in the plastic tooling and modeling solutions market but none have our breadth of product offering 
performance products general our performance products segment is organized around three market groups  performance specialties  performance intermediates  and maleic anhydride and licensing  and serves a wide variety of consumer and industrial end markets 
in performance specialties  we are a leading global producer of amines  carbonates and certain specialty surfactants 
growth in demand in our performance specialties market tends to be driven by the end performance characteristics that our products deliver to our customers 
these products are manufactured for use in a growing number of niche industrial end uses and have been characterized by growing demand and stable profitability 
for example  we are one of two significant global producers of polyetheramines  for which our sales volumes have grown at a compound annual rate of over in the last ten years due to strong demand in a number of industrial applications  such as epoxy curing agents  agrochemicals  fuel additives and civil construction materials 
in performance intermediates  we consume internally produced and third party sourced base petrochemicals in the manufacture of our surfactants  lab and ethanolamines products  which are primarily used in detergent and consumer products applications 
we also produce eg  which is primarily used in the production of polyester fibers and pet packaging  and eo  all of which is consumed internally in the production of our downstream products

these products are manufactured at our port neches  conroe and freeport  texas facilities and at our facilities in llanelli  uk and petfurdo  hungary 
we use internally produced ethylene  eo  eg and po in the manufacture of many of our amines 
our amines are used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial applications  including personal care products  polyurethane foam  fuel and lubricant additives  paints and coatings  solvents and catalysts 
our key amines customers include akzo  chevrontexaco  cognis  hercules  monsanto and ppg 
we have the capacity to produce approximately billion pounds of surfactant products annually at our facilities located in north america  europe and australia 
we are a leading global manufacturer of nonionic  anionic  cationic and amphotenic surfactants products and are characterized by our breadth of product offering and market coverage 
our surfactant products are primarily used in consumer detergent and industrial cleaning applications 
in addition  we manufacture and market a diversified range of mild surfactants and specialty formulations for use in baby shampoos and other personal care applications 
we are also a leading european producer of powder and liquid laundry detergents and other cleaners 
in addition  we offer a wide range of surfactants and formulated specialty products for use in various industrial applications such as leather and textile treatment  foundry and construction  agrochemicals  polymers and coatings 
our key surfactants customers include ecolab  huish  l oreal  monsanto  nufarm  procter gamble and unilever 
we are north america s second largest producer of lab  with capacity of million pounds per year at our plant in chocolate bayou  texas 
lab is a surfactant intermediate which is converted into las  a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer  industrial and institutional laundry detergents

products and markets performance specialties 
the following table shows the end market applications for our performance specialties products product group applications specialty amines liquid soaps  personal care  lubricant and fuel additives  polyurethane foams  fabric softeners  paints and coatings  refinery processing  water treating polyetheramines polyurethane foams and insulation  construction and flooring  paints and coatings  lubricant and fuel additives  adhesives ethyleneamines lubricant and fuel additives  epoxy hardeners  wet strength resins  chelating agents  fungicides morpholine dga agent and gas treating hydrocarbon processing  construction chemicals  synthetic rubber  water treating  electronics applications  gas treatment and agriculture carbonates lubricant and fuel additives  agriculture  electronics applications  textile treatment specialty surfactants agricultural herbicides  construction  paper de inking our performance specialties products are organized around the following end markets coatings  polymers and resins  process additives  resources  fuels and lubricants  and agrochemicals 
amines 
amines broadly refers to the family of intermediate chemicals that are produced by reacting ammonia with various ethylene and propylene derivatives 
generally  amines are valued for their properties as a reactive  emulsifying  dispersant  detergent  solvent or corrosion inhibiting agent 
growth in demand for amines is highly correlated with gdp growth due to its strong links to general industrial and consumer products markets 
however  certain segments of the amines market  such as polyetheramines  have grown at rates well in excess of gdp growth due to new product development  technical innovation  and substitution and replacement of competing products 
for example  polyetheramines are used by customers who demand increasingly sophisticated performance characteristics as an additive in the manufacture of highly customized epoxy formulations  enabling the customers to penetrate new markets and substitute for traditional curing materials 
as amines are generally sold based upon the performance characteristics that they provide to customer specific end use application  pricing does not generally fluctuate with movements in underlying raw materials 
we announced on september  our plans to build a world scale polyetheramine manufacturing facility in jurong island  singapore 
we expect the facility  which will have an annual capacity of approximately million pounds  to be operational in the first quarter of we also announced on june  that we had signed a memorandum of understanding with the al zamil group of riyadh  saudi arabia to form a joint venture to build a million pound ethyleneamines manufacturing facility in jubail industrial city  saudi arabia 
we expect this facility to come on line in late morpholine dga agent 
morpholine and dga agent are produced as co products by reacting ammonia with deg 
morpholine is used in a number of niche industrial applications including rubber curing as an accelerator and flocculants for water treatment 
dga agent is primarily used in gas treating  electronics  herbicides and metalworking end use applications 
carbonates 
ethylene and propylene carbonates are manufactured by reacting eo and po with carbon dioxide 
carbonates are used as solvents and as reactive diluents in polymer and coating applications 
they are also increasingly being used as a photo resist solvent in the manufacture of printed circuit boards and the production of lithium batteries 
also  propylene carbonates have recently received epa approval for use as a solvent in certain agricultural applications 
we expect these solvents to replace traditional aromatic solvents that are increasingly subject to legislative restrictions and prohibitions 
performance intermediates 
the following table sets forth the end markets for our performance intermediates products product group end markets surfactants alkoxylates household detergents  industrial cleaners  anti fog chemicals for glass  asphalt emulsions  shampoos  polymerization additives  de emulsifiers for petroleum production sulfonates sulfates powdered detergents  liquid detergents  shampoos  body washes  dishwashing liquids  industrial cleaners  emulsion polymerization  concrete superplasticizers  gypsum wallboard esters and derivatives shampoo  body wash  textile and leather treatment nitrogen derivatives bleach thickeners  baby shampoo  fabric conditioners  other personal care products formulated blends household detergents  textile and leather treatment  personal care products  pharmaceutical intermediates eo po block co polymers automatic dishwasher detergents ethanolamines wood preservatives  herbicides  construction  gas treatment  metalworking lab consumer detergents  industrial and institutional detergents  synthetic lubricants eg polyester fibers and pet bottle resins  antifreeze surfactants 
surfactants or surface active agents are substances that combine a water soluble component with a water insoluble component in the same molecule 
while surfactants are most commonly used for their detergency in cleaning applications  they are also valued for their emulsification  foaming  dispersing  penetrating and wetting properties in a variety of industries 
demand growth for surfactants is relatively stable and exhibits little cyclicality 
the main consumer product applications for surfactants can demand new formulations with unproved performance characteristics  and as a result life cycles for these consumer end products can often be quite short 
this affords considerable opportunity for innovative surfactants manufacturers like us to provide surfactants and blends with differentiated specifications and properties 
for basic surfactants  pricing tends to have a strong relationship to underlying raw material prices and usually lags petrochemical price movements 
however  pricing in recent years has also been adversely affected by the growing purchasing power of soapers  such as procter gamble and unilever 
the big box stores  such as wal mart and costco have also placed pricing pressure along the surfactant value chain 
ethanolamines 
ethanolamines are a range of chemicals produced by the reaction of eo with ammonia 
they are used as intermediates in the production of a variety of industrial  agricultural and consumer products 
there are a limited number of competitors due to the technical and cost barriers to entry 
growth in this sector has typically been higher than gdp and in the last few years has benefited in particular from the conversion to ethanolamines in the formulation of wood treatment products 
we believe the ethanolamines market in north america is tight with industry operating rates currently running in excess of of stated capacity 
we announced on april  our intention to expand the manufacturing capacity of our port neches  texas facility by million pounds per year to come on line during the second half of some of our competitors have announced their intention to debottleneck their facilities to meet the continuing growing demand for ethanolamines 
lab 
lab is a surfactant intermediate which is produced through the reaction of benzene with either normal paraffins or linear alpha olefins 
nearly all the lab produced globally is converted into las  a major anionic surfactant used worldwide for the production of consumer  industrial and institutional laundry detergents 
four major manufacturers lead the traditional detergency market for lab in north america procter gamble  henkel  unilever and colgate palmolive 
we believe that two thirds of the capacity lies in the hands of seven producers  with two or three major players in each of the three regional markets 
although the north american market for lab is mature  we expect the south american market to grow as detergent demand grows at a faster rate than in more developed countries 
we expect any excess lab capacity in north america to be sold into the growing south american markets 
from a competition perspective  compounds derived from alcohol and its derivatives can be used in place of lab in certain detergent formulations 
in the past several years  a significant amount of new alcohol production capacity has come on stream resulting in lower prices for these alcohol based compounds 
as a result  lab has become less attractive to buyers who have the option to formulate their products with either of these two raw materials  and as a result  margins for lab producers have come under pressure 
eg 
we consume our internally produced eo to produce three types of eg meg  deg and teg 
meg is consumed primarily in the polyester fiber and bottle resin and antifreeze end markets 
eg is also used in a wide variety of industrial applications including synthetic lubricants  plasticizers  solvents and emulsifiers 
maleic anhydride and licensing 
the following table sets forth the end markets for our maleic anhydride products product group end markets maleic anhydride boat hulls  automotive  construction  lubricant and fuel additives  countertops  agrochemicals  paper  and food additives maleic anhydride catalyst and technology licensing maleic anhydride and bdo manufacturers maleic anhydride is a chemical intermediate that is produced by oxidizing either benzene or normal butane through the use of a catalyst 
the largest use of maleic anhydride in the us is in the production of uprs  which we believe account for approximately of us maleic anhydride demand 
upr is the main ingredient in fiberglass reinforced resins  which are used for marine and automotive applications and commercial  and residential construction products 
our maleic anhydride technology is a proprietary fixed bed process with solvent recovery and is characterized by low butane consumption and an energy efficient  high percentage recovery solvent recovery system 
this process competes against two other processes  the fluid bed process and the fixed bed process with water recovery 
we believe that our process is superior in the areas of feedstock and energy efficiency and solvent recovery 
the maleic anhydride based route to bdo manufacture is currently the preferred process technology and is favored over the other routes  which include po  butadiene and acetylene as feedstocks 
as a result  the growth in demand for bdo has resulted in increased demand for our maleic anhydride technology 
total us demand for maleic anhydride is approximately million pounds 
over time  demand for maleic anhydride has generally grown at rates that slightly exceed gdp growth 
however  given its dependence on the upr market  which is heavily influenced by construction end markets  demand can be cyclical 
pricing for maleic anhydride in north america over the past several years has been stable 
generally  changes in price have resulted from changes in industry capacity utilization as opposed to changes in underlying raw material costs 
however  in late we began to link our pricing to the upward movement in the cost of our primary raw material  butane 
we announced on february  that we propose to build a new million pounds per year maleic anhydride facility at our geismar  louisiana site 
we expect the new facility to come on stream during the third quarter of we announced on march  that we created a commercial licensing group responsible for licensing all of our technologies 
sales and marketing we sell over  products to over  customers globally through our performance products marketing group  which has extensive market knowledge  considerable chemical industry experience and well established customer relationships 
our performance specialties markets are organized around end use market applications  such as coatings  polymers and resins and agrochemical 
in these end uses  our marketing efforts are focused on how our product offerings perform in certain customer applications 
we believe that this approach enhances the value of our product offerings and creates opportunities for on going differentiation in our development activities with our customers 
our performance intermediates and maleic anhydride markets organize their marketing efforts around their products and geographic regions served 
we also provide extensive pre and post sales technical service support to our customers where our technical service professionals work closely with our research and development functions to tailor our product offerings to meet our customers unique and changing requirements 
finally  these technical service professionals interact closely with our market managers and business leadership teams to help guide future offerings and market approach strategies 
in addition to our focused direct sales efforts  we maintain an extensive global network of distributors and agents that also sell our products 
these distributors and agents typically promote our products to smaller end use customers who cannot cost effectively be served by our direct sales forces 
manufacturing and operations our performance products segment has the capacity to produce approximately billion pounds annually of a wide variety of specialty  intermediate and commodity products and formulations at manufacturing locations in north america  europe and australia 
these production capacities are as follows current capacity product area north america europe australia total millions of pounds performance specialties amines specialty surfactants carbonates performance intermediates eo   eg surfactants   ethanolamines lab maleic anhydride includes up to million pounds of ethyleneamines that are made available from dow s terneuzen  netherlands facility by way of a long term tolling arrangement 
represents total capacity of a facility owned by sasol huntsman gmbh co 
kg  of which we own a interest and sasol owns the remaining interest 
our surfactants and amines facilities are located globally  with broad capabilities in amination  sulfonation and ethoxylation 
these facilities have a competitive cost base and use modern manufacturing units that allow for flexibility in production capabilities and technical innovation 
our primary eo  eg and ethanolamines facilities are located in port neches  texas and adjacent to the olefins facility operated by our base chemicals segment  which results in a stable  cost effective source of raw material for these ethylene derivatives 
the port neches  texas facility also benefits from extensive logistics infrastructure  which allows for efficient sourcing of other raw materials and distribution of finished products 
our lab facility in chocolate bayou  texas and our maleic anhydride facility in pensacola  florida are both located within large  integrated petrochemical manufacturing complexes operated by solutia 
we believe this results in greater scale and lower costs for our products than we would be able to obtain if these facilities were stand alone operations 
we have restructured our european surfactants operations over the last months 
when this activity is complete in the first quarter of  we will have reduced the workforce by approximately employees 
we have significantly downsized our whitehaven  uk manufacturing facility  consolidated our european drying capacity in castiglione  italy and streamlined our administrative and site support activities across all of our european facilities 
we also closed our guelph  ontario surfactants facility during and transferred the manufacture of key products to other facilities in north america 
raw materials we currently use approximately million pounds of ethylene produced each year at our port arthur and port neches  texas facilities in the production of eo and ethyleneamines 
we consume all of our eo in the manufacture of our eg  surfactants and amines products 
we also use internally produced po and deg in the manufacture of these products 
in addition to internally produced raw materials  our performance specialties market purchases over compounds in varying quantities  the largest of which includes ethylene dichloride  caustic soda  synthetic alcohols  paraffin  nonyl phenol  ammonia  methylamines and acrylonitrile 
the majority of these raw materials are available from multiple sources in the merchant market at competitive prices 
in our performance intermediates market  our primary raw materials  in addition to internally produced and third party sourced eo  are synthetic and natural alcohols  paraffin  benzene and nonyl phenol 
all of these raw materials are widely available in the merchant market at competitive prices 
maleic anhydride is produced by the reaction of n butane with oxygen using our proprietary catalyst 
the principal raw material is n butane which is purchased pursuant to long term contracts and delivered to our pensacola  florida site by barge 
our maleic anhydride catalyst is toll manufactured by engelhard under a long term contract according to our proprietary methods 
competition in our performance specialties market  there are few competitors for many of our products due to the considerable customization of product formulations  the proprietary nature of many of our product applications and manufacturing processes and the relatively high research and development and technical costs involved 
some of our global competitors include basf  air products  dow and akzo 
we compete primarily on the basis of product performance  new product innovation and  to a lesser extent  on the basis of price 
there are numerous global producers of many of our performance intermediates products 
our main competitors include global companies such as dow  sasol  basf  petresa  equistar  shell  cognis  stepan and kao  as well as various smaller or more local competitors 
we compete on the basis of price with respect to the majority of our product offerings and  to a lesser degree  on the basis of product availability  performance and service with respect to certain of our more value added products 
in our maleic anhydride market  we compete primarily on the basis of price  customer service and plant location 
our competitors include lanxess  koch  ashland  lonza and basf 
we are the leading global producer of maleic anhydride catalyst 
competitors in our maleic anhydride catalyst market include scientific design and bp 
in our maleic anhydride technology licensing market  our primary competitor is scientific design 
we compete primarily on the basis of technological performance and service 
pigments general we are a leading global manufacturer and marketer of titanium dioxide  which is a white pigment used to impart whiteness  brightness and opacity to products such as paints  plastics  paper  printing inks  fibers and ceramics 
the global titanium dioxide market is characterized by a small number of large  global producers 
we operate eight chloride based and sulfate based titanium dioxide manufacturing facilities located in north america  europe  asia and africa 
we offer an extensive range of products that are sold worldwide to approximately  customers in all major titanium dioxide end markets and geographic regions 
the geographic diversity of our manufacturing facilities allows our pigments segment to service local customers  as well as global customers that require delivery to more than one location 
our diverse customer base includes ampacet  a 
schulman  akzo nobel  atofina  basf  cabot  clariant  ici  jotun and polyone 
our pigments business has an aggregate annual nameplate capacity of approximately  tonnes at our eight production facilities 
five of our titanium dioxide manufacturing plants are located in europe  one is in north america  one is in asia  and one is in south africa 
our north american operation consists of a interest in a manufacturing joint venture with kronos worldwide  inc our pigments segment is focused on improving our competitive position 
in july  we idled  tonnes of nameplate capacity at our umbogintwini  south africa facility  and in november we idled  tonnes of nameplate capacity at our grimsby  uk facility  which together represent about of our total titanium dioxide production capacity 
through these closures and other cost saving measures  we will improve our cost position and enhance our ability to compete in the global marketplace 
our other cost saving measures include the optimization of the geographic distribution of our sales  the consolidation of back office functions and the continued reduction of our fixed and variable costs at each of our manufacturing facilities 
products and markets historically  global titanium dioxide demand growth rates tend to closely track global gdp growth rates 
however  the demand growth rate and its relationship with the gdp growth rate varies by region 
developed markets such as the us and western europe exhibit higher absolute consumption but lower demand growth rates  while emerging markets such as asia exhibit much higher demand growth rates 
the titanium dioxide industry experiences some seasonality in its sales because paint sales generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere  resulting in greater sales volumes during the second and third quarters of the year 
there are two manufacturing processes for the production of titanium dioxide  the sulfate process and the chloride process 
most recent capacity additions have employed the chloride process technology and  currently  we believe that the chloride process accounts for approximately of global production capacity 
however  the global distribution of sulfate and chloride based titanium dioxide capacity varies by region  with the sulfate process being predominant in europe  our primary market 
the chloride process is the predominant process used in north america  and both processes are used in asia 
while most end use applications can use pigments produced by either process  market preferences typically favor products that are locally available 
we believe the chloride and sulfate manufacturing processes compete effectively in the marketplace 
the global titanium dioxide market is characterized by a small number of large global producers 
the titanium dioxide industry currently has five major producers 
titanium dioxide supply has historically kept pace with increases in demand as producers increased capacity through low cost incremental debottlenecks and efficiency improvements 
during periods of low titanium dioxide demand  the industry experiences high stock levels and consequently reduces production to manage working capital 
pricing in the industry is driven primarily by supply demand balance 
the last major greenfield titanium dioxide capacity addition was in based upon current price levels and the long lead times for planning  governmental approvals and construction  we do not expect significant additional greenfield capacity in the near future 
we believe that demand for titanium dioxide decreased approximately during as compared to during the first three quarters of  lower demand led to an excess of supply of titanium dioxide  increasing inventories and motivating producers to lower industry operating rates 
the us gulf coast storms adversely affected the supply of titanium dioxide  predominantly as a result of the damage caused to dupont s delisle facility 
accordingly  at the end of  industry operating rates were high and inventory levels were low 
sales and marketing approximately of our titanium dioxide sales are made through our direct sales and technical services network  enabling us to cooperate more closely with our customers and to respond to our increasingly global customer base 
our concentrated sales effort and local manufacturing presence have allowed us to achieve our leading market shares in a number of the countries where we manufacture titanium dioxide 
in addition  we have focused on marketing products to higher growth industries 
for example  we believe that our pigments business is well positioned to benefit from the projected growth in the plastics sector which we expect to grow faster than the overall titanium dioxide market over the next several years 
manufacturing and operations our pigments business has eight manufacturing sites in seven countries with a total capacity of approximately  tonnes per year 
approximately of our titanium dioxide capacity is located in western europe 
the following table presents information regarding our titanium dioxide facilities region site annual capacity process tonnes western europe greatham  uk  chloride calais  france  sulfate huelva  spain  sulfate scarlino  italy  sulfate grimsby  uk  sulfate north america lake charles  louisiana  chloride asia teluk kalung  malaysia  sulfate southern africa umbogintwini  south africa  sulfate total  this facility is owned and operated by louisiana pigment company  lp  a manufacturing joint venture that is owned by us and by kronos worldwide 
the capacity shown reflects our interest in louisiana pigment company lp we are well positioned to implement a number of low cost expansions of our greatham  uk and huelva  spain plants 
we are also well positioned to selectively invest in new plant capacity based upon our icon chloride technology 
icon technology allows for the construction of new capacity with world scale economics at a minimum nameplate size of  tonnes 
we believe competing chloride technologies typically require a minimum capacity of  tonnes to achieve comparable economics 
our chloride additions can be more easily absorbed into the market  which provides higher investment returns than larger capacity additions 
joint ventures we own a interest in louisiana pigment company lp  a manufacturing joint venture located in lake charles  louisiana 
the remaining interest is held by our joint venture partner  kronos worldwide 
we share production offtake and operating costs of the plant equally with kronos worldwide  though we market our share of the production independently 
the operations of the joint venture are under the direction of a supervisory committee on which each partner has equal representation 
our investment in louisiana pigment company lp is accounted for using the equity method 
raw materials the primary raw materials used to produce titanium dioxide are titanium bearing ores 
we purchase the majority of our ore under long term supply contracts with a number of ore suppliers 
the majority of titanium bearing ores are sourced from australia  south africa and canada 
ore accounts for approximately of pigment variable manufacturing costs  while utilities electricity  gas and steam  sulfuric acid and chlorine collectively account for approximately of our variable manufacturing costs 
the world market for titanium bearing ores is dominated by rio tinto and iluka  which account for approximately of global supply 
both companies produce a range of ores for use in chloride and sulfate processes 
we purchase approximately of our ore from these two producers 
new players  such as taicor in south africa and vv minerals in india  have recently entered the market  however  creating an oversupply of most products 
consequently  the price of most titanium bearing ores has declined in the last five years  and the ability of major producers to control prices has diminished 
given the small number of suppliers and end users of titanium bearing ores  we typically enter into longer term supply agreements with beneficial terms 
approximately of our ore purchases are made under agreements with terms of three to five years 
titanium dioxide producers extract titanium from ores and process it into pigmentary titanium dioxide using either the chloride or sulfate process 
once an intermediate titanium dioxide pigment has been produced  it is finished into a product with specific performance characteristics for particular end use applications 
the finishing process is common to both the sulfate and chloride processes and is a major determinant of the final product s performance characteristics 
the sulfate process generally uses less refined ores that are cheaper to purchase but produce more co product than the chloride process 
co products from both processes require treatment prior to disposal in order to comply with environmental regulations 
in order to reduce our disposal costs and to increase our cost competitiveness  we have developed and marketed the co products of our pigments business 
we sell over of the co products generated by our business 
competition the global markets in which our pigments business operates are highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on price 
in addition  we also compete on the basis of product quality and service 
the major global producers against whom we compete are dupont  tronox  kronos and lyondell 
we believe that our competitive product offerings  combined with our presence in numerous local markets  makes us an effective competitor in the global market  particularly with respect to those global customers demanding presence in the various regions in which they conduct business 
polymers general we manufacture and market polypropylene  polyethylene  expandable polystyrene eps  eps packaging and apao 
we consume internally produced and third party sourced base petrochemicals  including ethylene and propylene  as our primary raw materials in the manufacture of these products 
in our polyethylene  apao and certain of our polypropylene product lines  we pursue a targeted marketing strategy by focusing on those customers and end use applications that require customized polymer formulations 
we produce these products at our smaller and more flexible polymers manufacturing facilities and generally sell them at premium prices 
in our other product lines  including the balance of our polypropylene  eps and eps packaging  we maintain leading regional market positions and operate cost competitive manufacturing facilities 
we operate six primary polymers manufacturing facilities in north america and australia 
we are expanding the geographic scope for sales of polyethylene and improving the integration of our european base chemicals business through the construction of an integrated  low cost  world scale ldpe plant to be located adjacent to our existing olefins facility in wilton  uk upon completion of this facility  which we expect will occur in late  we will consume approximately of the output from our uk ethylene unit in the production of ldpe 
products and markets we have the capacity to produce approximately million pounds of ldpe and million pounds of lldpe annually at our integrated odessa  texas facility 
our polyethylene customer base includes appleton papers  automated packaging and sealed air 
we produce a variety of grades of ldpe using both the tubular and autoclave processes 
many of the resins are designed to meet specific requirements of particular end users 
various types of conversion equipment  including extension coating  blown and cast film extrusion  injection and blow molding  and other proprietary methods of extrusion  use these differentiated polyethylene resins to provide high clarity  durability and sealability performance characteristics 
liner grade general purpose polyethylene ordinarily competes principally on the basis of price  while more differentiated polyethylene competes principally on the basis of product quality  performance specifications and  to a lesser extent  price 
we participate in both market areas  but concentrate our efforts primarily in more differentiated areas 
our lldpe products contain octene copolymers and are sold into applications that require high performance properties such as strength  clarity  processability  and they contain few resin imperfections low gel 
these products are used in wide variety of applications such as high performance flexible packaging  high clarity shrink films  barrier films  medical products  artificial turf and irrigation tubing 
with our higher performing product line  we compete with a limited number of competitors on the basis of product performance and  to a lesser extent  price 
we have the capacity to produce approximately billion pounds of polypropylene annually at three production facilities longview  texas with a capacity of approximately million pounds per year  marysville  michigan with a capacity of approximately million pounds per year  and odessa  texas with a capacity of approximately million pounds per year 
our polypropylene customer base includes advanced composites  ashland  seaquist closures  polyone and precise technologies 
we employ a variety of technologies to produce different grades of polypropylene  allowing us to participate in a wide range of polypropylene applications 
we provide product solutions to processors and oems that require special or unique formulations or characteristics 
our products are used extensively in medical applications  caps and closures  higher value automotive parts  consumer durables  and furniture 
our in reactor thermal plastic olefin tpo products produced at our marysville  michigan facility have replaced more expensive compounded plastics 
our odessa  texas facility produces grades of polypropylene utilized for medical applications  specialty films and sheets and electronics packaging 
these applications have allowed us to realize substantial premium prices over commodity polypropylene 
we have the capacity to produce approximately million pounds of rextac apao annually at our facility in odessa  texas 
we are one of only two on purpose producers of apao in the us rextac apao is a proprietary  patented  low molecular weight  amorphous material that utilizes polypropylene as its primary raw material 
it is used extensively in roofing materials  hot melt adhesives  laminations and wire and cable coatings 
our products are sold primarily in the us  although we also participate in the rapidly growing asian market 
our apao customer base includes firestone building products  kimberly clark and johns manville 
we have the capacity to produce approximately million pounds of eps annually at our facilities in north america and australia 
we sell into the construction industry  where the product is used for insulation  and into the small but rapidly growing insulated concrete form market 
the products also are used in electronics and produce packaging applications 
our specialty grades include r mer rubber modified eps and fire retardant grades 
our eps customer base includes aptco  cellofoam  life like products and premier industries 
we are in the process of engineering and constructing a new ldpe plant at our wilton  uk site 
we believe that the cost position of our wilton  uk olefins facility uniquely positions it to be the site of a world scale polyethylene production facility 
while we export approximately one third of our ethylene production each year from wilton  uk to continental europe  incurring significant shipping and handling costs  the uk annually imports approximately billion pounds of polyethylene 
we believe this provides an opportunity to capitalize on the low cost operating position and extensive petrochemical infrastructure and logistics at the wilton site 
the announced ldpe facility is planned to have the capacity to produce approximately million pounds of ldpe annually and is estimated to cost approximately million to construct 
a grant of approximately million has been awarded by the uk government  leaving our cost at million 
the facility is expected be operational in late polymers markets are global commodity markets 
demand for polymers tends to be less susceptible to economic cycles than some of our base petrochemicals  as the products are generally sold into the packaging and consumer markets 
demand for lldpe  which represents the growth segment of the polyethylene sector has grown at gdp rates 
growth rates for ldpe  a more mature product  have been less than per year 
polypropylene has grown at rates above gdp as these products have replaced other polymers and materials including wood  paper  glass and aluminum due to their superior performance characteristics 
our polymers are subject to fluctuations in price as a result of supply and demand imbalances and feedstock price movements 
competition is based on price  product performance  product quality  product deliverability and customer service 
polymers profitability is affected by the worldwide level of demand for polymers  along with vigorous price competition that may result from  among other things  new domestic and foreign industry capacity 
in general  demand is a function of economic growth in the us  europe and elsewhere around the world 
polypropylene is one of the most versatile and among the fastest growing of the major polymers 
polypropylene is used in a wide variety of applications including toys  housewares  bottle caps  outdoor furniture  utensils and packaging film 
although polypropylene comes in many formulations  there are three basic grades homopolymers derived from the polymerization of propylene  random copolymers derived from the polymerization of propylene and a small amount of ethylene  and impact copolymers derived by first polymerizing propylene and then adding a small amount of polymerized ethylene 
polypropylene is rising in popularity relative to other higher cost polymers due to its overall product performance and its relatively low cost of production 
different polypropylene formulations are custom manufactured with a variety of characteristics to accommodate end users 
these characteristics include high stiffness  dimensional stability  low moisture absorption  good electrical insulation and optical properties and resistance to acids  alkalis and solvents 
new applications have accounted for significant growth in the past decade in areas such as polypropylene film and automotive parts for the replacement of heavier  more expensive materials 
polyethylene represents by sales volume the most widely produced thermoplastic resin in the world 
there are two basic grades of polyethylene resin  high density and low density 
within low density  there is a further differentiation between ldpe and lldpe 
ldpe is used in a wide variety of applications  including film packaging  molded furniture  toys  wire and cable insulation 
while lldpe is used in many of the same applications as ldpe  it is also used in caps and closures  stretch and shrink binding films and heavy duty shipping sacks due to its high strength characteristics 
lldpe and ldpe are used in a wide variety of industrial and consumer applications  the largest of which is the film market 
flexible films are used in food and consumer packaging  medical applications and wrap film 
liner grade general purpose polyethylene ordinarily competes principally on the basis of price  while more differentiated polyethylene competes principally on the basis of product quality  performance specifications and  to a lesser extent  price 
eps serves two primary end markets the block eps market and the shape eps market 
block eps is used largely by the construction industry and shape eps is used largely in packaging applications 
producers typically maintain strong links to the approximately domestic molders  leading to product differentiation and customization for clients 
molders are typically small  privately held companies that rely on strong supplier relationships 
in  imported eps beads grew significantly  since domestic capacity is no longer sufficient to satisfy demand 
sales and marketing our polymers business markets over of its products through a direct  salaried sales force 
our sales force is organized by product line and by geographic region 
we also utilize distributors to market certain of our products to smaller customers 
due to the diversity of products  technologies  and grades  we are able to compete across a broad range of markets without relying upon a few large customers 
approximately of our polymers sales are channeled through two large distributors  which market to many small customers 
no one customer constitutes more than of sales 
manufacturing and operations we have the capacity to produce approximately billion pounds of polymers at our six plants located in north america and australia 
information regarding these facilities is set forth in the following chart odessa  texas longview  texas marysville  michigan peru  illinois mansonville quebec  west footscray  australia total millions of pounds ethylene propylene ldpe lldpe polypropylene  apao eps styrene our odessa  texas olefins plant produces both ethylene and propylene 
ethylene is transferred to ldpe and lldpe for polymerization  and is also utilized in polypropylene and apao copolymer production 
ethylene capacity is greater than current polymer capacity 
to maximize ethylene production  we produce cryogenic ethylene and sell it via tank car to customers without pipeline access 
there are only two other sellers of liquid ethylene  equistar and eastman 
this product is sold at a significant premium to market pricing for pipeline delivered ethylene 
our longview  texas facility is our most cost efficient facility 
incorporating the unipol gas phase production technology  this facility has the capability to produce a broad range of polypropylene grades 
this facility is connected by pipeline to the mont belvieu  texas propylene supply grid and has recently added railcar unloading infrastructure  giving it maximum raw material supply flexibility 
our marysville  michigan facility s technology is ideally suited to produce special grades of co polymer polypropylene 
this technology allows the plant to produce higher value tpos  which are used extensively in high value specialty automotive applications 
our peru  illinois eps facility is one of the world s largest eps production facilities  with five reactors 
the use of our proprietary one step eps production technology keeps production costs at the peru facility among the lowest in the industry 
our mansonville  quebec eps plant is a smaller plant with three reactors 
the eps is used primarily to produce packaging  which has historically been a premium market 
our west footscray  australia facility  located near melbourne  is australia s only producer of styrene and eps 
during the third quarter of  we concluded that the long lived assets of our australian styrenics business were impaired as a result of disappointing performance and the lack of anticipated strengthening of the styrenics market 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the third quarter of related to the australian styrenics assets 
we also produce phenolic and polyester resins and  in a joint venture with dow  polystyrene 
we also own australia s largest eps epp molding business  with seven operations around the country 
raw materials our odessa  texas facility has access to numerous sources of ngl feedstocks 
we operate a feedstock fractionator which separates ethane from other feedstock streams for use in our olefins unit 
propylene is the most significant raw material used in the production of polypropylene 
at our longview  texas and marysville  michigan sites we purchase polymer grade propylene from third parties 
the primary raw material in the production of eps is styrene 
we purchase toll styrene for our peru  illinois and mansonville  quebec facilities at market price from unaffiliated third parties 
competition in  there were approximately nine domestic producers of ldpe resins  either as ldpe or as lldpe 
the five largest domestic producers of both ldpe and lldpe in were exxonmobil  dow  equistar  westlake and chevronphillips 
there are currently us producers of polypropylene  operating plants 
the largest producer and marketer is exxonmobil  followed by bp  basell and atofina 
we are the eighth largest us producer of polypropylene 
there are five producers of eps in north america 
we are the second largest producer of eps in north america 
the other major eps producers are basf  nova chemicals  polioles sa and styrochem 
base chemicals general we are a highly integrated north american and european producer of olefins and aromatics 
we consume a substantial portion of our base chemicals products  such as ethylene  propylene and benzene  in our performance products and polyurethanes segments 
we believe this integration leads to higher operating rates for our base chemical assets  improved reliability of raw material supply for our other segments and reduced logistics and transportation costs 
we operate four base chemicals manufacturing facilities located on the texas gulf coast and in northeast england 
these facilities are equipped to process a variety of oil and natural gas based feedstocks and benefit from their close proximity to multiple sources of these raw materials 
this flexibility allows us to optimize our operating costs 
these facilities also benefit from extensive underground storage capacity and logistics infrastructure  including pipelines  deepwater jetties and ethylene liquefaction facilities 
for more information  see recent developments impact of us gulf coast storms above 
products and markets olefins 
in the us  we produce ethylene and propylene at our port arthur and port neches  texas olefins manufacturing facilities 
the port arthur steam cracker has the capacity to produce approximately billion pounds of ethylene and approximately million pounds of propylene per year and has the capability to process both light and heavy feedstock  giving us the opportunity to maximize profitability with an optimal selection of raw materials 
the port neches facility has the capacity to produce approximately million pounds of ethylene and approximately million pounds of propylene per year and has the capability to process ethane and propane and to recover ethylene and propylene from refinery off gas 
ethylene production at our port neches facility was idled in june and has been recently restarted  with full production beginning in the fourth quarter of substantial portions of our ethylene and propylene are used downstream in our performance products and polyurethanes segments 
we believe that our olefins facility at wilton  uk is one of europe s largest single site and lowest cost olefins facilities 
our wilton facility has the capacity to produce approximately billion pounds of ethylene  million pounds of propylene and million pounds of butadiene per year 
the wilton olefins facility benefits from its north sea location and significant feedstock flexibility  which allows for processing of naphthas  condensates and ngls 
in addition  the facility benefits from extensive underground storage capacity and logistics infrastructure  including pipelines  deepwater jetties and ethylene liquefaction facilities 
we are among the largest us producers of butadiene with annual capacity of approximately million pounds 
on february   we announced that we had signed a letter of intent to sell the assets of our u 
s 
butadiene and mtbe business operated in our base chemicals segment  which includes our manufacturing facility located at port neches  texas  to texas petrochemicals  lp see recent developments pending sale of lp butadiene and mtbe business above 
aromatics 
we are among the largest us producers of cyclohexane and have the capacity to produce approximately million pounds of cyclohexane annually at our port arthur  texas facility 
virtually all cyclohexane is converted to other intermediate chemicals used to produce nylon and nylon  synthetic fibers and resins 
the nylon fibers are used to manufacture products such as hosiery  upholstery  carpet and tire cord  and the resins are used in engineered plastic applications 
the port arthur facility extracts benzene from byproduct streams produced by our olefins facility 
we also purchase byproduct streams from neighboring facilities 
we produce aromatics in europe at our two integrated manufacturing facilities located in wilton  uk and north tees  uk we are a leading european producer of cyclohexane with million pounds of annual capacity  a leading producer of paraxylene with million pounds of annual capacity and are among europe s larger producers of benzene with  million pounds of annual capacity 
we use most of the benzene produced by our aromatics operations internally in the production of nitrobenzene for our polyurethanes business and for the production of cyclohexane 
the balance of our european aromatics production is sold to several key customers 
we also have the capacity to produce approximately million gallons of mtbe annually at our port neches  texas facility 
in  we produced approximately million gallons of mtbe from the conversion of byproduct isobutylenes that we extracted from our unit and neighboring refineries 
we recently announced that we have signed a letter of intent to sell the assets of our u 
s 
butadiene and mtbe business operated in our base chemicals segment  which includes our manufacturing facility located at port neches  texas  to texas petrochemicals  lp we expect the transaction to close in mid see recent developments pending sale of us butadiene and mtbe business above 
petrochemical markets are global commodity markets 
however  the olefins market is subject to some regional price differences due to the more limited inter regional trade resulting from the high costs of product transportation 
the global petrochemicals market is cyclical and is subject to pricing swings due to supply and demand imbalances  feedstock prices primarily driven by crude oil and natural gas prices and general economic conditions 
the olefins markets in both north america and western europe are supplied by numerous producers  none of whom has a dominant position in terms of its share of production capacity 
major producers include bp  dow  equistar  exxonmobil  sabic and shell 
the aromatics market  which is primarily composed of cyclohexane  benzene and paraxylene  is characterized by several major producers  including bp  chevronphillips  dow  exxonmobil and shell 
we believe the global markets for most aromatics products have recently recovered from the cyclical lows experienced over the last several years as demand has increased due to recent growth in demand for certain derivative products  including polyester fibers and pet packaging resins 
also  new capacity additions have been limited  which has resulted in higher industry operating rates 
sales and marketing in recent years  our sales and marketing efforts have focused on developing long term contracts with customers to operate our facilities at maximum rates  while maintaining very low selling expenses and administration costs 
in  over and of our external primary petrochemicals sales volume in north america and europe  respectively  was made under contracts of a year or more 
in addition  we delivered over and of our primary external petrochemical products volume in north america and europe  respectively  in by pipeline 
major aromatics customers include basf  bayer  dupont sa  invista  rhodia and solutia 
major olefins customers include bp  dow  dupont  evc  nova  shell and solvay 
in north america  we benefit from our pipeline system that extends over miles  which we use to transport feedstocks and intermediate and finished products 
in the uk  we own or have access to major pipeline systems connecting our plants to our customers 
our finished product pipelines allow us to ship ethylene  propylene and butadiene directly to our customers at very low cost 
addition of new pipeline connections represents a significant barrier to potential competitors 
we believe that the wide coverage of our pipeline system  coupled with the proximity of both customers and suppliers  gives us a competitive advantage both in receiving raw materials and in delivering ethylene and propylene to our key customers 
manufacturing and operations the annual production capacities of our olefins and aromatics facilities is set forth below port arthur  texas port neches  texas odessa  texas wilton  uk north tees  uk total millions of pounds ethylene    propylene  butadiene  paraxylene benzene   cyclohexane  mtbe our odessa  texas olefins unit primarily provides raw materials for our polymers segment

butadiene and mtbe business operated in our base chemicals segment  which includes our manufacturing facility located at port neches  texas  to texas petrochemicals  lp we expect the transaction to close in mid millions of gallons 
raw materials the primary raw materials that we use as feedstocks in our base chemicals business are hydrocarbons produced as byproducts of the refining crude oil and natural gas  such as ethane  propane and butane 
these materials are actively traded on the spot and futures markets and are readily available from multiple sources 
we benefit from our locations in texas  where we neighbor mont belvieu  which is a hub for the distribution of these feedstocks  and in the uk  where we are able to take advantage of our pipeline system and our proximity to refineries located near the north sea 
in the us  pipelines allow us to transport liquid hydrocarbon feedstocks from mont belvieu  texas to our port arthur and port neches facilities 
we are tied into the extensive industry pipeline grid for receipt of natural gases and ngls  and have dock and tank facilities for receipt of feedstocks by tanker and barge 
our north tees facility  situated on the northeast coast of england  is near a substantial supply of oil  natural gas and chemical feedstocks 
due to our location at north tees  we have the option to purchase feedstocks from a variety of sources 
however  we have elected to procure the majority of our naphtha  condensates and ngls from local producers as they have been the most economical sources 
in order to secure the optimal mix of the required quality and type of feedstock for our petrochemical operations at fully competitive prices  we regularly engage in the purchase and sale of feedstocks 
competition the markets in which our base chemicals business operates are highly competitive 
our competitors in the olefins and aromatics markets include bp  dow  equistar  exxonmobil  sabic and shell 
while the market for most of these products is global  prices tend to be set regionally 
these industries are characterized by companies that have large market shares in specific regions 
the primary factors for competition in this business are price  reliability of supply and customer service 
the technology used in these businesses is mature and widely available

employees as of december   we employed approximately  people in our operations around the world 
approximately  of these employees are located in the us  while approximately  are located in other countries 
we believe our relations with our employees are good 
environmental  health and safety matters general we are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations  rules and ordinances relating to pollution  protection of the environment and the generation  storage  handling  transportation  treatment  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 
in the ordinary course of business  we are subject to frequent environmental inspections and monitoring and occasional investigations by governmental enforcement authorities 
in addition  our production facilities require operating permits that are subject to renewal  modification and  in certain circumstances  revocation 
actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations  substantial civil or criminal sanctions  as well as  under some environmental laws  the assessment of strict liability and or joint and several liability 
moreover  changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations  or require us to modify our facilities or operations 
accordingly  environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses  costs or liabilities 
environmental  health and safety systems we are committed to achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable environmental  health and safety ehs legal requirements  and we have developed policies and management systems that are intended to identify the multitude of ehs legal requirements applicable to our operations  enhance compliance with applicable legal requirements  ensure the safety of our employees  contractors  community neighbors and customers and minimize the production and emission of wastes and other pollutants 
although ehs legal requirements are constantly changing and are frequently difficult to comply with  these ehs management systems are designed to assist us in our compliance goals while also fostering efficiency and improvement and minimizing overall risk to us 
ehs capital expenditures we may incur future costs for capital improvements and general compliance under ehs laws  including costs to acquire  maintain and repair pollution control equipment 
for the years ended december  and  our capital expenditures for ehs matters totaled million and million  respectively 
since capital expenditures for these matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend  in part  on the timing  promulgation and enforcement of specific requirements  we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures will be indicative of future amounts required under ehs laws 
governmental enforcement proceedings on occasion  we receive notices of violation  enforcement and other complaints from regulatory agencies alleging non compliance with applicable ehs law 
by way of example  we are aware of the individual matters set out below  which we believe to be the most significant presently pending matters and unasserted claims 
although we may incur costs or penalties in connection with the governmental proceedings discussed below  based on currently available information and our past experience  we believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the state of texas settled an air enforcement case with us relating to our port arthur plant 
under the settlement  we are required to pay a civil penalty of million over more than four years  undertake environmental monitoring projects totaling about million in costs  and pay million in attorney s fees to the texas attorney general 
as of december   we have paid million toward the penalty and million for the attorney s fees 
the monitoring projects are underway and on schedule 
we do not anticipate that this settlement will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
beginning in the third quarter of and extending through december  we have received notifications of approximately eight separate enforcement actions from the texas commission on environmental quality tceq for alleged violations related to air emissions at our port neches or our port arthur plant 
these alleged violations primarily relate to specific upset emissions  emissions from cooling towers  or flare operations occurring at particular times and at particular operating units during and these notices of violation appear to be part of a larger enforcement initiative by the tceq regional office focused on upset emissions at chemical and refining industry plants located within the beaumont port arthur region 
tceq has made individual proposals to us to resolve four of the notices of alleged violation for approximately million each 
tceq has also made a proposal to resolve one of the remaining notices  addressing upset emissions at port neches  for million 
tceq has not made a penalty proposal for two other notices  and the final notice is seeking a penalty of less than  final resolution of these matters is subject to negotiation between us and tceq 
we do not believe that the resolution of these matters will result in the imposition of costs material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
by letter dated september   the tamil nadu pollution control board the tnpcb issued an order in follow up to a show cause notice dated june   requiring a manufacturing facility of petro araldite private limited  a subsidiary of admat in chennai  india  to close for one week and to submit an action plan and timeline to reduce chemical oxygen demand in its wastewater effluent 
the facility complied with the order and submitted an action plan to the tnpcb  which has been accepted pending installation of assets to remedy the issue 
a consent order renewal was subsequently issued covering the period through march  the proposed changes are being installed and we expect these modifications to resolve the current issues with the tnpcb 
ultimately  if the asset modifications do not resolve the effluent issue  or the tnpcb believes the plan or its implementation is inadequate  the tnpcb has the power to take further enforcement action  including shutting down the facility for a longer period or permanently  initiating criminal sanctions or imposing fines 
nevertheless  we believe that the investments in progress will fully resolve this matter 
if they do not  however  the ultimate resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of environmental lawsuits brought by private party plaintiffs 
remediation liabilities we have incurred  and we may in the future incur  liability to investigate and clean up waste or contamination at our current or former facilities or facilities operated by third parties at which we may have disposed of waste or other materials 
similarly  we may incur costs for the cleanup of wastes that were disposed of prior to the purchase of our businesses 
under some circumstances  the scope of our liability may extend to damages to natural resources 
specifically  under the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  and similar state laws  a current or former owner or operator of real property may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred  and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release 
in addition  under the us resource conservation and recovery act of  as amended rcra  and similar state laws  we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties as a condition to our hazardous waste permit 
for example  our odessa  port arthur  and port neches facilities in texas are the subject of ongoing remediation requirements under rcra authority 
in many cases  our potential liability arising from historical contamination is based on operations and other events occurring prior to our ownership of the relevant facility 
in these situations  we frequently obtained an indemnity agreement from the prior owner addressing remediation liabilities arising from pre closing conditions 
we have successfully exercised our rights under these contractual covenants for a number of sites  and where applicable  mitigated our ultimate remediation liability 
we cannot assure you  however  that all of such matters will be subject to indemnity or that our existing indemnities will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for such matters 
some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use  including on site waste disposal 
we are aware of soil  groundwater and surface water contamination from past operations at some of our sites  and we may find contamination at other sites in the future 
based on available information and the indemnification rights we believe are likely to be available  we believe that the costs to investigate and remediate known contamination will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if such indemnities are unavailable or do not fully cover the costs of investigation and remediation or we are required to contribute to such costs  and if such costs are material  then such expenditures may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
at the current time  we are unable to estimate the full cost  exclusive of indemnification benefits  to remediate any of the known contamination sites 
we have been notified by third parties of claims against us or our subsidiaries for cleanup liabilities at approximately former facilities and other third party sites  including but not limited to sites listed under cercla 
based on current information and past experience at other cercla sites  we do not expect any of these third party claims to result in a material liability to us 
environmental reserves we have established financial reserves relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations  site reclamation and closure costs and known penalties 
liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
our liability estimates are based upon available facts  existing technology and past experience 
on a consolidated basis  we have accrued approximately million and million for environmental liabilities as of december  and  respectively 
of these amounts  approximately million and million are classified as accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively  and approximately million and million are classified as other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
in certain cases  our remediation liabilities are payable over periods of up to years 
we may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued  however  we are not able to estimate the amount or range of such potential excess 
regulatory developments under the european union eu integrated pollution prevention and control directive ippc  eu member governments are to adopt rules and implement a cross media air  water and waste environmental permitting program for individual facilities 
while the eu countries are at varying stages in their respective implementation of the ippc permit program  we have submitted all necessary ippc permit applications required to date  and in some cases received completed permits from the applicable government agency 
we expect to submit all other ippc applications and related documents on a timely basis as the various countries implement the ippc permit program 
although we do not know with certainty what each ippc permit will require  we believe  based upon our experience with the permits received to date  that the costs of compliance with the ippc permit program will not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the european commission ec adopted a proposal for a new eu regulatory framework for chemicals 
under this proposed new system called reach registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals  companies that manufacture or import more than one ton of a chemical substance per year would be required to register such manufacture or import in a central database 
on november   the european parliament completed its first reading of the ec drafted reach legislation 
ministers from eu s member states sitting as the council finalized their own position on the text on december   paving the way for final agreement between parliament and the council in late and for reach to become law in early as proposed  reach would require risk assessment of chemicals  preparations eg  soaps and paints and articles eg  consumer products before those materials could be manufactured or imported into eu countries 
where warranted by a risk assessment  hazardous substances would require authorizations for their use 
this regulation could impose risk control strategies that would require expenditures by us 
as currently envisioned  reach would take effect in three primary stages over eleven years following the final effective date assuming final approval 
the impacts of reach on the chemical industry and on us are unclear at this time because the parameters of the program are still in development 
mtbe developments we produce mtbe  an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
the use of mtbe has become controversial in the us and elsewhere and has been curtailed and may be eliminated in the future by legislation or regulatory action 
for example  about states have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict the use of mtbe in gasoline sold in those states 
those states account for a substantial portion of the pre ban us mtbe market 
in addition  the energy policy act of is beginning to have an adverse impact on our mtbe business in the us  since it mandates increased use of renewable fuels and eliminates the oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline established by the clean air act amendments 
although the extent of the potential impact of the new law is still unclear  there have been indications that certain gasoline refiners and distributors may stop using mtbe and that certain pipeline companies may stop shipping gasoline containing mtbe 
a significant loss in demand for our mtbe in the us could result in a material loss in revenues or material costs or expenditures 
moreover  additional phase outs or other future regulation of mtbe may result in a further reduction in demand for our mtbe in the us in  we marketed approximately of our mtbe to customers located in the us for use as a gasoline additive 
most of our sales of mtbe to us customers were made pursuant to long term agreements 
during and concluding by the first quarter of  our long term mtbe sales agreements will terminate 
we anticipate that our sales of mtbe in the us will decrease substantially as compared to levels 
nevertheless  we expect to continue to sell a portion of our mtbe into the us market  although not pursuant to any new long term agreements 
we have entered into sales agreements to sell a significant percentage of our mtbe into the latin american market  and we currently believe that we could also sell mtbe relatively efficiently in europe and asia 
nevertheless  as a result of varying market prices and transportation costs  sales of mtbe in markets outside the us may produce lower margins than the sale of mtbe in the us we may also elect to use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe 
if we opt to produce products other than mtbe  necessary modifications to our facilities will require us to make significant capital expenditures and the sale of such other products may produce a lower level of cash flow than the sale of mtbe 
a number of lawsuits have been filed  primarily against gasoline manufacturers  marketers and distributors  by persons seeking to recover damages allegedly arising from the presence of mtbe in groundwater 
while we have not been named as a defendant in any litigation concerning the environmental effects of mtbe  we cannot provide assurances that we will not be involved in any such litigation or that such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

item a 
risk factors any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have a history of losses and may incur losses in the future  which could materially reduce the market price of our securities 
we incurred net losses in each of the last five fiscal years 
we will need to continue to generate additional revenues and or significantly reduce costs  including interest expense  in order to avoid additional net losses in future periods 
if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
failure to achieve or maintain profitability may materially reduce the market price of our securities 
demand for many of our products is cyclical  and we may experience prolonged depressed market conditions for such products 
historically  the markets for many of our products  particularly our commodity products  have experienced alternating periods of tight supply  causing prices and profit margins to increase  followed by periods of capacity additions  resulting in oversupply and declining prices and profit margins 
currently  several of our markets continue to experience conditions of oversupply  and the pricing of our products in these markets is depressed 
future growth in demand for these products may not be sufficient to alleviate any existing or future conditions of excess industry capacity  and such conditions may be sustained or further aggravated by anticipated or unanticipated capacity additions or other events 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of commodity products 
due to the commodity nature of these products  competition in these markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on performance  product quality  product deliverability and customer service 
as a result  we may not be able to protect our market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to our customers 
historically  the prices for our commodity products have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand  the availability and price of feedstocks and general economic conditions 
our other products may be subject to these same factors  but  typically  the impact of these factors is greatest on our commodity products 
significant price volatility or interruptions in supply of our raw materials may result in increased costs that we may be unable to pass on to our customers  which could reduce our profitability 
the prices of the raw materials that we purchase from third parties are cyclical and volatile 
we purchase a substantial portion of these raw materials from third party suppliers  and the cost of these raw materials represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses 
the prices for a number of these raw materials generally follow price trends of  and vary with market conditions for  crude oil and natural gas feedstocks  which are highly volatile and cyclical 
in recent periods we have experienced significantly higher crude oil prices  which have resulted in increased raw material prices 
although we frequently enter into supply agreements to acquire these raw materials  these agreements typically provide for market based pricing and provide us only limited protection against price volatility 
while we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding product price increases  we are not always able to raise product prices immediately or at all 
timing differences between raw material prices  which may change daily  and contract product prices  which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often  have had and may continue to have a negative effect on profitability 
if any of our suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under present supply agreements  we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources and we may not be able to increase prices for our finished products to recoup the higher raw materials cost 
in addition  if any of the raw materials that we use become unavailable within the geographic area from which they are now sourced  then we may not be able to obtain suitable and cost effective substitutes 
any underlying cost increase that we are not able to pass on to our customers or any interruption in supply of raw materials could increase our costs or decrease our revenues  which could reduce our profitability 
natural or other disasters could disrupt our business and result in loss of revenue or in higher expenses 
any natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of our facilities due to hurricane  fire  earthquake  flood  terrorist attack or any other natural or man made disaster could impair our ability to use our facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase our costs and expenses 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from products manufactured at facilities  including among others  our us gulf coast facilities  which are exposed to the risk of natural disasters 
if there is a natural disaster or other serious disruption at any of these facilities  it could impair our ability to adequately supply our customers and negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  many of our current and potential customers are concentrated in specific geographic areas 
a natural disaster in one of these regions could have a material adverse impact on our us and foreign operations  operating results and financial condition 
our available cash and access to additional capital may be limited by our substantial leverage  which could restrict our ability to grow our businesses 
we reduced our indebtedness net of cash  including outstanding borrowings under our off balance sheet accounts receivable securitization program  during by approximately billion  but we still have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding 
as of december   we had total consolidated outstanding indebtedness of approximately billion including the current portion of long term debt 
we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time for a variety of purposes 
our outstanding debt could have important consequences for our businesses  including a high degree of debt will make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our businesses  our industry or the economy in general as a significant percentage of our cash flow from operations will be required to make payments on our indebtedness  making it more difficult to react to changes in our business and in market or industry conditions  a substantial portion of our future cash flow from operations may be required to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes  including the growth of our businesses and the payment of dividends  our ability to obtain additional financing may be constrained due to our existing level of debt  and part of our indebtedness is  and any future debt may be  subject to variable interest rates  which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
our existing debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to utilize our cash flow to operate our businesses by restricting our ability to  among other things  make prepayments of certain debt  receive dividends from our subsidiaries  make investments and merge or consolidate and transfer or sell assets 
as of december   the current portion of our long term debt totaled million 
we estimate that our annual interest expense for will be approximately million 
as of december   we had combined outstanding variable rate borrowings of approximately billion 
assuming a increase in interest rates  without giving effect to interest rate hedges  our annual interest rate expense would increase by approximately million 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain the funds required to meet payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness  we could be in default under the terms of those instruments 
in the event of a default  a holder of the indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed under those instruments to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest  the lenders under our credit facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder and we or one or more of our subsidiaries could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation 
any of the foregoing consequences could restrict our ability to grow our business and cause the value of our securities to decline 
a downgrade in the ratings of the debt securities of our subsidiaries could result in increased interest and other financial expenses related to future borrowings of our subsidiaries and could restrict our access to additional capital or trade credit 
standard and poor s ratings services and moody s investors service maintain credit ratings for us and hi 
each of these ratings is currently below investment grade 
any decision by these or other ratings agencies to downgrade such ratings in the future could result in increased interest and other financial expenses relating to our future borrowings and could restrict our ability to obtain additional financing on satisfactory terms 
in addition  any downgrade could restrict our access to  and negatively impact the terms of  trade credit extended by our suppliers of raw materials 
existing or future litigation or legislative initiatives restricting the use of mtbe in gasoline may subject us or our products to environmental liability  materially reduce our sales and or materially increase our costs 
we produce mtbe  an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce vehicle air emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
the use of mtbe has become controversial in the us and elsewhere and has been curtailed and may be eliminated in the future by legislation or regulatory action 
for example  about states have adopted rules that prohibit or restrict the use of mtbe in gasoline sold in those states 
those states account for a substantial portion of the pre ban us mtbe market 
in addition  the energy policy act of is beginning to have an adverse impact on our mtbe business in the us  since it mandates increased use of renewable fuels and eliminates the oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline established by the clean air act amendments 
although the extent of the potential impact of the new law is still unclear  there have been indications that certain gasoline refiners and distributors may stop using mtbe and that certain pipeline companies may stop shipping gasoline containing mtbe 
a significant loss in demand for our mtbe in the us could result in a material loss in revenues or material costs or expenditures 
moreover  additional phase outs or other future regulation of mtbe may result in a further reduction in demand for our mtbe in the us in  we marketed approximately of our mtbe to customers located in the us for use as a gasoline additive 
most of our sales of mtbe to us customers were made pursuant to long term agreements 
during and concluding by the first quarter of  our long term mtbe sales agreements will terminate 
we anticipate that our sales of mtbe in the us will decrease substantially as compared to levels 
nevertheless  we expect to continue to sell a portion of our mtbe into the us market  although not pursuant to any new long term agreements 
we have entered into sales agreements to sell a significant percentage of our mtbe into the latin american market  and we currently believe that we could also sell mtbe relatively efficiently in europe and asia

a number of lawsuits have been filed  primarily against gasoline manufacturers  marketers and distributors  by persons seeking to recover damages allegedly arising from the presence of mtbe in groundwater 
while we have not been named as a defendant in any litigation concerning the environmental effects of mtbe  we cannot provide assurances that we will not be involved in any such litigation or that such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our results of operations may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and international business risks 
some of our subsidiaries conduct a significant portion of their business outside the us these operations outside the us are subject to risks normally associated with international operations 
these risks include the need to convert currencies which may be received for our products into currencies in which our subsidiaries purchase raw materials or pay for services  which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates 
in addition  we translate our local currency financial results into us dollars based on average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period or the exchange rate at the end of that period 
during times of a strengthening us dollar  our reported international sales and earnings may be reduced because the local currency may translate into fewer us dollars 
because we currently have significant operations located in the united kingdom and continental europe  we are primarily exposed to fluctuations in the pound sterling  the euro and the swiss franc 
furthermore  we anticipate increased exposure to the chinese renminbi following completion of the construction of our mdi production facilities in china through our chinese joint ventures  currently expected in other risks of international operations include trade barriers  tariffs  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  social and political risks  general economic risks and required compliance with a variety of foreign laws  including tax laws 
furthermore  in foreign jurisdictions where process of law may vary from country to country  we may experience difficulty in enforcing agreements 
in jurisdictions where bankruptcy laws and practices may vary  we may experience difficulty collecting foreign receivables through foreign legal systems 
the occurrence of these risks could disrupt the businesses of our international subsidiaries  which could significantly affect their ability to make distributions to us 
the industries in which we compete are highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors that have greater financial resources  which could reduce the trading price of our securities 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
among our competitors are some of the world s largest chemical companies and major integrated petroleum companies that have their own raw material resources 
some of these companies may be able to produce products more economically than we can 
in addition  some of our competitors have greater financial resources  which may enable them to invest significant capital into their businesses  including expenditures for research and development 
if any of our current or future competitors develops proprietary technology that enables them to produce products at a significantly lower cost  our technology could be rendered uneconomical or obsolete 
moreover  certain of our businesses use technology that is widely available 
accordingly  barriers to entry  apart from capital availability  are low in certain commodity product segments of our business  and the entrance of new competitors into the industry may reduce our ability to capture improving profit margins in circumstances where capacity utilization in the industry is increasing 
further  petroleum rich countries have become more significant participants in the petrochemical industry and may expand this role significantly in the future 
increased competition in any of our businesses could compel us to reduce the prices of our products  which could result in reduced profit margins and or loss of market share and reduce the trading price of our securities 
our operations involve risks that may increase our operating costs  which could reduce our profitability 
although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions  our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the manufacturing and marketing of differentiated and commodity chemical products 
these hazards include chemical spills  pipeline leaks and ruptures  storage tank leaks  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other hazards incident to the manufacturing  processing  handling  transportation and storage of dangerous chemicals 
we are also potentially subject to other hazards  including natural disasters and severe weather  explosions and fires  transportation problems  including interruptions  spills and leaks  mechanical failures  unscheduled downtimes  labor difficulties  remediation complications  and other risks 
many of these hazards can cause bodily injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage  and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities 
furthermore  we are subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure  exposure of contractors on our premises as well as other persons located nearby  workers compensation and other matters 
we maintain property  business interruption and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance with customary industry practices  but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business 
we maintain property damage and business interruption insurance policies with aggregate limits of billion per occurrence and products liability and sudden and accidental insurance policies with aggregate per occurrence and annual limits of million 
we also maintain insurance policies covering other types of risks  including pollution legal liability insurance 
each of these insurance policies is subject to customary exclusions  deductibles and coverage limits 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and  in some instances  certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
if we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured  it could materially increase our operating costs and therefore reduce our profitability 
in addition  we are subject to various claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business 
in conjunction with many of our past acquisitions  we have obtained indemnity agreements from the prior owners addressing liabilities that may arise from operations and events prior to our ownership 
we are a party to several pending lawsuits and proceedings 
it is possible that a judgment could be rendered against us in these cases or others in which we could be uninsured or not covered by indemnity and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters 
see item business environmental  health and safety matters and item legal proceedings 
we are subject to many environmental and safety regulations that may result in unanticipated costs or liabilities  which could reduce our profitability 
we are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations  rules and ordinances relating to pollution  protection of the environment and the generation  storage  handling  transportation  treatment  disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials 
actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations  substantial civil or criminal sanctions  as well as  under some environmental laws  the assessment of strict liability and or joint and several liability 
moreover  changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt our operations  or require us to modify our facilities or operations 
accordingly  environmental or regulatory matters may cause us to incur significant unanticipated losses  costs or liabilities  which could reduce our profitability 
see item business environmental  health and safety matters and item legal proceedings 
in addition  we could incur significant expenditures in order to comply with existing or future environmental or safety laws 
capital expenditures and costs relating to environmental or safety matters will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose requirements on our operations 
capital expenditures and costs beyond those currently anticipated may therefore be required under existing or future environmental or safety laws 
furthermore  we may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up environmental contamination on or from our properties or at off site locations where we disposed of or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous materials or from disposal activities that pre dated our purchase of our businesses 
we may therefore incur additional costs and expenditures beyond those currently anticipated to address all such known and unknown situations under existing and future environmental laws 
see item business environmental  health and safety matters and item legal proceedings 
we can provide no assurance that our internal control over our financial reporting will be effective when section of the sarbanes oxley act of becomes applicable to us 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules issued thereunder  our management is required to conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of each year end  beginning december  from that point  we will be required to include in our annual report on form k a report on our management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
our independent registered public accounting firm will also issue an audit report on management s assessment and on our internal control over financial reporting 
we have undertaken significant efforts in preparation for the requirements of section however  given the complexities and inherent risks associated with the operation of internal control over financial reporting  we can provide no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective when section becomes applicable to us 
moreover  we can provide no assurance as to any matters that might be reported in our management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm s audit report 
ineffective internal control over financial reporting could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and could result in a lower trading price for our securities 
we are a holding company  with no revenue generating operations of our own 
we depend on the performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to make distributions to us 
we are a holding company with no business operations  sources of income  indebtedness or assets of our own other than our ownership interests in our subsidiaries 
because all our operations are conducted by our subsidiaries  our cash flow and our ability to repay our debt obligations and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders  including the dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock  are dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries 
payment of dividends  distributions  loans or advances by our subsidiaries to us are subject to restrictions imposed by the current and future debt instruments of our subsidiaries 
in addition  payments or distributions from our subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law  monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate 
as of december   our subsidiaries had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately billion including the current portion of long term debt 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities 
any right that we have to receive any assets of or distributions from any of our subsidiaries upon the bankruptcy  dissolution  liquidation or reorganization of any such subsidiary  or to realize proceeds from the sale of their assets  will be junior to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors  including trade creditors and holders of debt or preferred stock issued by that subsidiary 
our business is dependent on our intellectual property 
if our patents are declared invalid or our trade secrets become known to our competitors  our ability to compete may be impaired 
proprietary protection of our processes  apparatuses and other technology is important to our business 
consequently  we may have to rely on judicial enforcement of our patents and other proprietary rights 
while a presumption of validity exists with respect to patents issued to us in the us  there can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  if any pending patent application filed by us does not result in an issued patent  or if patents are issued to us  but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our intellectual property  then our ability to compete may be adversely affected 
additionally  our competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or sell our products in a competitive manner  which could result in significantly lower revenues  reduced profit margins and or loss of market share 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  these confidentiality agreements may be breached  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary know how  or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and know how 
in addition  others could obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means 
the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes  apparatuses  technology  trade secrets or proprietary know how could result in significantly lower revenues  reduced profit margins and or loss of market share 
loss of key members of our management could disrupt our business 
we depend on the continued employment and performance of our senior executives and other key members of management 
if any of these individuals resigns or becomes unable to continue in his present role and is not adequately replaced  our business operations and our ability to implement our growth strategies could be materially disrupted 
we generally do not have employment agreements with  and we do not maintain any key man life insurance for  any of our executive officers 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred on september   the continuing military action in iraq  general instability in various opec member nations  the threat of other attacks or acts of war in the us and abroad and increased security regulations related to our industry could adversely affect our business 
the attacks of september   and subsequent events  including the continuing military action in iraq  have caused instability in the us and other financial markets and have led  and may continue to lead  to further armed hostilities  prolonged military action in iraq  or further acts of terrorism in the us or abroad  which could cause further instability in financial markets 
current regional tensions and conflicts in various opec member nations  including the continuing military action in iraq  have caused  and may cause further  increases in raw material costs  particularly natural gas and crude oil based feedstocks  which are used in our operations 
the uncertainty surrounding the continuing military action in iraq and the threat of further armed hostilities or acts of terrorism may impact any or all of our physical facilities and operations  which are located in north america  europe  australia  asia  africa  south america and the middle east  or those of our customers 
furthermore  terrorist attacks  subsequent events and future developments in any of these areas may result in reduced demand from our customers for our products 
in addition  local  state and federal governments have begun a regulatory process that could lead to new regulations impacting the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals  which could result in higher operating costs 
these developments will subject our worldwide operations to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could result in significant unanticipated costs  lower revenues and or reduced profit margins 
future acquisitions  partnerships and joint ventures may require significant resources and or result in significant unanticipated losses  costs or liabilities 
in the future we may seek to grow our company and businesses by making acquisitions or entering into partnerships and joint ventures 
any future acquisition  partnership or joint venture may require that we make a significant cash investment  issue stock or incur substantial debt 
in addition  acquisitions  partnerships or investments may require significant managerial attention  which may be diverted from our other operations 
these capital  equity and managerial commitments may impair the operation of our businesses 
furthermore  any future acquisitions of businesses or facilities could entail a number of additional risks  including problems with effective integration of operations  the inability to maintain key pre acquisition business relationships  increased operating costs  exposure to unanticipated liabilities  and difficulties in realizing projected efficiencies  synergies and cost savings 
we have incurred indebtedness to finance past acquisitions 
we may finance future acquisitions with additional indebtedness and or by issuing additional equity securities 
as a result  we could face the financial risks associated with incurring additional indebtedness such as reducing our liquidity and access to financing markets and increasing the amount of cash flow required to service such indebtedness 
we are indirectly controlled by the huntsman family and matlinpatterson  whose interests may conflict with those of our company or our other stockholders  and other stockholders voting power may be limited 
jon m 
huntsman and other members of the huntsman family and matlinpatterson indirectly control  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock through their beneficial ownership of hmp equity trust and will have the ability to elect a majority of the members of the board of directors of our company  subject to applicable law and the rights of holders of our mandatory convertible preferred stock  determine  without the consent of our other stockholders  the outcome of certain matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including amendments to our certificate of incorporation  mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets  and subject to applicable law  prevent or cause a change in control of our company 
the interests and objectives of our controlling stockholders may be different from those of our company or our other stockholders  and our controlling stockholders may vote their common stock in a manner that may adversely affect our other stockholders

this may create conflicts of interest because these directors have responsibilities to hmp equity trust and its beneficial owners 
their duties to hmp equity trust and its beneficial owners may conflict with their duties as directors of our company regarding business dealings between hmp equity trust and us and other matters 
the resolution of these conflicts may not always be in our or our stockholders best interest 
hmp equity trust s controlling position and provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage a takeover attempt  which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and  therefore  your ability to sell your shares at a premium 
hmp equity trust s controlling position  as well as provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  such as a classified board of directors  limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders and the inability of stockholders to call special meetings  and certain provisions of delaware law  could make it more difficult for a third party other than hmp equity trust and its affiliates to acquire control of our company  even if some of our stockholders considered such a change of control to be beneficial 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if our board of directors elects to issue preferred stock that has special voting or other rights  it could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
these provisions taken together or individually may reduce or eliminate your ability to sell your shares of common stock at a premium

these plants are operated by solutia under long term operating agreements 
solutia and certain of its affiliates have filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
we expect that solutia will continue to operate these plants  although no assurance can be given at this time 
during the course of the bankruptcy proceeding  it is possible that solutia may reject any of the agreements under which it operates the plants

we have substantially reduced our operations at this site during owned manufacturing joint venture with kronos louisiana  inc  a subsidiary of kronos worldwide  inc item legal proceedings discoloration claims certain claims have been filed against us relating to discoloration of unplasticized polyvinyl chloride products allegedly caused by our titanium dioxide discoloration claims 
substantially all of the titanium dioxide that is the subject of these claims was manufactured prior to our acquisition of our titanium dioxide business from ici in net of amounts we have received from insurers and pursuant to contracts of indemnity  we have paid approximately million in costs and settlement amounts for discoloration claims as of december  the following table presents information about the number of discoloration claims for the periods indicated 
claims include all claims for which service has been received by us  and each such claim represents a plaintiff who is pursuing a claim against us 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  claims filed during period claims resolved during period claims unresolved at end of period during the year ended december   we settled claims for approximately million  approximately million of which was paid by our insurers or ici and approximately million of which was paid by us 
during  we recorded charges of million relating to discoloration claims 
during the year ended december   we settled a claim for approximately million  all of which was paid by ici 
the two discoloration claims unresolved as of december  asserted aggregate damages of approximately million 
an appropriate liability has been accrued for these claims 
based on our understanding of the merits of these claims and our rights under contracts of indemnity and insurance  we do not believe that the net impact on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity will be material 
while additional discoloration claims may be made in the future  we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of loss related to such claims 
although we may incur additional costs as a result of future claims including settlement costs  based on our history with discoloration claims to date  the fact that substantially all of the titanium dioxide that has been the subject of these discoloration claims was manufactured and sold more than six years ago  and the fact that we have rights under contract to indemnity  including from ici  we do not believe that any unasserted discoloration claims will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
based on this conclusion and our inability to reasonably estimate our expected costs with respect to these unasserted claims  we have made no accruals in our financial statements as of december  for costs associated with unasserted discoloration claims 
ciba settlement vantico  acquired by us in june  concluded that certain of the products of its former electronics division may have infringed patents owned by taiyo and it entered into a license agreement in october with taiyo to obtain the right to use the taiyo patents 
this license agreement required payment of approximately million in back royalties and agreement to pay periodic royalties for future use 
we believe that ciba specialty chemicals holdings inc ciba is liable under the indemnity provisions of certain agreements in connection with the leveraged buy out transaction in involving ciba and vantico for certain payments made under the license agreement and related costs and expenses  and we initiated an arbitration proceeding against ciba 
in july  we entered into a settlement agreement with ciba with respect to this matter 
in general  the settlement agreement provided that ciba would pay us million in we received additional consideration in the form of modifications to certain operating agreements between us and ciba 
in august  we received payment of the million settlement 
environmental litigation we have been a party to various lawsuits brought by persons alleging personal injuries and or property damage based upon alleged exposure to toxic air emissions 
for example  since june  a number of lawsuits have been filed in state district court in jefferson county  texas against several local chemical plants and refineries  including our subsidiary  huntsman petrochemical corporation 
generally  these lawsuits have alleged that the refineries and chemical plants located in the vicinity of the plaintiffs homes discharged chemicals into the air that interfere with use and enjoyment of property and cause health problems and or property damages 
none of these lawsuits have included the amount of damages being sought 
the following table presents information about the number of claims asserting damages based upon alleged exposure to toxic air emissions for the periods indicated 
claims include all claims for which service has been received by us  and each such claim represents a plaintiff who is pursuing a claim against us 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  claims filed during period  claims resolved during period  claims unresolved at end of period all claims filed as of december  have been resolved through dismissal and or settlement 
in addition  we have been named as a premises defendant in a number of asbestos exposure cases  typically a claim by a non employee of exposure to asbestos while at a facility 
in the past  these cases typically have involved multiple plaintiffs bringing actions against multiple defendants  and the complaint has not indicated which plaintiffs were making claims against which defendants  where or how the alleged injuries occurred  or what injuries each plaintiff claimed 
these facts  which would be central to any estimate of probable loss  generally have been learned only through discovery 
recent changes in texas tort procedures have required many pending cases to be split into multiple cases  one for each claimant  increasing the number of pending cases reported below for the year ended december  nevertheless  the complaints in these cases provide little additional information 
we do not believe that the increased number of cases reflects an increase in the number of underlying claims 
where the alleged exposure occurred prior to our ownership or operation of the relevant premises  the prior owners and operators generally have contractually agreed to retain liability for  and to indemnify us against  asbestos exposure claims 
this indemnification is not subject to any time or dollar amount limitations 
upon service of a complaint in one of these cases  we tender it to the prior owner or operator 
none of the complaints in these cases state the amount of damages being sought 
the prior owner or operator accepts responsibility for the conduct of the defense of the cases and payment of any amounts due to the claimants 
in our eleven year experience with tendering these cases  we have not made any payment with respect to any tendered asbestos cases 
we believe that the prior owners or operators have the intention and ability to continue to honor their indemnities  although we cannot assure you that they will continue to do so or that we will not be liable for these cases if they do not 
the following table presents for the periods indicated certain information about cases for which service has been received that we have tendered to the prior owner or operator  all of which have been accepted 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  tendered during period resolved during period unresolved at end of period we have never made any payments with respect to these cases 
as of december   we had an accrued liability of million relating to these cases and a corresponding receivable of million relating to our indemnity protection with respect to these cases 
we cannot assure you that our liability will not exceed our accruals or that our liability associated with these cases would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
certain cases in which we are a premises defendant are not subject to indemnification by prior owners or operators 
the following table presents for the periods indicated certain information about these cases 
cases include all cases for which service has been received by us 
year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  filed during period resolved during period unresolved at end of period we paid gross settlement costs for asbestos exposure cases that are not subject to indemnification of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the cases for the year ended december  include cases filed against rubicon llc  which became our consolidated subsidiary on january   as follows one case filed during the period  one case resolved during the period and six cases unresolved at the end of the period 
as of december   we had an accrual of million relating to these cases 
we cannot assure you that our liability will not exceed our accruals or that our liability associated with these cases would not be material to our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
antitrust matters we have been named as a defendant in putative class action antitrust suits alleging a conspiracy to fix prices in the mdi  tdi  and polyether polyols industries that are now consolidated as the polyether polyols cases in multidistrict litigation known as in re urethane antitrust litigation  mdl no 
 civil no 
md jwl djw  united states district court  district of kansas  initial order transferring and consolidating cases filed august  other defendants named in the polyether polyols cases are bayer  basf  dow  and lyondell 
bayer has announced that it has entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs 
these consolidated cases are in the early stages of class certification discovery 
the pleadings of the plaintiffs do not provide specifics about any alleged illegal conduct of the defendants and we are not aware of any evidence of illegal conduct by us or any of our employees 
for these reasons  we cannot estimate the possible loss or range of loss relating to these claims  and therefore we have not accrued a liability for these claims 
nevertheless  we could incur losses due to these claims in the future and those losses could be material 
in addition  on february   the antitrust division of the us department of justice served us with a grand jury subpoena requesting the production of documents relating to sales and pricing of tdi  mdi  polyether polyols and related systems 
bayer and lyondell have announced that they have also been served with subpoenas in this matter 
we intend to cooperate fully in this matter

b all per share information has been restated to give effect to the shares issued in connection with the reorganization transaction and our initial public offering of common stock on february  and the shares issued in connection with the exchange of the hmp warrants on march  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are among the world s largest global manufacturers of differentiated and commodity chemical products 
we manufacture a broad range of chemical products and formulations  which we market in more than countries to a diversified group of consumer and industrial customers 
our products are used in a wide range of applications  including those in the adhesives  aerospace  automotive  construction products  durable and non durable consumer products  electronics  medical  packaging  paints and coatings  power generation  refining and synthetic fiber industries 
we are a leading global producer in many of our key product lines  including mdi  amines  surfactants  epoxy based polymer formulations  maleic anhydride and titanium dioxide 
our administrative  research and development and manufacturing operations are primarily conducted at the facilities that we own or lease 
our facilities are located in countries and we employ approximately  associates worldwide 
our businesses benefit from significant vertical integration  large production scale and proprietary manufacturing technologies  which allow us to maintain a low cost position 
we had revenues for the year ended december  and of billion and billion  respectively 
our business is organized around our six segments polyurethanes  advanced materials  performance products  pigments  polymers and base chemicals 
these segments can be divided into two broad categories differentiated and commodity 
our polyurethanes  advanced materials and performance products segments produce differentiated products  and our pigments  polymers and base chemicals segments produce commodity chemicals 
among our commodity products  our pigments business  while cyclical  is influenced largely by seasonal demand patterns in the coatings industry 
certain products in our polymers segment also follow different trends than petrochemical commodities as a result of our niche marketing strategy for such products that focuses on supplying customized formulations 
nevertheless  each of our six operating segments is impacted to some degree by economic conditions  prices of raw materials and global supply and demand pressures 
growth in our polyurethanes and advanced materials segments has been driven by the continued substitution of our products for other materials across a broad range of applications as well as the level of global economic activity 
historically  demand for many of these products has grown at rates in excess of gdp growth 
in polyurethanes  this growth  particularly in asia  has recently resulted in improved demand and higher industry capacity utilization rates for many of our key products  including mdi 
in  the profitability of our polyurethanes and advanced materials segments improved due to increased demand in several of our key industrial end markets  including aerospace  automotive and construction products 
this has allowed us to increase selling prices  which has more than offset increases in the cost of our primary raw materials  including benzene  propylene and chlorine 
the global po market is influenced by supply and demand imbalances 
po demand is largely driven by growth in the polyurethane industry  and  as a result  growth rates for po have generally exceeded gdp growth rates 
as a co product of our po manufacturing process  we also produce mtbe 
mtbe is an oxygenate that is blended with gasoline to reduce harmful vehicle emissions and to enhance the octane rating of gasoline 
see part i 
item business environmental  health and safety matters mtbe developments and part i 
item a 
risk factors for a discussion of legal and regulatory developments that have resulted in the curtailment and potential elimination of mtbe in gasoline in the us and elsewhere 
we have announced the sale of our us butadiene and mtbe business operated in our base chemicals segment  however  the po mtbe operations in our polyurethanes segment are not included in this transaction which is expected to close in mid see part i 
item business recent developments pending sale of us butadiene and mtbe business 
in  we marketed approximately of our mtbe to customers located in the us for use as a gasoline additive 
most of our sales of mtbe to us customers were made pursuant to long term agreements 
during and concluding by the first quarter of  our long term mtbe sales agreements will terminate 
we anticipate that our sales of mtbe in the us will decrease substantially as compared to levels 
nevertheless  we expect to continue to sell a portion of our mtbe into the us market  although not pursuant to any new long term agreements 
we have entered into sales agreements to sell a significant percentage of our mtbe into the latin american market  and we currently believe that we could also sell mtbe relatively efficiently in europe and asia 
nevertheless  as a result of varying market prices and transportation costs  sales of mtbe in markets outside the us may produce lower margins than the sale of mtbe in the us we may also elect to use all or a portion of our precursor tba to produce saleable products other than mtbe 
if we opt to produce products other than mtbe  necessary modifications to our facilities will require us to make significant capital expenditures and the sale of such other products may produce a lower level of cash flow than the sale of mtbe 
in our performance products segment  demand for our performance specialties has generally continued to grow at rates in excess of gdp as overall demand is significantly influenced by new product and application development 
overall demand for most of our performance intermediates has generally been stable or improving  but excess surfactant manufacturing capacity in europe and a decline in the use of lab in new detergent formulations have continued to impair our ability to increase prices in response to higher raw material costs 
eg industry operating rates and profitability have declined sharply during due to additional capacity coming on stream 
historically  demand for titanium dioxide pigments has grown at rates approximately equal to global gdp growth 
pigment prices have historically reflected industry wide operating rates but have typically lagged behind movements in these rates by up to twelve months due to the effects of product stocking and destocking by customers and producers  contract arrangements and seasonality 
the industry experiences some seasonality in its sales because sales of paints  the largest end use for titanium dioxide  generally peak during the spring and summer months in the northern hemisphere 
this results in greater sales volumes in the second and third quarters of the year 
the profitability of our polymers and base chemicals segments has historically been cyclical in nature 
the industry has recently operated in an up cycle that resulted primarily from strong demand reflecting global economic conditions and the fact that there have been no recent north american or european capacity additions 
however  volatile crude oil and natural gas based raw materials costs and a recent weakening in demand could negatively impact the profitability of our polymers and base chemicals segments 
for a discussion of recent developments affecting our company  see part i 
item business recent developments 
outlook we are optimistic about our outlook for and  consistent with industry analysts  we believe that the outlook for the chemical industry is generally positive 
we expect that demand for most of our differentiated products will remain strong but anticipate somewhat softer demand for certain of our commodity products in the first half of we are currently experiencing less volatility in energy and raw material prices  however  we remain concerned that sustained high energy and raw material costs or volatility in such costs may add uncertainty to the chemical industry s profit outlook for we believe that price momentum is generally favorable 
we announced significant price increases for many of our products in the fourth quarter of  and we expect our differentiated products to maintain price momentum in the near term 
we believe that price momentum in our commodities products is less favorable and we expect that the margin weakness that we experienced in the later half of in our european petrochemicals business is likely to continue into early we believe that regional capacity additions in most of our commodity businesses will be limited over the next several years 
we believe that any lingering effects from the us gulf coast storms on logistics and raw material supplies are dissipating and we expect that any further storm related effects will be relatively modest 
we also believe that the supply and demand imbalances created by these storms have largely been resolved as the affected production capacity has now mostly restarted 
we expect continued global gdp growth  but we also believe that sustained high energy costs have the potential to dampen economic growth

ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we believe that ebitda enhances an investor s understanding of our financial performance and our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations with respect to our indebtedness 
however  ebitda should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income  cash flow from operations or other measures of performance as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
moreover  ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation 
our management uses ebitda to assess financial performance and debt service capabilities 
in assessing financial performance  our management reviews ebitda as a general indicator of economic performance compared to prior periods 
because ebitda excludes interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  ebitda provides an indicator of general economic performance that is not affected by debt restructurings  fluctuations in interest rates or effective tax rates  or levels of depreciation and amortization 
accordingly  our management believes this type of measurement is useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period and making certain related management decisions 
ebitda is also used by securities analysts  lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry 
for example  interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure  debt levels and credit ratings 
therefore  the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies 
in addition  the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate 
as a result  effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies 
finally  companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets 
this can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies 
our management also believes that our investors use ebitda as a measure of our ability to service indebtedness as well as to fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
nevertheless  our management recognizes that there are material limitations associated with the use of ebitda in the evaluation of our company as compared to net income  which reflects overall financial performance  including the effects of interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda excludes interest expense 
because we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations 
ebitda also excludes taxes 
because the payment of taxes is a necessary element of our operations  any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations 
finally  ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization expense 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization expense has material limitations 
our management compensates for the limitations of using ebitda by using it to supplement gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than gaap results alone 
our management also uses other metrics to evaluate capital structure  tax planning and capital investment decisions 
for example  our management uses credit ratings and net debt ratios to evaluate capital structure  effective tax rate by jurisdiction to evaluate tax planning  and payback period and internal rate of return to evaluate capital investments 
our management also uses trade working capital to evaluate its investment in accounts receivable and inventory  net of accounts payable 
we believe that net income loss is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that is most directly comparable to ebitda and that cash provided by operating activities is the liquidity measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap that is most directly comparable to ebitda

for further information regarding selling prices and sales volumes  see the discussion of our operating segments below 
gross profit for the year ended december  increased by million  or  as compared with this increase in gross profit  which occurred in our polyurethanes  pigments and polymers segments  was mainly due to higher margins as average selling prices increased more than raw material and energy costs in as compared with the decrease in gross profit in our advanced materials  performance products and base chemicals segments resulted from the impact of the us gulf coast storms which resulted in a loss of sales  repair costs and higher raw material costs 
operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or  as compared with  primarily due to higher foreign currency losses of million 
restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in for further discussion of restructuring activities  see restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs below 
net interest expense for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  as compared with  primarily due to lower average debt balances resulting from the repayment of debt from the proceeds of our initial public offering on february  and operating cash flows  and from lower average interest rates despite higher underlying interest rates on variable rate borrowings 
other expense for the year ended december  increased by million to million from million for the increase was due primarily to a million increase in loss on early extinguishment of debt 
income tax expense increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared with a benefit of million for the same period in increased tax expense was largely due to increased pre tax income 
our tax obligations are affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
the change in income tax expense includes changes in our mix of income and losses  as well as non recurring items of expense and benefit recognized in each year 
the loss from discontinued operations represents the operating results of our tdi business that we sold on july  the loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  includes a loss on disposal of million recorded in the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we adopted fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  and recorded a charge for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle  net of tax of million  of million 
also in the fourth quarter of  we accelerated the date for actuarial measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations from december to november in order to improve internal control procedures by allowing more time to review the completeness and accuracy of the actuarial benefit obligation measurements 
the effect of the change in measurement date on the respective obligations and assets of the plan resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change credit  net of tax  of million

furthermore  in connection with the hllc merger and the admat minority interest transaction  we used cash to reduce indebtedness and  as a result of now having only one primary financed operating entity  we can now more efficiently maintain less cash on our balance sheet 
the decrease in accounts and notes receivable of million was due principally to increased proceeds under our accounts receivable securitization program a r securitization program of approximately million and a decrease in european currency rates  partially offset by generally higher average selling prices 
the increase in inventories of million was primarily a result of higher raw materials and energy costs  partially offset by lower inventory levels and a decrease in european currency rates 
other current assets increased by million related principally to net investments in government securities used to pre fund the dividend payment on mandatory convertible preferred stock 
accounts payable increased by million due mainly to higher raw materials and energy costs  partially offset by a decrease in european currency rates 
accrued liabilities decreased by million due primarily to lower payroll  interest and restructuring accruals 
debt and liquidity during  we completed a series of transactions designed to simplify our consolidated group s financing and public reporting structure  to reduce our cost of borrowings and to facilitate other organizational efficiencies 
on february   we completed our initial public offering of common and mandatory preferred stock that resulted in approximately billion in net proceeds  substantially all of which were used to repay indebtedness

as a result of these transactions  we now operate all of our businesses through hi and substantially all of our debt obligations are obligations of hi and or its subsidiaries 
in addition  these transactions  together with the repayment of debt from cash flow from our operations  reduced total net debt  including outstandings under our off balance sheet a r securitization program  by approximately billion from december  to december  in addition  we reduced our total interest expense by approximately million in the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  and in  we expect our interest expense to be approximately million 
in spite of an increase in us libor during of approximately  our weighted average cost of borrowings decreased approximately from approximately as of december  to approximately as of december  subsidiary debt with the exception of our guarantee of certain debt of hps  our consolidated chinese splitting joint venture  and certain indebtedness incurred from time to time to finance directors and officers insurance premiums as discussed in other debt below  we have no direct debt or guarantee obligations

capital expenditures estimates for during  we expect to spend approximately million on capital projects  including approximately million in capital expenditures on our ldpe facility at wilton  uk we believe that the cost position of our wilton  uk olefins facility uniquely positions it to be the best site of a polyethylene production facility 
while we export approximately one third of our ethylene production each year to continental europe  incurring significant shipping and handling costs  the uk annually imports approximately billion pounds of polyethylene 
we believe this provides an opportunity to capitalize on the low cost operating environment and extensive petrochemical infrastructure and logistics at wilton  as supported by a feasibility study that was conducted with respect to the construction of a world scale ldpe facility at our wilton site 
the ldpe facility will have the capacity to produce approximately million pounds of ldpe annually and is estimated to cost approximately million to construct  net of any grant proceeds obtained 
we have been awarded a grant of million approximately million from the uk government s department of trade and industry to finance a portion of the construction of the ldpe facility

year ended december  compared with the year ended december  capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared with million in the increase in capital expenditures in was largely attributable to increased capital expenditures in hps which were approximately million in compared with approximately million in in addition  we had approximately million of capital expenditures in in our wilton  uk ldpe project as compared with approximately million in during  of the approximately million of capital expenditures in hps  we funded approximately million as equity and the remaining funding of the capital expenditures of hps was financed through equity investments by the other joint venture partners and loans from local chinese lenders 
during  we invested  as equity  approximately million in slic 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  capital expenditures for the years ended december  and december  were million and million  respectively

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
summarized below are our critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generate substantially all of our revenues through sales in the open market and long term supply agreements 
we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue for product sales is recognized when a sales arrangement exists  risk and title to the product transfer to the customer  collectibility is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable 
the transfer of risk and title to the product to the customer usually occurs at the time shipment is made 
revenue related to the licensing of technology is recognized when earned 
revenue arrangements that contain multiple deliverables are evaluated in accordance with eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables to determine whether the arrangements should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated among the separate units of accounting 
long lived assets the determination of useful lives of our property  plant and equipment is considered a critical accounting estimate 
such lives are estimated based upon our historical experience  engineering estimates and industry information and are reviewed when economic events indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the assets 
the estimated lives of our property range from to years and depreciation is recorded on the straight line method 
inherent in our estimates of useful lives is the assumption that periodic maintenance and an appropriate level of annual capital expenditures will be performed 
without on going capital improvements and maintenance  the productivity and cost efficiency declines and the useful lives of our assets would be shorter 
management uses judgment to estimate the useful lives of our long lived assets 
if the useful lives of our property  plant and equipment as of december  were to have been estimated to be one year greater or one year less  then depreciation expense for the year ended december  would have been approximately million less or million greater  respectively 
we are required to evaluate our plant assets whenever events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in the future or when management s plans change regarding those assets  such as idling or closing a plant 
we evaluate impairment by comparing undiscounted cash flows of the related property to the carrying value 
key assumptions in determining the future cash flows include the useful life  technology  competitive pressures  raw material pricing and regulations

the fair value of the australian styrenics assets was determined based on estimated market prices 
during the fourth quarter of  we tested the mtbe assets for recoverability and concluded that these assets were not impaired 
restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs we have recorded restructuring charges in recent periods in connection with closing certain plant locations  work force reductions and other cost savings programs 
these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan 
estimates for plant closing include the write off of the carrying value of the plant  any necessary environmental and or regulatory costs  contract termination and demolition costs 
estimates for work force reductions and other costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated  termination benefits to be provided and other information as necessary 
while management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the initial estimate  management s estimates on a project by project basis have not varied to a material degree 
for further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note restructuring  impairment and plant closing costs to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes 
we evaluate deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
valuation allowances are reviewed each period on a tax jurisdiction by tax jurisdiction basis to analyze whether there is sufficient positive or negative evidence to support a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax assets 
subsequent to acquiring admat in june and through december   substantially all non us operations of admat were treated as branches for us income tax purposes and were  therefore  subject to both us and us income tax 
effective january   admat s foreign operations will no longer be treated as our branches and will not be subject to us taxation on their earnings until those earnings are repatriated to the us  similar to our other us entities 
for non us entities that are not treated as branches for non us tax purposes  we do not provide for income taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries as earnings are reinvested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
as a matter of course  our subsidiaries are regularly audited by various taxing authorities in both the us and numerous us jurisdictions 
we believe that we have made adequate provision for all outstanding issues for all open years 
employee benefit programs we sponsor several contributory and non contributory defined benefit plans primarily covering employees in the us  the us  netherlands  belgium  canada and a number of other countries 
we fund the material plans through trust arrangements or local equivalents where the assets are held separately from the employer 
we also sponsor unfunded postretirement plans which provide medical and life insurance benefits covering certain employees in the us and canada 
amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements are recorded based upon actuarial valuations performed by various independent actuaries 
inherent in these valuations are numerous assumptions regarding expected return on assets  discount rates  compensation increases  mortality rates and health care costs trends 
these assumptions are disclosed in note employee benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
effective in the fourth quarter of  we accelerated the date for actuarial measurement of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations from december to november we believe the one month acceleration of the measurement date is a preferred change as it improves internal control procedures by allowing more time to review the completeness and accuracy of the actuarial benefit obligation measurements 
the effect of the change in measurement date on the respective obligations and assets of the plan results resulted in a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle credit  net of tax of million 
management  with the advice of its actuaries  uses judgment to make assumptions on which our employee benefit plan liabilities and expenses are based 
the effect of a change in three key assumptions is summarized as follows dollars in millions assumptions statement of operations balance sheet impact discount rate increase decrease expected return on assets increase decrease rate of compensation increase increase decrease estimated impact on net periodic benefit cost 
estimated impact on december  additional minimum liability and reduction in stockholder equity 
stock based compensation plans management uses judgment in determining assumptions used in the black scholes valuation model to estimate fair value of its stock based compensation plans 
because we did not have stock based compensation plans prior to our initial public offering of common stock in february  our ability to use historical experience for assumptions related to stock based compensation plans has been limited 
the effect of a change in two key assumptions is summarized as follows dollars in millions assumptions statement of operations balance sheet impact expected volatility increase decrease expected life of stock options granted during the period increase decrease estimated impact on compensation expense 
estimated impact on december  additional paid in capital 
asset retirement obligations management uses judgment in determining assumptions used to estimate the fair value of asset retirement obligations 
estimating the fair value of asset retirement obligations involves assumptions and estimates surrounding settlement dates  methods of settlement  future costs and inflation 
because of the long term  productive nature of our manufacturing operations  deriving estimates of the timing and the methods of settlement  and the costs of settlement require significant levels of judgment based on the facts and circumstances of each asset retirement obligation 
the effect of a change in the inflation rate used to estimate asset retirement obligations is estimated as follows dollars in millions assumptions statement of operations balance sheet impact inflation rate increase decrease estimated impact on cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle 
estimated net impact on december  property  plant and equipment and asset retirement obligation balances 
environmental reserves environmental remediation costs for our facilities are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of environmental reserves require evaluating government regulation  available technology  site specific information and remediation alternatives 
we accrue an amount equal to our best estimate of the costs to remediate based upon the available information 
adjustments to our estimates are made periodically based upon additional information received as remediation progresses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and certain commodity prices 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  from time to time  we enter into various derivative transactions 
we hold and issue derivative financial instruments for economic hedging purposes only 
currency exchange rates our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation 
our sales prices are typically denominated in euros or us dollars 
from time to time  we may enter into foreign currency derivative instruments to minimize the short term impact of movements in foreign currency rates 
where practicable  we generally net multicurrency cash balances among our subsidiaries to help reduce exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
certain other exposures may be managed from time to time through financial market transactions  principally through the purchase of spot or forward foreign exchange contracts generally with maturities of nine months or less 
we do not hedge our currency exposures in a manner that would eliminate the effect of changes in exchange rates on our cash flows and earnings 
our a r securitization program in certain circumstances requires that we enter into forward foreign currency hedges intended to hedge currency exposures 
as of december   our outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts were insignificant 
a significant portion of our debt is denominated in euros 
we also finance certain of our non us subsidiaries with intercompany loans that are  in some cases  denominated in currencies other than the entities functional currency 
we manage the net foreign currency exposure created by this debt through various means  including cross currency swaps  the designation of certain intercompany loans as permanent loans as defined below and the designation of debt and swaps as hedges 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that are not designated as permanent loans as defined below are recorded in earnings 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans that we may designate as permanent because they are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future permanent loans are recorded in other comprehensive income 
from time to time  we review such designation of intercompany loans  and  during the year ended december   we have increased the net amount of our permanent loans 
this has resulted in less volatility reported in foreign currency gains and losses reflected in earnings 
we have outstanding cross currency interest rate swaps of fixed rate debt 
we entered into these swaps with various financial institutions in order to more effectively hedge our overall underlying euro long term net asset and euro cash flow exposures 
in one of the swap transactions  we agreed to swap million of fixed rate debt for million of fixed rate debt 
as a result  we will pay fixed rate interest at an annual rate of on million of principal and will receive fixed rate interest at an annual rate of on million of principal through january  at maturity on january   we are required to pay principal of million and will receive principal of million 
interest installments are paid semiannually on january and july of each year beginning july  through maturity 
the swap is classified as a net investment hedge under us gaap 
in another swap transaction  we agreed to swap million of fixed rate debt for million of fixed rate debt 
as a result  we will pay fixed rate interest at an annual rate of on million of principal and will receive fixed rate interest of on million of principal through july  at maturity  july   we are required to pay principal of million and will receive principal of million 
interest installments are paid semiannually on january and july of each year  beginning july  through maturity 
the swap is not designated as a hedge for reporting purposes under us gaap 
from time to time  we review our non us dollar denominated debt and swaps to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges 
as of december   excluding the cross currency interest rate swaps discussed above  we have designated approximately million of our euro denominated debt as a hedge of our net investments 
interest rates through our borrowing activities  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
such risk arises due to the structure of the our debt portfolio  including the duration of the portfolio and the mix of fixed and floating interest rates 
actions taken to reduce interest rate risk include managing the mix and rate characteristics of various interest bearing liabilities as well as entering into interest rate swaps  collars and options 
we may purchase both interest rate swaps and interest rate collars to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating rate long term debt 
under interest rate swaps  we agree with other parties to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount 
when we enter into collars  the collars entitle us to receive from the counterparties major banks the amounts  if any  by which our interest payments on certain of our floating rate borrowings exceed a certain rate  and require us to pay to the counterparties major banks the amount  if any  by which our interest payments on certain of our floating rate borrowings are less than a certain rate 
interest rate contracts were recorded as a component of other non current liabilities as of december  and the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the swaps are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  with any ineffectiveness recorded in interest expense 
as of december  and  we had entered into various types of interest rate contracts to manage our interest risk on our long term debt as indicated below dollars in millions notional amount fair value cash flow hedges non designated derivatives maturity we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty to the derivative financial instruments 
we anticipate  however  that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy obligations under the contracts 
market risk arises from changes in interest rates 
commodity prices our exposure to changing commodity prices is somewhat limited since the majority of our raw materials are acquired at posted or market related prices  and sales prices for finished products are generally at market related prices which are largely set on a monthly or quarterly basis in line with industry practice 
in order to reduce overall raw material cost volatility  from time to time we enter into various commodity contracts to hedge our purchase of commodity products 
we do not hedge our commodity exposure in a manner that would eliminate the effects of changes in commodity prices on our cash flows and earnings 
at december   we had in place forward purchase and sales contracts for  tonnes and  tonnes  respectively  of naphtha and other hydrocarbons  which do not qualify for hedge accounting
