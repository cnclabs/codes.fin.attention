seasonal store sales data with sales improvements versus the previous comparable period in bold type follow spring fall spring fall spring fall total store sales millions sales per average store s average number of stores comparable store sales excludes sales on the internet and through a catalog that was distributed until march a store that is relocated within the same shopping center or mall is considered comparable 
however  if the store is relocated elsewhere  it is considered a new store and not comparable 
a store that is expanded or contracted is still comparable  ie  the sales from the remodeled store are considered comparable 
stores that are closed are not considered comparable 
the comparable store sales calculation is not adjusted for changes in the store sales return reserve and excludes sales on the internet and through a catalog that was distributed until march store count store counts averaged stores  stores and stores  respectively  for fiscal  and in fiscal  the company opened one store  closed stores and ended the year with stores

other liquidity sources purchases of merchandise directly imported by the company are made in us dollars and generally financed by trade letters of credit 
the company was the importer of record for of its total purchases in fiscal these imports were generally financed with trade letters of credit 
the financing agreement has a term expiring on august  the line of credit is million for the companies  subject to availability of credit as described in the following paragraphs 
the line of credit may be used on a revolving basis by any of the companies to support trade letters of credit and standby letters of credit and to finance loans 
at january   trade letters of credit for the account of the companies and supported by cit were outstanding in the amount of million and standby letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of million 
standby letters of credit were used principally in connection with insurance policies issued to the company 
subject to the following paragraph  the availability of credit within the aggregate million line of credit to any of the companies at any time is the excess of its borrowing base over the aggregate outstanding amount of its letters of credit and its revolving loans  if any 
the borrowing base  as to any of the companies is i the sum of x a percentage of the book value of its eligible inventory both on hand and unfilled purchase orders financed with letters of credit  ranging from to depending on the time of year  y the balance from time to time in an account in its name that has been pledged to the lenders a pledged account and z of certain receivables from credit card companies less ii reserves for rent for stores located in certain states and liens other than permitted liens and  at cit s option  a reserve for sales taxes collected but not yet paid 
the provisions of the preceding paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding  the companies are required to maintain unused at all times combined availability of at least million 
except for the maintenance of a minimum availability of million and a limit on capital expenditures  the financing agreement does not contain any significant financial covenants 
the combined borrowing capacity of the companies is cyclical due to the seasonality of the retail industry 
at january   the combined borrowing capacity of the companies  after satisfying the million minimum availability requirement  was million  the pledged account had a zero balance  no loan was outstanding  and the companies balance sheet cash and cash equivalents of million were unrestricted 
the company has agreed with cit to have its subsidiary  avenue giftcards  inc which issues avenue giftcards  maintain a minimum level of high grade liquid investments  which amounted to million 
these investments were classified as restricted cash on the balance sheet at january  and will fluctuate each quarter in relation to the volume of net issuances of avenue giftcards and merchandise credits during the previous six months 
the volume of net issuances is seasonal 
the line of credit is collateralized by i inventory and its proceeds  ii receivables from credit card companies and iii the balance  if any  from time to time in the pledged account 
the financing agreement includes certain restrictive covenants that impose limitations subject to certain exceptions on the companies with respect to making certain investments  declaring or paying dividends  making loans  engaging in certain transactions with affiliates  or consolidating  merging or making acquisitions outside the ordinary course of business 
the company has drawn on the revolving loan facility under the financing agreement from time to time to meet its peak working capital requirements 
interest is payable monthly based on a day year either at the prime rate plus an incremental percentage up to per annum or at the libor rate plus an incremental percentage ranging from to per annum 
the borrower can select either the prime rate or the libor rate as the basis for determining the interest rate 
in either case  the incremental percentage is determined by the average excess availability 
payments of revolving loans are not required until termination of the agreement unless either the outstanding balance of revolving loans and outstanding letters of credit exceeds the combined borrowing capacity of the companies  in which case the excess would be payable upon demand from cit or a default under the financing agreement arises 
short term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for purchases of merchandise directly imported by the company 
trade credit arises from the willingness of the company s vendors of these products to grant extended payment terms for inventory purchases and is generally financed either by the vendor or a third party factor 
the availability of trade credit depends on the company s having other sources of liquidity  as well 
in particular  credit authorizations by trade creditors focus on the amount of the company s cash and cash equivalents and its borrowing capacity under the financing agreement 
capital expenditures this section and the one that follows provide details about certain uses of cash by the company 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures are budgeted to be million for fiscal  including costs of refurbishing approximately stores and building approximately new stores 
this paragraph constitutes forward looking information under the reform act and is subject to the variables  uncertainties and other risk factors referred to under the caption future results 
principal contractual obligations and certain other commercial commitments the principal contractual obligations of the company and certain other commercial commitments at january  see  also critical accounting policies incurred but not reported claims for personal injuries and medical benefits are summarized in the following charts principal contractual obligations total payments due s omitted payments due by period s omitted less than year years years over years distribution center mortgage fixtures capital leases total certain other commercial commitments total amounts committed s omitted amount of commitment per period s omitted less than year years years over years operating leases trade letters of credit standby letters of credit customs duties bond total the proceeds of the distribution center mortgage were principally used to partially finance the construction cost of the company s national distribution center  which was completed in fiscal the proceeds of the fixture capital leases were principally used to partially finance new store construction in fiscal landlord charges other than rent are not included 
additional landlord charges for taxes  maintenance and similar expenses were equivalent to approximately to of the rent paid historically 
trade letters of credit support company obligations under certain purchase orders for merchandise directly imported for which payment is not yet due 
other purchase orders for products not supported by trade letters of credit represent material commercial obligations  subject to inspection of the products and possible rejection 
pending litigation the company is involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that such litigation and claims  net of reserves  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  annual results of operations or cash flows 
this paragraph constitutes forward looking information under the reform act and is subject to the variables  uncertainties and other risk factors referred to under the caption future results 
meeting cash requirements the company s cash requirements include i anticipated working capital needs  including seasonal inventory financing  ii financing activities  including payments due on its principal contractual obligations and iii investing activities  including costs for refurbishing and building stores and replacing fixtures where appropriate 
during fiscal  the company funded its cash requirements from net cash provided from operating activities 
the company s historical sources of liquidity have been the availability of credit under the financing agreement on a revolving basis and short term trade credit  as well as its cash on hand and net cash provided by operating activities 
the company plans to use the financing agreement for its immediate and future working capital needs 
management believes that the borrowing capacity under the financing agreement  together with cash on hand and current and anticipated cash flow from operations  will be adequate to meet the company s cash requirements for at least the next months 
this section constitutes forward looking information under the reform act and is subject to the variables  uncertainties and other risk factors referred to under the caption future results 
critical accounting policies introduction this section discusses the company s critical accounting policies 
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are affected by the policies followed by management in preparing them 
some accounting policies require difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
among the most important accounting policies of the company that involve such managerial judgments are i the use of the retail method of accounting for inventory  ii the use of estimates of incurred but not reported claims for uninsured damages for personal injuries and workers compensation benefits and for benefits under the company s self insured medical  dental and prescription plans for its associates  as well as future development costs of reported claims collectively  ibnr claims and iii the need for a valuation allowance for the company s nol s  other net deferred tax assets and other tax attributes 
inventory in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company utilizes the retail method  under which a cost to price relationship is developed on the basis of original cost as compared to initial retail selling price 
the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting margins are calculated by applying this cost to price relationship to the retail value of inventories 
consequently  the use of the retail inventory method results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market 
inherent in the retail inventory method are estimates by management on current and future selling value of the inventory 
these estimates  which are described in the following paragraphs  can significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as resulting margins 
in the women s retail specialty apparel industry  sales  especially in businesses that emphasize fashionable merchandise  can vary significantly over time 
sales are volatile because of shifts in consumer spending patterns  consumer preferences and overall economic conditions  the impact of increased competition  variations in weather patterns  fluctuations in consumer acceptance of products  changes in the ability to develop new merchandise  differences in promotional strategies  and movements in consumer confidence levels 
the necessity for managerial estimates based on these variables  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can produce inventory valuations at any point in time that are inexact 
permanent markdowns  when taken  reduce both the price and cost components of inventory on hand  which maintains the established cost to price relationship 
deferred markdowns can result in an overstatement of inventories under the lower of cost or market principle 
accordingly  at the end of each fiscal year  management conducts a thorough review of inventory on hand and  based on management s business judgment  estimates what quantities of current merchandise are in excess of the amounts saleable at historical margin rates 
a markdown reserve is established to reduce to estimated net realizable value the carrying value of excess current merchandise and obsolete categories of merchandise 
the markdown reserves at the end of fiscal  and  respectively  ranged from a low of million to a high of million with the markdown reserve at january  at the high end of the range 
giving effect to these reserves and including import in transit inventories  inventories were stated at million at january   million at january  and million at january  inventories at january  and january  have been revised to include import in transit inventories on a basis consistent with that used in fiscal  see inventory in note to the consolidated financial statements 
recording a reserve reduces the inventory on the company s balance sheet and is charged to the company s cost of sales 
if reserves were overestimated at the end of a period  income for that period would be understated and margins for the beginning of the next period would be higher 
the opposite would be true if reserves were underestimated 
markdown reserves are likely to continue to fluctuate  principally because the market environment is dynamic for the reasons set forth above 
however  a consistent methodology for markdown reserves is one of the company s important accounting objectives 
incurred but not reported claims for personal injuries and medical benefits the company records a liability for ibnr claims  which is based on i the number and size of outstanding claims  ii a comparison between the dates paid claims were incurred and the dates they were paid  iii an analysis of the amounts previously paid  iv projections of inflation in medical costs and v advice from time to time from its insurance broker 
the company has insurance policies with coverage for auto  general liability and workers compensation claims but it remains liable for a self insured retention of million for each auto claim and million for each general liability and workers compensation claim 
the company is self insured for its medical  dental and prescription plans for associates 
the company has stop loss insurance coverage for employee medical claims over million each 
also  there is an aggregate limit for these plans which  at january   was million based on the number of associates participating at that time 
the estimates underlying the liability for ibnr claims are matters of judgment on which insurance experts may differ 
if the outcome of claims made with respect to a fiscal period were to exceed the recorded ibnr liability for that period  the liabilities on the balance sheet would have been understated and income would have been overstated for the period in question 
the opposite would be true if the subsequent outcome were less than the recorded ibnr liability 
to estimate its casualty auto  general liability and workers compensation ibnr  the company uses policy year july maturation factors based on the company s history of claim development the high and low year factors are excluded in arriving at an average 
another possible method would be to use industry maturation factors 
the company believes that industry factors are less reliable because they are broad based 
the use of industry factors would not have changed materially the company s casualty ibnr liability reflected on the balance sheets included in the financial statements contained in this report 
as of january   for example  the use of industry factors would have increased the liability by only approximately million 
the company estimates its health claims ibnr by i dividing the run off amounts claims paid after a policy expired without being renewed by claims paid during the last policy year december and ii applying the resulting percentage to the trailing months of paid claims at the time of the calculation 
an alternative methodology would be to use industry factors 
the company believes that industry factors are less reliable because they are broad based 
the use of industry factors might not have changed materially the company s health claims ibnr liability reflected on the balance sheets included in the financial statements contained in this report 
as of january   for example  the use of industry factors might have increased the liability by only approximately million 
as the use of different estimates would change the ibnr liability recorded materially  a consistent approach to estimating liability for ibnr claims is one of the company s important accounting objectives 
management believes that i the liabilities for ibnr claims reflected in all the balance sheets included in the financial statements contained in this report were fairly stated in all material respects  subject to the uncertainties of litigation and the risk of different than anticipated inflation in medical costs and ii the changes in the liabilities for ibnr claims that might have resulted from the use of industry factors in preparing estimates are not material 
tax valuation allowance in fiscal  and  the company recorded valuation allowances for its nol carryforwards  other net deferred tax assets and other tax attributes in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  management concluded that the future utilization of the company s nol carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets was more likely than not and the company reversed the tax valuation allowance  which was million at the time 
the preceding sentence contains forward looking information under the reform act  which is subject to the variables  uncertainties and other risk factors referred to under the caption future results 
the benefit from income taxes on the fiscal consolidated statements of operations reflects the reversal 
private label credit cards issued by the bank in fiscal  the company and world financial network national bank the bank were parties to a private label credit card program agreement  dated january  the credit card program agreement 
under the credit card program agreement  the bank issued credit cards to eligible company customers who apply to the bank 
net credit sales volume with the bank increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal customers met standards for creditworthiness set by the bank with the approval of the company 
the credit cards issued by the bank were co branded with both the company s avenue service mark and the bank s name 
the credit cards were used only for merchandise and services offered by the company 
credit card holders remitted payments to the bank  generally by mailing personal checks 
the bank also handled all statement processing  payment processing  cardholder customer service and collections from delinquent cardholders 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company did not include the receivable asset created under the credit card program agreement in the company s accounts receivable on its balance sheets because the company had no interest in the customer accounts or receivables 
in this connection  it should be noted that the credit card program agreement stated that i the bank is the sole and exclusive owner of all customer accounts  ii the company has no interest in the customer accounts and iii the bank is the creditor in respect of receivables defined in the credit card program agreement as amounts owed with respect to retail purchases  finance charges  deferred finance charges  other fees and charges for sales tax 
also  depending on the circumstances  the company might not purchase the accounts from the bank upon the expiration of the contractual term 
receivables as defined in the credit card program agreement at the close of the last billing cycle in the fiscal year increased to million at january  from million at january  the credit card program premium reflected in general  administrative and store operating expenses was an amount equal to royalties paid to the company by the bank minus costs charged by the bank 
costs were based on the volume of credit card program processing activities performed by the bank 
general  administrative and store operating expenses were offset in part by premiums received from the bank of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in premiums from the bank was primarily due to increased interest income and customer fees 
royalties were based on program revenues minus receivables written off by the bank and the cost of funds for the program at the one year constant maturities treasury cmt rate plus basis points to be reset every three months 
however  the cmt rate was not less than per annum for the purpose of this calculation 
on november   the credit card program agreement was restated as restated  the amended agreement 
under the amended agreement  the bank will continue the private label credit card program and will issue avenue credit cards that may be used to purchase merchandise and services from united retail incorporated and its designees 
the bank also will continue to administer the credit card program  handling remittances and processing services 
the bank will continue to be the sole and exclusive owner of all customer accounts and the creditor in respect of receivables generated 
however  the company must approve any changes to consumer charges  credit terms and credit criteria related to the accounts from those in effect on the date of the amended agreement 
the bank will pay the company specified percentages of net credit sales and outstanding receivables  respectively 
the company will reimburse the bank  however  for chargebacks and all pass through expenses 
net amounts realized by the company under the amended agreement on average are not expected to be smaller than the premiums previously received under the credit card program agreement 
this paragraph constitutes forward looking information under the reform act and is subject to uncertainties relating to economic trends that may affect the behavior of cardholders and changes in governmental regulations affecting the bank 
the amended agreement became effective january   and shall expire on february  as may be extended  the term unless earlier terminated 
additionally  the term shall automatically extend for successive three year terms unless one party notifies the other at least six months prior to any such extension that it does not wish to extend the amended agreement 
during the term of the amended agreement  united retail incorporated may not  directly or indirectly  make available to customers any credit program or facility that is similar in purpose to the program established under the amended agreement except multi purpose credit  charge  debit or secured cards 
at the expiration of the term  the company shall have the right to purchase the customer accounts from the bank for a price equal to the receivables 
also  the bank shall then have the right to sell the customer accounts to the company at that price if the company commences a private label credit card program either on its own or through another issuer of credit cards 
when the amended agreement is about to expire without being renewed  the company is likely to submit requests for proposals to other banks that issue private label credit cards to retailers customers and to use the banks proposals to evaluate a continuation of the private label credit card program 
there is no assurance  however  that other banks would make proposals to continue the program on terms satisfactory to the company or that the company could finance a program on its own without involving a bank 
the penultimate sentence constitutes forward looking information under the reform act and is subject to possible changes in the sector of the banking industry that issues co branded credit cards to customers of retail chains and in governmental regulations affecting that sector
