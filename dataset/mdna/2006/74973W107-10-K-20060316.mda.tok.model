the net impact of these corrections was a decrease to pre tax income and net income in the amounts of million and million  respectively  for the three months and year ended december  the company s management  with the participation of the chief executive officer and principal financial officer  evaluated the effectiveness of the company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rules a e and d e as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form k 
based on that evaluation  including all matters discussed in item a below  the company has concluded that these controls and procedures are effective 
overview rti international metals  inc conducts its operations in two segments the titanium group and the fabrication distribution group f d 
the titanium group  with primary operations in niles  ohio and canton  ohio  has overall responsibility for the production of primary mill products including  but not limited to  bloom  billet  sheet and plate 
this group also focuses on the research and development of evolving technologies relating to raw materials  melting and other production processes and the application of titanium in new markets 
f d  with operations located throughout the us  europe and canada and representative offices in germany  italy and china  concentrates its efforts on maximizing its profitability by offering value added products and services such as engineered tubulars and extrusions  fabricated and machined components and sub assemblies  as well as engineered systems for energy related markets  accessing the titanium group as its primary source of mill products 
approximately of the titanium group s sales in were to f d 
while of rti s sales in were directed to the commercial aerospace market  approximately of all us titanium production is shipped to this segment 
in  the world economies continued to improve  air traffic demand rose significantly in the commercial aircraft segment and defense spending remained steady  leading to a rebound from in the demand for titanium and specialty metal products 
the diversification offered by f d has allowed management to de emphasize commodity titanium products and move the company up the value chain  as well as pursue growth opportunities through acquisitions 
supply chain management is a capability that is becoming more important in f d s targeted markets and rti intends to enhance this core competency 

table of contents much of the deployed capital within rti relates to inventory  primarily work in process  necessitated by the nature of processing titanium to demanding metallurgical and physical specifications 
however  significant investments in raw materials  such as titanium sponge and master alloys  have also been made in order to insure uninterrupted supply and to accommodate surges in demand 
as a result  management has put in place various goals aimed at optimizing inventory levels and continually monitors appropriate levels of required inventory 
in conjunction with the close monitoring of our working capital position  an emphasis is also made on capital expenditures 
with the exception of when the company acquired rti claro for the sum of million plus  shares of rti stock  capital outlays have been less than depreciation over the past few years 
the cash position at the year end stood at million against million at as for the ultimate disposition of this cash  the rti board of directors regularly considers such options as dividends  stock repurchases in excess of an approved million program  acquisitions or strategic combinations 
given the uncertainty and competitive pressures in the current marketplace  as well as the company s growth strategy  management believes that a net cash position with no long term debt is currently the most desirable capital structure

in september  the doe entered into an agreement with a third party to complete the site remediation 
in december  the doe paid the company a settlement of million  sufficient to cover all expenses incurred by the company as a result of the contract termination 
application of the settlement amount against unpaid claims resulted in a net of tax gain of million in  which was offset by a charge of million related to the impairment of certain assets 
earthline was established in to market site remediation applications on a commercial basis 
with the discontinuance of the larger rmies it was determined that earthline was not viable as a stand alone entity and should also be declared a discontinued operation 
the discontinuance of earthline as an ongoing entity was not related to the settlement agreement and expenses related to the discontinuance of earthline were immaterial 
in december  the company terminated production activity related to its tube mill operations and discontinued its titanium strip product line because of a shortage of skelp from its supplier  which is the key raw material in manufacturing titanium strip 
the company is currently seeking relief from the supplier uniti for its failure to meet contractual delivery requirements of the raw material 
tube mill operations had been reported within the f d reporting segment 
at december  the company impaired certain tube mill assets and provided for certain contingencies which resulted in an after tax charge of million 
this charge and the required balance sheet adjustments were reflected in the net loss from discontinued operations for the period ended december  discontinued operations  in representing the operating results of rmies and earthline showed trade sales in of million 
in and discontinued operations represent the operating results of rmies  earthline and the previously discontinued operations of the tube mill 
trade sales of rmies  earthline and the tube mill equaled million in and million in all amounts in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been reclassified to reflect the discontinued operations

while the costs of compliance for these matters have not had a material adverse impact on the company in the past  it is impossible to predict accurately the ultimate effect these changing laws and regulations may have on the company in the future 
the company continues to evaluate its obligation for environmental related costs on a 
table of contents quarterly basis and makes adjustments in accordance with provisions of statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities and sfas  accounting for contingencies 
given the status of the proceedings at certain of these sites  and the evolving nature of environmental laws  regulations  and remediation techniques  the company s ultimate obligation for investigative and remediation costs cannot be predicted 
it is the company s policy to recognize environmental costs in its financial statements when an obligation becomes probable and a reasonable estimate of exposure can be determined 
when a single estimate cannot be reasonably made  but a range can be reasonably estimated  the company accrues the amount it determines to be the most likely amount within that range

fas r requires the mandatory expensing of share based payments  including employee stock options  based on their fair value 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas r for the fiscal year beginning january  and plans to adopt this pronouncement using the modified prospective method 
the company had previously been expensing restricted stock awards using the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the award and had adopted the disclosure only alternative allowed by sfas for stock options 
the company expects to record stock compensation expense of approximately million and million in the first quarter and for the year ending december   respectively  related to unvested stock awards and stock awards to be granted in under sfas r 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as an operating cash inflow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce the net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot accurately estimate what those amounts will be in the future as they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized for such excess tax deductions were million  million  and million in   and  respectively

acquisitions rti continues to evaluate potential acquisition candidates to determine if they are likely to increase the company s earnings and value 
rti evaluates such potential acquisitions on the basis of their ability to enhance or improve the company s existing operations or capabilities  as well as the ability to provide access to new markets and or customers for its products 
rti may make acquisitions using its available cash resources  borrowings under its existing credit facility  new debt financing  the company s common stock  joint venture partnership arrangements or any combination of the above 
rti did not make any acquisitions during on october   rti acquired all of the stock of claro precision  inc  claro of montreal  quebec  canada 
claro is a manufacturer of precision machined components and complex mechanical and electrical 
table of contents assemblies for the aerospace industry 
the purchase was made with available cash on hand and newly issued common shares 
the aggregate purchase price was million consisting of cash of million less cash acquired of million and  shares of rti common stock with a fair value of million 
the purchase agreement provided for a post closing audit period for adjustments to the purchase price to finalize and determine whether the target equity amount of million existed on the closing date 
the company has subsequently agreed that the target equity amount was achieved and has included million as additional purchase price allocation which was previously excluded  resulting in an increase to goodwill of million 
during the third quarter of  the company concluded its evaluation of pre acquisition contingencies in accordance with sfas  business combinations and determined that the fair value of certain inventories should be reduced by million and goodwill increased by million 
claro operates and reports under the company s fabrication and distribution segment and was reflected in results of operations effective october  critical accounting policies rti s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the amounts recorded for assets and liabilities and resulting revenue and expenses 
management estimates are based on historical evidence and other available information  which in management s opinion provide the most reasonable and likely result under the current facts and circumstances 
under different facts and circumstances expected results may differ materially from the facts and circumstances applied by management 
of the accounting policies described in note of the company s consolidated financial statements and others not expressly stated but adopted by management as the most appropriate and reasonable under the current facts and circumstances  the effect upon the company of the policy of goodwill and intangible assets  long lived assets  income taxes  employee benefit plans  environmental liabilities and certain valuation accounts described below would be most critical if management estimates were incorrect 
generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying values of accounts receivable  duty drawback  property  plant and equipment  goodwill  pensions  post retirement benefits  workers compensation  environmental liabilities and income taxes 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost last in  first out lifo  first in  first out fifo and average cost methods  or market 
inventory costs generally include materials  labor costs and manufacturing overhead including depreciation 
the majority of our inventory is valued utilizing the lifo costing methodology 
when market conditions indicate an excess of carrying cost over market value  a lower of cost or market provision is recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets 
in the case of goodwill and long lived assets  if future product demand or market conditions reduce management s expectation of future cash flows from these assets  a write down of the carrying value of goodwill or long lived assets may be required 
intangible assets were originally valued at fair value with the assistance of outside experts 
in the event that demand or market conditions change and the expected future cash flows associated with these assets is reduced  a write down or acceleration of the amortization period may be required 
intangible assets are amortized over years 
management evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of the reporting units are determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on historical and projected financial information 
the carrying value of goodwill at december  was million and million at december   representing and of total assets  respectively 
management relies on its estimate of cash flow projections using business and economic data available at the time the projection is calculated 
a significant number of assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the discounted cash flow model to forecast operating cash flows  including overall conditions  sales volumes and prices  costs of production  and working capital changes 
the discounted cash flow evaluation is completed annually in the fourth quarter  absent any events throughout the year which would indicate an impairment 
if an event were to occur that indicates a potential impairment  the company would perform a discounted cash flow evaluation prior to the 
table of contents fourth quarter 
at december  and  the results of management s assessment did not indicate an impairment 
long lived assets 
management evaluates the recoverability of property  plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such asset may not be fully recoverable in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in circumstances may include technological changes  changes in our business model  capital structure  economic conditions  or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other items  our assumptions about the estimated undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  the company will recognize an impairment loss 
management applies its best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets  and the fair value of the asset 
income taxes 
the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets is reviewed by management quarterly  giving consideration to all the current facts and circumstances 
based upon their review  management records the appropriate valuation allowance to reduce the net value of the deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
should management determine in a future period that an additional valuation allowance is required  because of unfavorable changes in the facts and circumstances  there would be a corresponding charge to income tax expense 
the future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences was million at december  and million at december  the company has provided a valuation allowance to offset a portion of foreign tax credits and state net operating loss carryforwards see note to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event the company was to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a part of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income as appropriate  in the period in which the determination was made 
employee benefit plans 
included in the company s accounting for its defined benefit pension plans are assumptions on future discount rates  expected return on assets and rate of future compensation changes 
the company considers current market conditions  including changes in interest rates and plan asset investment returns  as well as longer term assumptions in determining these assumptions 
actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of net pension expense or income recorded in the future 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future payments 
in general  the company s liability increases as the discount rate decreases and decreases as the discount rate increases 
the rate was determined taking into consideration a corporate yield model and a dedicated bond portfolio model  as well as considering rates on high quality aaa aa corporate bonds in order to select a discount rate that best matches the expected payment streams of the future payments 
the company reduced its discount rate at december  from to determine its future benefit obligation 
the discount rate at december  was and at december  was 
the discount rate is a significant factor in determining the amounts reported 
a one quarter percent change in the discount rate of used at december  would have the following effect on the defined benefit plans in millions of dollars effect on total projected benefit obligation pbo in millions effect on subsequent years periodic pension expense in millions the company develops the expected return on plan assets by considering various factors which include targeted asset allocation percentages  historical returns  and expected future returns
