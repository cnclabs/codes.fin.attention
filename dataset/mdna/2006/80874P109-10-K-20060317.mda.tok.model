item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background to present a better understanding of the overall business of scientific games corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries together  we  we begin management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a with an overview of our business and major operating segments  including any significant events that have occurred in the periods presented 
we then provide a discussion of our critical accounting policies  including our revenue recognition policy  our valuation of long lived intangible assets and goodwill  our income tax methodology and the use of estimates and assumptions throughout our financial results 
we then present an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and any related party transactions 
we then discuss our results of operations  presenting first an overall view of the financial results of the business as a whole  followed by additional discussion of our operating segments 
we then review our financial condition  explaining changes in our balance sheet and cash flows  along with our outstanding debt  contractual obligations and commitments 
we then detail any new accounting pronouncements and clarify their impact on our financial statements 
the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year traditionally comprise the weakest season for our pari mutuel wagering business 
as a result of inclement weather during the winter months  a number of racetracks do not operate and those that do operate often experience missed racing days 
this adversely affects the amounts wagered and our corresponding service revenues 
pari mutuel and lottery equipment sales and software license revenues usually reflect a limited number of large transactions  which do not recur on an annual basis 
consequently  revenues and operating results can vary substantially from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition for major equipment sales and software licensing transactions 
in addition  instant ticket and prepaid phone card sales may vary depending on the season and timing of contract awards  changes in customer budgets  inventory ticket levels  lottery retail sales and general economic conditions 
operating results may also vary significantly from period to period depending on the addition or disposition of business units in each period 
the acquisition of mdi entertainment  inc mdi in january  the acquisition of oes in november  the acquisition of honsel in december and the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in scientific games latin america sa sgla  all of which were accounted for as purchases  affect the comparability of operations from period to period see note to the consolidated financial statements

the operating results of oes have been included in the company s consolidated operating results since the date of acquisition 
had the operating results of oes been included as if the transaction had been consummated on january   the company s pro forma revenue and net income available to common shareholders for the twelve months ended december  would have been million and million  respectively 
on january   we completed the acquisition of mdi and significantly expanded our offerings of licensed branded products and prize fulfillment and related services 
the mdi acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting and the acquired assets and liabilities have been recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition

valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical performance or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant adverse change in the legality of our business ventures or the business climate in which we operate  and loss of a significant customer 
when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow  using a discount rate equal to our weighted average cost of capital  or by a comparison to third party indications of fair market value 
at december   the net carrying value of our long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill amounted to approximately million 
we performed an annual impairment test for fiscal and in accordance with sfas and no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as of december  or income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years 
the company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is unlikely 
the company accounts for income tax contingencies in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
management estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the more significant estimates made by management involve percentage of completion for contracted lottery and pari mutuel wagering systems  as discussed above  evaluation of the recoverability of assets including accounts receivable  inventories and long lived assets and the assessment of litigation and contingencies  and income taxes 
management specifically evaluates the recoverability of accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  past collection experiences with specific customers  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we do not require our customers to provide collateral for services provided pursuant to our service contracts 
for sales of equipment and wagering systems to international customers we generally require that no less than a significant portion of the amounts to be paid be collateralized by irrevocable letters of credit 
changes in the underlying financial condition of our customers could result in a material impact to our results of operation and financial position 
our inventory consists principally of parts and finished goods to which we provide a reserve for obsolete and slow moving items 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of our reserves by reviewing historical rates of scrap  on hand quantities as compared to historical and projected usage levels  orders for new equipment  and contractual requirements to service our installed base of equipment 
we record a liability pertaining to pending litigation based on our best estimate of a probable loss  if any  or at the minimum end of the range of loss in circumstances where the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of uncertainties surrounding the nature of litigation and the ultimate liability to us  if any  we continually revise our estimated losses as additional facts become known 
internal control over financial reporting during  we held a minority equity interest in an incorporated italian consortium which was formed in and began operations in mid that was accounted for under the cost basis of accounting 
subsequent to year end  we determined that because we had a equity interest in an entity of that type  our pro rata share of losses of the consortium in should have been recognized using the equity method of accounting 
an adjustment for this matter along with certain other adjustments related to non routine or complex accounting matters  which in the aggregate were material to the financial statements  were necessary to fairly present the financial statements for the year ended december  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
as a result  when we assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of december   we had a material weakness in the design of internal controls because we had insufficient personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function to resolve non routine or complex accounting matters  such as the treatment of the italian consortium 
in  we remediated our material weakness in the design of internal controls over financial reporting 
we added additional personnel resources to our financial staff and established a review process that addresses current and future complex and standard accounting issues that affect our business 
we also improved our accounting research abilities by subscribing to multiple accounting resources and publications 
as of december   we believe our internal controls over financial reporting are effective 
related party transactions statement of financial accounting standards no 
 related party disclosures  requires us to identify and describe material transactions involving related persons or entities and to disclose information necessary to understand the effects of such transactions on our consolidated financial statements 
we are not a party to material transactions involving related persons or entities

the company was in compliance with its covenants as of december  and for all of the quarters included in the fiscal year our contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness and future minimum operating lease obligations  as set forth in the table below cash payments due by period total within year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt  notes long term debt  notes long term debt  term b loan other long term debt interest expense operating leases other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations the convertible debentures are due however  these convertible debentures could require cash payment before that date if holders of these convertible debentures elect to convert the convertible debentures when the market price of our common stock equals or exceeds  subject to certain conditions  if we call the convertible debentures for redemption  or upon certain corporate transactions 
based on rates in effect at december  because of the uncertainty as to the timing of such payments  we have excluded cash payments related to our contractual obligations for our pension plans and deferred compensation plans of approximately million at december  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million  but no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility  leaving us with a total availability of million as compared to million at december  our ability to borrow under the facility will depend on our remaining in compliance with the limitations imposed by our lenders  including the maintenance of the specified financial covenants 
in august  we paid cash of million  including a million redemption premium  to redeem all of the remaining senior subordinated notes due in august  the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock converted all outstanding shares into shares of our class a common stock and we redeemed their holdings of our series b preferred stock for a nominal amount 
prior to conversion  our series a convertible preferred stock required dividend payments at a rate of per annum 
prior to  we satisfied the dividend requirement using additional shares of convertible preferred stock 
from march until conversion in august  we paid the dividend in cash 
our pari mutuel wagering and online lottery systems service contracts require us to  among other things  maintain the central computing system and related hardware in efficient working order  provide added software functionality upon request  provide on site computer operators  and furnish necessary supplies 
our primary expenditures associated with these services are personnel and related costs  which are expensed as incurred and are included in operating expenses services in the consolidated statements of income 
historically  the revenues we derive from our pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems service contracts have exceeded the direct costs associated with fulfilling our obligations thereunder 
we expect that we will continue to realize positive cash flow and operating income as we extend or renew existing service contracts 
we also expect that we will enter into new contracts that are accretive to our cash flow 
in addition  through advancements in technology  we are continually deploying more efficient and cost effective methods for manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers 
we expect that technological efficiencies will continue to positively impact our future cash flows and operating results 
we are not party to any other material short term or long term obligations or commitments pursuant to these service contracts 
periodically  we bid on new pari mutuel and online lottery contracts 
once awarded  these contracts generally require significant up front capital expenditures for terminal assembly  customization of software  software and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration 
historically we have funded these up front costs through cash flows generated from operations  available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our ability to continue to procure new contracts will depend on  among other things  our then present liquidity levels and or our ability to borrow at commercially acceptable rates to finance the initial up front costs 
once operational  long term service contracts have been accretive to our operating cash flow 
the actual level of capital expenditures will ultimately largely depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
furthermore  our pari mutuel wagering network consists of approximately  wagering terminals 
periodically  we elect to upgrade the technological capabilities of older terminals and replace terminals that have exhausted their useful lives 
we presently have no commitments to replace our existing terminal base  and our obligation to upgrade the terminals is discretionary 
servicing our installed terminal base requires that we maintain a supply of parts and accessories on hand 
we are also required  contractually in some cases  to provide spare parts over an extended period of time  principally in connection with our systems and terminal sale transactions 
to meet our contractual obligations and maintain sufficient levels of on hand inventory to service our installed base  we purchase inventory on an as needed basis 
we presently have no inventory purchase obligations  other than in the ordinary course of business 
at december   our available cash  short term investments and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at december  the amount of our available cash and short term investments fluctuates principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems contracts  borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities and changes in our working capital position 
the decrease in our available cash from the december  level principally reflects the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  of million  offset by wagering and other capital expenditures and other investing activities totaling million  acquisition related payments of million and million of payments on long term debt 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities is derived from million of net cash provided by operations coupled with million provided by changes in working capital 
the working capital changes occurred principally from decreases in short term investments  along with increases in accounts payable  offset by increases in accounts receivable  inventories  other current assets and decreases in accrued liabilities 
capital expenditures of million in the year ended december  are greater than similar expenditures totaling million in the corresponding period in wagering system expenditures  including software expenditures  totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in this increase is primarily due to the new lottery contracts in puerto rico  spain  mexico  oklahoma and colorado 
cash flow from financing activities principally reflects the repayments of borrowings under the facility 
at december   our available cash  short term investments and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at december  our available cash  short term investments and borrowing capacities fluctuate principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems contracts  repayment of our outstanding debt and changes in our working capital position 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities of million exceeded cash used in investing activities of million  excluding funds used for acquisitions and debt financing fees 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities is derived from net cash provided by operations of million less million that was used to fund changes in working capital 
the working capital changes occurred principally from decreases in accrued liabilities and increases in short term investments  partially offset by increases in accounts payable 
capital expenditures of million in increased million from the prior year primarily due to the build out of the alpharetta  georgia facility and the purchase of a short run printing press 
wagering systems expenditures of million in  increased million from the prior year primarily due to new online lottery contracts in colorado and puerto rico 
cash flow from financing activities of million reflects the december financing transactions discussed above  plus million of borrowings under our facility less a net payment of million for the bond hedge transaction 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowing capacity under the facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs  including anticipated capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
while we are not aware of any particular trends  our contracts periodically renew and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in sustaining our cash flow from operations through renewal of our existing contracts or through the addition of new contracts 
in addition  lottery customers in the united states generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with each state contract 
our ability to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms is subject to prevailing market conditions  which may be impacted by economic and political events 
although we have not experienced any difficulty obtaining such bonds  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
while we are not aware of any reason to do so  if we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  or provide letters of credit or cash in lieu of performance bonds  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
further  the terms of the indenture governing the convertible debentures give holders the right to convert the convertible debentures when the market price of our class a common stock exceeds a defined target market price 
the terms of such indenture require us to pay cash for the face amount of the convertible debentures which have been presented for conversion  with the value of the difference between the stated conversion price and the prevailing market price payable by our issuance of additional shares of our class a common stock 
we cannot offer any assurance that we will have sufficient available cash to pay for the convertible debentures presented to us for conversion nor can we offer any assurance that we will be able to refinance all or a portion of the converted convertible debentures at that time 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r would require the measurement of all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r was originally effective for periods beginning after june   however  in april  the securities and exchange commission sec changed the effective date of sfas no 
r to fiscal years beginning after june  for non small business issuers 
sfas no 
r provides alternative methods of adoption  which include prospective application and a modified retroactive application 
we will adopt sfas r on january  using the modified prospective transition method 
under modified prospective application  fas r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the required effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the required effective date shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the required effective date 
based on the grants issued prior to january  and are unvested at january   we anticipate recognizing share based compensation expense in of approximately million 
the total share based compensation expense in the financial statements cannot be predicted at this time because we expect to continue our policy of granting share based payment awards in the future 
based on this policy  the approximated value should increase throughout the year based on the number of shares awarded 
sfas r also requires that the classification of tax benefits associated with exercising stock options will change from an operating cash flow activity to a financing cash flow activity 
this will reduce our net operating cash flows and increase the net financing cash flows in we cannot estimate the impact on the cash flow statement as it is dependent on the amount and timing of employee stock option exercises 
in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas and requires a liability to be recorded if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
the types of asset retirement obligations that are covered by fin are those for which an entity has a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity  however  the timing and or method of settling the obligation are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective no later than fiscal years ending after december  we have applied the guidance of fin  which did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our products and services are sold to a diverse group of customers throughout the world 
as such  we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as a result of changes in general economic conditions  sources of supply  competition  foreign exchange rates  tax reform  litigation and regulatory developments 
the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes from any single event would materially affect our financial position 
additionally  as a result of the diversity of our customer base  we do not consider ourselves exposed to concentration of credit risks 
these risks are further minimized by setting credit limits  ongoing monitoring of customer account balances  and assessment of the customers financial strengths 
inflation has not had an abnormal or unanticipated effect on our operations 
inflationary pressures would be significant to our business if raw materials used for instant lottery ticket production  prepaid phone card production or terminal manufacturing are significantly affected 
available supply from the paper and electronics industries tends to fluctuate and prices may be affected by supply 
for fiscal  inflation was not a significant factor in our results of operations  and we were not impacted by significant pricing changes in our costs  except for personnel related expenditures 
we are unable to forecast the prices or supply of substrate  component parts or other raw materials in  but we currently do not anticipate any substantial changes that will materially affect our operating results 
in certain limited cases  our lottery contracts with our customers contain provisions to adjust for inflation on an annual basis  but we cannot be assured that this adjustment would cover raw material price increases or other costs of services 
while we have long term and generally satisfactory relationships with most of our suppliers  we also believe alternative sources to meet our raw material and production needs are available 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and equity market risks as we seek debt and equity capital to sustain our operations 
at december   approximately of our debt was in fixed rate instruments 
the fair value of all financial instruments is approximately million higher than the carrying value at year end 
the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
see liquidity  capital resources and working capital 
principal amount by expected maturity average interest rate december  there after total fair value dollars in thousands long term debt fixed interest rate interest rate variable interest rate average interest rate we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in the united kingdom  germany  ireland  france  austria  luxembourg  bermuda  peru  spain and chile 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term investments 
accordingly  we do not hedge these net investments 
translation gains and losses historically have not been material 
we manage our foreign currency exchange risks on a global basis by one or more of the following i securing payment from our customers in us dollars  when possible  ii utilizing borrowings denominated in foreign currency  and iii entering into foreign currency exchange contracts 
in addition  a significant portion of the cost attributable to our foreign operations is incurred in the local currencies 
we believe that a adverse change in currency exchange rates would not have a significant adverse effect on our net earnings or cash flows 
we may  from time to time  enter into foreign currency exchange or other contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain firm sales commitments  anticipated revenue streams and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments are in high quality securities placed with a wide array of institutions with high credit ratings 
this investment policy limits our exposure to concentration of credit risks
