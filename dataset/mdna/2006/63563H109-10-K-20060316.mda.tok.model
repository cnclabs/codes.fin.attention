overview we own and operate dental laboratories located in states  serving an active customer base of over  dentists 
our business consists of the design  fabrication  marketing and sale of custom dental prosthetic appliances for dentists located primarily in the domestic marketplace 
our products are grouped into the following three main categories restorative products 
restorative products that our dental laboratories sell consist primarily of crowns and bridges 
a crown replaces the part of a tooth that is visible  and is usually made of gold or porcelain 
a bridge is a restoration of one or more missing teeth that is permanently attached to the natural teeth or roots 
in addition to the traditional crown  we also make porcelain jackets  which are crowns constructed entirely of porcelain  onlays  which are partial crowns which do not cover all of the visible tooth  and precision crowns  which are restorations designed to receive and connect a removable partial denture 
we also make inlays  which are restorations made to fit a prepared tooth cavity and then cemented into place 
reconstructive products 
reconstructive products sold by our dental laboratories consist primarily of partial dentures and full dentures 
partial dentures are removable dental prostheses that replace missing teeth and associated structures 
full dentures are dental prostheses that substitute for the total loss of teeth and associated structures 
we also sell precision attachments  which connect a crown and an artificial prosthesis  and implants  which are fixtures anchored securely in the bone of the mouth to which a crown  partial or full denture is secured by means of screws or clips 
cosmetic products 
cosmetic products sold by our dental laboratories consist primarily of porcelain veneers and ceramic crowns 
porcelain veneers are thin coverings of porcelain cemented to the front of a tooth to enhance personal appearance 
ceramic crowns are crowns made from ceramic materials that most closely replicate natural teeth 
we also sell composite inlays and onlays  which replace silver fillings for a more natural appearance  and orthodontic appliances  which are products fabricated to move existing teeth to enhance function and appearance 
internal sales growth was relatively flat from to  when we made note that the economic climate appeared to be impacting the dental laboratory industry 
we believe that many patients and dentists have postponed optimal treatment plans  such as crowns  and have been pursuing less expensive alternatives such as amalgam fillings  for which we recognize no revenue 
the general economic conditions affecting our operations in the dental laboratory industry have remained less than favorable as consumers continue this conservative practice 
in  we experienced internal sales growth of  which included selling price increases during the period ranging from to at various laboratories and on various product lines and therefore indicates a decline in unit volume 

table of contents we believe that the market available for domestic dental laboratories has stopped growing and has begun to shrink as competition from offshore laboratories  primarily located in china  makes inroads into the low margin segment of the industry  and that this trend is impacting domestic industry growth 
in addition  we face growing competition from technology based solutions that allow dentists to fabricate their own restorations without the use of a dental lab 
the main components of costs for us are labor and related employee benefits 
over the last few years  competition for labor resources as well as increases in medical insurance premiums has driven these costs higher 
we continually review and adjust staffing levels as appropriate at each of our locations while recognizing the need to maintain an available and properly trained workforce 
in we experienced cost pressure resulting from the implementation expenditures necessary to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
due in large part to the decentralized nature of our business  approximately half of our laboratories are subject to detailed onsite testing 
the scope and complexity of our section project required us to engage the accounting firm of deloitte and touche  llp 
in addition  external audit fees for pricewaterhousecoopers  llp were significantly higher than in the prior years 
the impact of these various section implementation costs on earnings in was approximately  or approximately per diluted share  net of taxes  with most of that occurring in the fourth quarter 
for the year ended december   the cost of maintaining our compliance with section was approximately  or approximately per diluted share  net of taxes 
we believe that these compliance costs will continue to decrease  although significant ongoing expenditures will be required to maintain our efforts within the internal controls framework required by the sarbanes oxley act 
we have also continued to pursue an acquisition strategy  which has played an important role in helping us increase sales from  in to  in beginning in we recognized acquired customer relationships and trade names as intangible assets which require the recognition of amortization expense for the customer relationships and impairment testing for the trade names 
on a prospective basis  amortization expense will increase based upon our acquisition activity 
the amount recognized for customer relationships and subsequent amortization expense will be dependent upon the expected profitability and customer retention characteristics of the acquired businesses 
amortization expense for customer relationships was  in and  in  while impairment expense was  in and  in effective march  we completed our largest acquisition to date  green dental laboratories  inc green 
green is notable for several reasons 
we believe that the synergies created by the addition of this laboratory will create value for the organization as a whole 
annualized sales at green are expected to approximate  making green our largest laboratory 
green is treated as a separate operating segment for reporting purposes and will retain a separate company identity as a wholly owned subsidiary 
in order to finance the purchase of green  we borrowed approximately  in long term debt and as a result  are more highly leveraged than we were prior to the green acquisition 
interest expense has therefore become a more significant component of our pre tax earnings 
interest expense in  net of capitalized interest of  was  compared to  in the earnings performance of green and other recent acquisitions have allowed us to increase our sales and gross margin significantly 
for the year ended december   net sales increased  or with  attributable to acquisitions  measured by business at dental laboratories owned less than one year 
for the year ended december   gross profit increased  or  with  attributable to acquisitions 
for the year ended december   approximately of the growth in sales and of the growth in gross profit was attributable to recent acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital decreased from  at december  to  at december   primarily as a result of increased capital expenditures 
additions to property  plant and equipment  were  for the year ended december   significantly more than the  spent for the year ended december   primarily resulting from expenditures related to new facilities 
in we purchased a replacement facility for our dental laboratory in houston  texas at a cost of  during the second half of  we completed the related build out project 
the cost of these building improvements was approximately  and the new facility was placed in service in november  
table of contents cash and cash equivalents decreased  from  at december  to  at december  operating activities provided  in cash flow for the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december   an increase of  this increase was primarily attributable to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  primarily due to timing differences related to payroll and related benefits of approximately  and increased net income and adjustments for depreciation and amortization of  offset by increases in inventories of  due primarily to increases of  in raw materials and  in work in process inventories due to increased production volume 
cash outflows related to dental laboratory acquisitions  including deferred purchase price payments associated with prior period acquisitions  totaled  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of green 
we executed a financing agreement the agreement with fleet national bank  now known as bank of america  na the bank 
the agreement  dated june   included a revolving line of credit of  and a revolving acquisition line of credit of  the interest rate on both revolving lines of credit was the prime rate or  at our option  the london interbank offered rate libor  or a cost of funds rate plus a range of 
to depending on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth 
both revolving lines of credit were to terminate on june  an unused facility fee of one eighth of per annum was payable on the unused amount of the first revolving line of credit 
a facility fee of  per year was required on the acquisition line of credit 
on august  the agreement was superseded by an amended and restated agreement the amended agreement with the bank  adding a five year credit facility in the form of a term loan in the principal amount of  accordingly  amounts previously borrowed under the revolving acquisition line of credit were repaid under the term loan facility  creating  of availability under the acquisition line of credit 
additionally  certain terms and conditions of the original agreement were amended 
the interest rate on both revolving lines of credit and the term loan is now the prime rate or  at our option  libor  a cost of funds rate  or the bank s fixed rate plus a range of to depending on the ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated ebitda  as defined in the amended agreement 
the amended agreement requires monthly payments of principal  based on a seven year amortization schedule  with a final payment due on the fifth anniversary of the amended agreement 
the amended agreement requires compliance with certain covenants  including the maintenance of specified net worth and other financial ratios 
as of december   the full  was available under the first line of credit and the full  was available under the acquisition line of credit 
december  total long term debt less current maturities long term debt  less current portion the table below reflects the expected repayment terms associated with this new term loan facility at december  the interest rate associated with our current borrowings as of december  is 
principal due fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal total we believe that cash flow from operations and available financing will be sufficient to meet contemplated operating and capital requirements and deferred payments associated with prior acquisitions for the foreseeable future 

table of contents commitments and contingencies the following table represents a list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period less than greater than total year years years years term loan facility interest expense operating leases real estate vehicles equipment laboratory purchase obligations contingent laboratory purchase price total in august  we converted borrowings on the acquisition line of credit to our new term loan facility 
bank borrowings on the term loan facility  net of the current portion of long term debt are classified as long term debt on the balance sheet 
interest expense related to the term loan facility has been projected using the interest rate associated with current borrowings 
we are committed under various non cancelable operating lease agreements covering office space and dental laboratory facilities  vehicles and certain equipment 
certain of these leases also require us to pay maintenance  repairs  insurance and related taxes 
laboratory purchase obligations totaling  classified as deferred acquisition costs  are presented in the liability section of the balance sheet 
these obligations  including deferred obligations associated with non competition agreements  represent purchase price commitments arising from dental laboratory acquisitions  irrespective of the acquired laboratory s earnings performance 
contingent laboratory purchase price includes amounts subject to acquisition agreements that are tied to laboratory earnings performance  as defined within the acquisition agreements  generally over a three year period 
as payments become determinable  they are recorded as goodwill 
as sponsor of the national dentex corporation dollars plus plan  the plan  a qualified plan under section a of the internal revenue code  we have filed a retroactive plan amendment under the internal revenue service s voluntary correction program to clarify the definition of compensation in the plan 
based on our consultation with our erisa counsel  we believe this issue will be favorably resolved without requiring additional employer contributions or jeopardizing the tax qualified status of the plan 

table of contents results of operations beginning in  our results are reported within two operating segments  ndx laboratories and green 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net sales represented by certain items in our consolidated financial statements years ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other expense interest expense income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   net sales increased  or over the prior year 
net sales increased by approximately  as a result of acquisitions  measured by business at dental laboratories owned less than one year  including  attributable to green 
net sales increased approximately  or at dental laboratories owned for both the year ended december  and the comparable year ended december   primarily due to price increases approximating  offset by a decline in the total number of units sold of an estimated 
cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased by  or in the fiscal year ended december  over the prior fiscal year  attributable primarily to increased units due to acquired sales 
as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold decreased from to 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of green s higher margins on consolidated results 
green produced a gross profit of  compared to a gross profit of for the ndx laboratories 
green s scale of operations within a single location provides efficiencies in overhead costs and greater labor productivity  offset by higher materials costs due to product mix variables 
labor productivity improvements as a percentage of sales helped improve our gross margin  offsetting increases in employee health insurance costs 
as a percentage of sales  labor and related benefits declined from in to in green s labor costs of lowered the overall percentage and the portion attributable to ndx laboratories declined to the cost of raw materials as a percentage of sales declined from in to in during the fourth quarter of  the cost of precious metals  including gold and palladium which are components of many dental alloys  increased approximately and  respectively  over costs experienced in the prior nine months 
although we are able to pass metal cost increases on to our customers  prolonged higher metal costs will have a negative impact on gross profit percentages 
selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses  which consist of selling  delivery and administrative expenses both at the laboratory and corporate level  increased by  or in the year ended december  compared to operating expenses increased as a percentage of net sales from in to in as a percentage of 
table of contents sales  administrative  delivery and selling expenses in were materially consistent with the largest increases were related to administrative expenses at the corporate level and increased laboratory incentive compensation resulting from improved earnings performance 
the increase of  was primarily attributable to the following increases  offset by a decrease in trade name impairment expense of  additional operating and amortization expense associated with acquisitions completed in  increases in salaries and benefits at the corporate and lab level  in part due to the addition of financial and management staff and increases in health insurance  increases in consulting expenses and professional fees  including audit and compliance costs  increases in laboratory incentive compensation as a result of improved laboratory profit performance  increases in depreciation and maintenance costs related to computer systems and software  increases in bad debt expense associated with credit risk in our receivables portfolio  increases in training and recruiting expenses  and increases in delivery costs  including additional salaries and cost increases related to higher fuel prices  operating income as a result of the above factors  our operating income increased by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income increased from in to in interest expense net interest increased  from  in to  in  primarily as a result of a bank borrowings to fund the acquisition of green 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased by  to  in from  in the effective tax rate for fiscal year decreased to for fiscal year the decrease in effective tax rate for was due in part to recognition of lower federal tax expense resulting from the domestic manufacturing tax credit provisions of the american jobs creation act of net income as a result of all the factors discussed above  net income increased  to  or per share on a diluted basis in from  or per share on a diluted basis in year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   net sales increased  or over the prior year 
net sales increased by approximately  as a result of acquisitions  measured by business at dental laboratories owned less than one year 
net sales increased approximately  or at dental laboratories owned for both the year ended december  and the comparable year ended december  
table of contents cost of goods sold our cost of goods sold increased by  or in the fiscal year ended december  over the prior fiscal year  attributable primarily to increased unit sales 
as a percentage of sales  cost of goods sold decreased slightly from to 
component percentages  such as labor and benefits and materials expenses  remained virtually unchanged from the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses  which consist of selling  delivery and administrative expenses both at the laboratory and corporate level  increased by  or in the year ended december  compared to operating expenses increased as a percentage of net sales from in to in as a percentage of sales  selling expenses declined while administrative expenses at the corporate level rose sharply in compared to the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of required us to engage the services of deloitte and touche  llp 
deloitte provided internal control design consultation and testing services as well as project management to help us meet our compliance obligations 
additionally  external audit fees rose sharply in connection with the sarbanes oxley reporting requirements 
as a result of these factors  we incurred an additional  in administrative costs 
beginning in  we revised our classification of certain intangibles acquired through current and prior period business combinations 
specifically  the recognition of value as assigned to customer relationship intangibles resulted in amortization expense of approximately  additionally  we recorded a charge of  to recognize impairment of acquired trade names 
selling costs declined as a percentage of sales as spending on the ndx reliance program tm  our national marketing program  was reduced from  in to  in however  we continued to invest in local marketing efforts and our local marketing costs increased from  in to  in operating income as a result of lower than expected internal sales growth  attributable in part to a continued lackluster economic climate affecting consumer decisions on dental work  additional amortization expense and increases in compliance and audit expenses discussed above  offset partially by increased operating income associated with acquisitions  our operating income declined by  to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  operating income declined from in to in interest expense net interest increased  from interest income of  in to interest expense of  in  primarily as a result of a reduction in available cash coupled with the use of the line of credit to fund dental laboratory acquisitions 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased by  to  in from  in the effective tax rate for fiscal increased to for fiscal the effective tax rate for was lower due to the finalization of certain permanent tax benefits

as released by the sec requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
the preparation of our 
table of contents consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
a summary of certain of our significant accounting policies is presented below 
summary of significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss  generally as the dentists orders are shipped 
commencing in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we have recorded shipping and handling fees charged to customers as revenues in accordance with eitf accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
prior to the fourth quarter  these fees were recorded as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses 
the effect of recording these fees as reductions to selling general and administrative expenses was not material 
shipping and handling costs totaled approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal  and are included in selling  general and administrative expense 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets not subject to amortization in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill amortization ceased on december  we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that the value of goodwill has been impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is evaluated for possible impairment on an annual basis  based on a two step process 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential impairment 
the second step  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
we view the individual laboratories as reporting units 
we determine fair value using factors based on revenue and operating margins 
in the second quarter of  and we completed the impairment testing and determined that no impairment existed 
additionally  we also recognize the existence of value in trade names acquired in business combinations and believe the useful life of this intangible to be indefinite 
accordingly  trade names are also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis using a single step method in accordance with sfas no 
impairment charges related to trade names are recognized when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the asset 
impairment charges related to trade names were recorded in the year ended december  in the amount of  of which  an immaterial amount  relates to prior periods 
impairment charges of  were recorded in the year ended december  trade name impairment charges generally result from a decline in forecasted revenue at specific laboratories in comparison to revenue forecasts used in previous valuation calculations 
intangible assets subject to amortization we follow the applicable accounting pronouncements specifically sfas no 
business combinations and emerging issues task force abstract recognition of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in a business combination eitf  in accounting for purchase business combinations 
non competition agreements and customer relationship intangibles arising from dental laboratory acquisitions are amortized over their useful lives 
the acquisition date fair value of non competition agreements are deferred and amortized over their economic useful lives  in accordance with the terms of the agreements  ranging from to years 
the acquisition date fair value associated with acquired customer relationships are amortized over their estimated economic useful life  ranging from to years 
inventories inventories  consisting principally of raw materials  are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we use estimates based on specific identification to maintain proper reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
additionally  we estimate work in process inventories by applying current labor  materials and selected overhead expense rates to standard production schedules 
we estimate the value of unrefined precious metal scrap based on 
table of contents the application of various return and refining statistics 
finished goods inventory consists of completed orders that were shipped to customers immediately subsequent to period end 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the following estimated depreciable lives buildings years furniture and fixtures years laboratory equipment years computer equipment years leasehold improvements and capital leases are amortized over the lesser of the assets estimated useful lives or the lease terms 
gains and losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are charged to operations as incurred 
depreciation expense totaled approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal impairment of long lived assets at each balance sheet date  management evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets  using certain financial indicators  such as historical and future ability to generate income from operations 
our policy is to record an impairment loss in the period when it is determined that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
the determination is based on an evaluation of such factors as the occurrence of a significant event  a significant change in the environment in which the business operates or if the expected future cash flows become less than the carrying amount of the asset 
cash surrender of life insurance the cash surrender value of life insurance policies are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
income taxes we follow sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
the amount of deferred tax asset or liability is based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we have considered our current financial characteristics as well as current tax law and do not believe that the recoverability of various tax assets and liabilities is impaired  and therefore have recorded them at their full value

we expect the net effect of the phase out of the eti and the phase in of this new deduction to result in a decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal years and of approximately percentage point  based on current earnings levels 
in the long term  our management expects that the new deduction will result in a decrease of the annual effective tax rate by an amount up to percentage points based on current earnings levels 
under the guidance in fasb staff position no

 accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the act  the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in sfas no 
as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the enactment date 
rather  the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return
