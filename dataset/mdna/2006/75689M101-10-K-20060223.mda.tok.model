item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview all comparisons under this heading among   and refer to the week periods ending december   december  and december   respectively  unless otherwise indicated 
our discussions for the year ending december  refer to a week period 
as of december   we owned and operated  or franchised red robin gourmet burger casual dining restaurants in states and canada  of which are company owned and the remaining of which operate under franchise agreements 
in fiscal  we plan to open new company owned red robin gourmet burger restaurants and we believe our franchisees will open an additional new restaurants 
our primary source of revenue is from the sale of food and beverages at company owned restaurants 
we also earn revenue from royalties and fees from franchised restaurants 
the casual dining restaurant industry has become more complex and challenging in recent years 
challenges include increased competition among casual dining restaurant chains for the guest s discretionary dining dollars  increasing labor and benefit costs  increased energy and petroleum based product prices  changes in the economy and increasing real estate and development costs to build new restaurants 
in light of these complexities and challenges  management is pursuing a disciplined growth strategy that includes the addition of company owned restaurants and increased sales at existing restaurants 
in addition  management is focused on managing restaurant operating costs and building our corporate infrastructure to facilitate our long term growth expectations 
the following summarizes the most significant events occurring or affecting us in company owned restaurant sales 
we increased our company operated restaurant revenues over which reflects increases in both comparable restaurant sales as well as increased revenues from the opening of new company owned restaurants in we consider restaurants as comparable in the first period following five full quarters of operations 
amended line of credit financing 
in december  the company entered into an amended credit agreement to obtain extensions of credit and commitments aggregating million over the next five years 
the credit agreement also allows the company an option to increase the credit facility  subject to lender participation  by up to an additional million  or an aggregate of million  in the future 
this credit agreement provides the company with the flexibility to fund the capital needs of our growing business  and at substantially more favorable rates than under our former facility 
management changes 
during and early  we made changes and additions to our senior executive team including the appointment of a new chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief legal officer and the promotion of other executives to more senior management positions 
in august  we announced the retirement of our then chairman  president and chief executive officer and the resignation of our then senior vice president and former chief financial officer 
these management changes followed an internal investigation conducted by a special committee of the board of directors relating to the use of chartered aircraft and travel and entertainment activities 
net expenses related to this management change of million are reported separately in our consolidated financial statements and results as significant and unusual items 
reduced commodity food costs 
we have generally experienced an improvement in the prices for several categories including hamburger  meats  fresh produce and canned goods 
we expect to continue to benefit from lower commodity prices with offsetting increases in higher fuel surcharges and delivery costs 
increased labor and benefits 
as we have increased our company owned restaurants during  we continue to see increases in labor and related costs  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of restaurant revenue 
the increases include higher hourly and management salaries  and increased health and workers compensation costs related to our self insured benefit programs 
unit data and comparable restaurant sales the following table details restaurant unit data for our company owned and franchise locations for the years indicated 
company owned beginning of period opened during period acquired or assumed from franchisees end of period franchised beginning of period opened during period sold or transferred to company owned closed during period end of period total number of red robin restaurants since december  and through february   we have opened additional company owned restaurants and our franchisees have opened additional franchise restaurants 
we expect to open a total of company owned restaurants during we anticipate that our franchisees will open a total of restaurants during results of operations operating results for each period presented below are expressed as a percentage of total revenues  except for the components of restaurant operating costs  which are expressed as a percentage of restaurant revenues revenues restaurant franchise royalties and fees rent revenue total revenues costs and expenses restaurant operating costs cost of sales labor operating occupancy total restaurant operating costs depreciation and amortization general and administrative franchise development pre opening costs significant and unusual items  net income from operations other income expense interest expense interest income gain on sale of property loss on extinguishment of debt total other expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income certain percentage amounts in the table above do not sum due to rounding as well as the fact that restaurant operating costs are expressed as a percentage of restaurant revenues  as opposed to total revenues 
total revenues in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change restaurant revenue franchise royalties and fees rent revenue total revenues average weekly sales volumes comparable restaurants non comparable restaurants restaurant revenues  which are comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales  increased by million  or from of this increase  million was attributable to our new restaurants opened during  million in additional revenues from non comparable restaurants opened in and  and million from a increase in comparable restaurant sales 
the increase in comparable restaurant sales was driven by a increase in guest counts and a increase in the average guest check 
average weekly sales represent the total restaurant revenue for a population of restaurants in both a comparable and non comparable category for each time period presented divided by the number of operating weeks in the period 
comparable restaurants average weekly sales volumes include those restaurants that are in the comparable base during each period 
at the end of  there were comparable restaurants compared to restaurants in non comparable restaurants included in the average weekly sales calculation include those restaurants that had not yet achieved the five full quarters of operations during the periods presented 
at the end of  there were non comparable restaurants versus in fluctuations in average weekly sales volumes in comparable restaurants reflect the effect of same store sales changes as well as the performance of new restaurants entering the comparable base during the period 
the increase in average comparable weekly sales in was primarily the result of the increase in same store sales growth partially offset by a higher weighting of the less mature restaurants entering the comparable base in the performance of these newer restaurants entering the comparable base reflects the historical ramp up of our restaurants during the early years of operations 
the increase in non comparable average weekly sales is due to the higher average performance of the class of new restaurants compared to the and class of new restaurants 
based on our historical experience  we expect that non comparable restaurants will operate at approximately to of comparable restaurant sales volumes  and increase their performance over time after they enter the comparable base 
growth in restaurant revenue is expected to continue as we open a planned new restaurants in in addition  we will be taking an approximate price increase of which we expect to realize to of this increase in actual revenue increases 
the growth in restaurant revenues in over was driven by million of revenues from the new restaurants opened in  million from other non comparable restaurants opened in and and million from a comparable restaurant sales increase of 
as previously disclosed  during the current fiscal year we changed the manner in which we report costs relating to team member complimentary meals 
this change has no effect on net income 
historically  we reported the complimentary portion of team member meals as restaurant revenues  with a corresponding expense reported in restaurant labor and general and administrative costs 
during the second quarter of  we determined that the complimentary portion of team member meals should not have been recognized as revenues or costs and expenses 
this change results in a decrease in restaurant revenues and a corresponding decrease in restaurant labor and general and administrative costs 
all amounts presented herein have been restated to reflect this change in reporting 
for the year ended december   restaurant revenues decreased by million  and restaurant labor and general and administrative costs decreased by million and  respectively 
for the year ended december   restaurant revenues decreased by million and restaurant labor decreased by million 
franchise royalties and fees which consist primarily of royalty income and initial franchise fees  increased in due primarily to the restaurants opened by our franchisees during our franchisees reported that comparable sales for us and canadian restaurants increased and  respectively 
franchise royalties and fees for increased due to additional franchise restaurants opened during compared to costs and expenses cost of sales in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change cost of sales 
as a percent of restaurant revenue cost of sales  comprised of food and beverage expenses  are variable and generally fluctuate with sales volume 
as a percentage of restaurant revenues  cost of sales improved  due primarily to lower commodity costs as well as menu mix changes to lower costs items and purchasing initiatives designed to reduce food and beverage costs 
these benefits were partially offset by higher freight and delivery charges 
we expect cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenues to improve slightly in  as a result of our price increase 
any expected benefit in commodity prices  however  will most likely be offset by higher freight and delivery charges 
in  cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased to compared to  primarily due to higher commodity costs offset by menu price increases 
labor in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change labor as a percent of restaurant revenues labor costs include restaurant hourly wages  fixed management salaries  bonuses  taxes and benefits for restaurant team members 
labor as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased  as a result of increases related to hourly and salaried labor costs for higher salaries and headcounts at our new and comparable restaurant locations  offset by lower incentive bonuses 
the increase in headcounts is due to the staffing of additional restaurant managers in some of our new restaurants in new markets while higher salaries are the result of higher hourly wages paid in response to minimum wage increases imposed under various state laws 
we also experienced an increase in the cost of employee benefits including workers compensation and group health benefits  which are self insured programs 
we expect to see an increase in labor as a percentage of restaurant revenues during  compared to  to continue at this higher trend due to minimum wage increases and higher insurance costs  as well as due to a heavier weighting on our labor costs from our less efficient new restaurants 
in  labor cost increased primarily due to more restaurants operating in than in labor costs as a percent of restaurant revenue improved due to improvement in controllable labor costs and workers compensation costs partially offset by increased bonus costs 
operating in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change operating as a percent of restaurant revenues operating costs include variable costs such as restaurant supplies  advertising and energy costs  and fixed costs such as service repairs and maintenance costs 
the increase in operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenues reflects higher energy  supplies and repairs and maintenance expenses 
the higher energy costs were experienced through increased rates charged to our restaurants for natural gas and oil based utilities 
supplies expense also reflects higher petroleum based materials costs  fuel surcharges and transportation costs that added to our base supply costs in we expect that supply costs will normalize in and that utility costs will moderate as we exit the cold weather months and we see the impact of the recent reductions in natural gas prices 
in  operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue improved due to leverage from our increased comparable restaurant sales  partially offset by cost pressures in certain supplies and energy related items  such as plastic wrap  fuels and utilities 
occupancy in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change occupancy as a percent of restaurant revenues occupancy costs include fixed rents  percentage rents  common area maintenance charges  real estate and personal property taxes  general liability insurance and other property costs 
our occupancy costs generally increase with sales volume but decline as a percentage of restaurant revenues as we leverage our fixed costs 
occupancy costs increased in primarily due to million of expenses related to our new restaurants opened during the year 
in addition  we also realized modest increases in insurance and percentage rents 
occupancy expense as a percentage of restaurant revenue improved in due to the leverage provided by the increase in restaurant revenues 
occupancy costs as a percent of restaurant revenue improved in primarily due to our increase comparable restaurant sales and the increase in the percentage of free standing restaurants which generally have lower occupancy costs than in line restaurants 
depreciation and amortization in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change depreciation and amortization as a percent of total revenues depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants and corporate assets as well as amortization of franchise rights and liquor licenses 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenues has increased in and primarily due to the addition of new restaurants in and a full year of depreciation related to the restaurants opened in in  depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to the addition of new restaurants in and a full year of depreciation related to the restaurants opened in the increase in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenues is primarily the result of newer restaurants having a higher depreciable costs basis than older restaurants 
general and administrative in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change general and administrative as a percent of total revenues general and administrative costs include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries  bonuses and related employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  office rent  professional and consulting fees and marketing costs 
general and administrative costs increased in primarily due to a million increase for additional headcount  salaries and related costs attributable to supporting our growing restaurant operations 
we also recorded a million increase in legal fees related  in part  to the matters described in part i  item legal proceedings 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in marketing expenses 
during  we plan to continue to add resources to the corporate support and field supervision activities commensurate with the planned openings of new restaurants in and to build infrastructure to facilitate our long term growth strategy 
generally  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase from quarter to quarter during  in particular due to increases in legal fees  but to decline as a percentage of total revenues over time 
our general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to a million increase for additional headcount  higher salaries and related costs attributable to operating more company owned restaurants 
in  we also incurred approximately  of costs to comply with the section internal control requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
these costs were primarily related to professional services and additional independent auditor fees 
franchise development in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change franchise development as a percent of total revenues franchise development costs include the costs of our franchise and operations support teams including salaries and benefits  travel and training expenses 
in addition  costs of our annual leadership conference are also included 
franchise development expenses increased in primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our leadership conference offset by efficiencies and leveraged expenses of our franchise team to support the opening of franchise restaurants 
we anticipate that franchise development cost will continue to be leveraged against increased revenues in as our franchisees begin to provide additional resources to new restaurants openings and training 
franchise development expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained unchanged for compared to franchise development expenses in increased primarily due to the substantially increased size of our franchise development and support teams during the second half of in order to support franchisee restaurant openings and the growing franchise restaurant base 
our franchisees opened restaurants during compared to in pre opening costs in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change pre opening costs as a percent of total revenues average per restaurant pre opening costs pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of the costs of labor  hiring and training the initial work force for our new restaurants  travel expenses for our training teams  the cost of food and beverages used in training  marketing costs  lease costs incurred prior to opening and other direct costs related to the opening of new restaurants 
pre opening costs for  and reflect the opening of  and new restaurants respectively 
although average per restaurant pre opening costs remained relatively flat in from  we generally incur higher pre opening costs  particularly for wages and travel  when we open restaurants in new markets  compared to our established markets 
we expect that pre opening costs will continue to increase in as we open a planned new restaurants  including many in new markets 
significant and unusual items  net on august   we announced the retirement of our then current chairman  president and chief executive officer  and the resignation of our then current senior vice president and former chief financial officer 
these management changes followed an internal investigation commenced during the third quarter of by a special committee of the board of directors relating to use of chartered aircraft and travel and entertainment expenses 
the special committee  which retained independent counsel to conduct the investigation  identified various expenses by our former chairman  president and chief executive officer since that were inconsistent with company policies or that lacked sufficient documentation 
on august   our former chairman  president and chief executive officer entered into a restitution agreement with us  and on august   we received million as reimbursement for these expenses 
in addition  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  we recorded a non cash stock based compensation expense of million 
this expense relates to approximately  stock options the board of directors granted to our former chairman  president and chief executive officer and our former senior vice president and former chief financial officer in may the board of directors accelerated vesting of those stock options in  and our former chairman  president and chief executive officer and former senior vice president and former chief financial officer exercised these options in this accelerated vesting triggered the modification of these awards such that they were revalued based upon the fair value of the underlying stock at the time of the modification 
absent this modification  these stock option awards would have been forfeited upon the retirement of our former chairman  president and chief executive officer and the resignation of our former senior vice president and former chief financial officer 
because under their original terms portions of these awards would not have vested until after these individuals ceased to be employed by us  fasb interpretation no 
requires us to recognize stock based compensation expense in the period of departure in an amount equal to the excess fair value of the underlying stock over the option exercise price at the time of the modification 
interest expense interest expense in  and was million  million and million respectively 
interest expense in was higher due to higher borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and a slightly higher average interest rate of versus in this increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest incurred in the construction of our new restaurants during interest expense declined in due to the early payoff of various real estate and equipment loans during that bore significantly higher interest rates than borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in late  we amended our revolving credit facility to lower the effective interest rates 
however  we believe interest expense will continue to increase as we continue to fund our restaurant unit growth with additional borrowings 
interest income we have historically recognized interest income from outstanding promissory notes from certain shareholders officers 
these notes were paid in full during and we expect interest income to be immaterial in future periods 
loss on extinguishment of debt during  we incurred  of charges related to debt extinguishment  which included a  non cash write off of capitalized debt issuance costs 
there were no similar charges in and provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase was due primarily to increased pre tax earnings 
our effective income tax rate was for  for and for liquidity and capital resources general 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year  primarily due to the company s development and construction of new restaurants  which were partially offset by cash flows provided by operating activities  net borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  as well as proceeds from the exercise of team member stock options and stock purchases 
we generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new or enhance existing restaurants and to reduce borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
financial condition 
the company and the restaurant industry in general  maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories and vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new restaurants and refurbishment of existing restaurants  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
credit facility 
effective december  the company amended its credit agreement to provide for an aggregate amount of million to fund the construction and acquisition of new restaurants  to refinance existing indebtedness  to potentially acquire franchise restaurants  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
in addition  the company has the option to increase the credit facility  subject to lender approval  by up to an additional million 
this agreement replaces our prior facility which was set to mature in may our credit facility is currently comprised of a million revolving credit facility maturing on december  borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at one of the following rates as selected by the company an alternative base rate abr  which is based on the prime rate plus to or a london interbank offered rate libor  which is based on the relevant one  two  three or six month libor  at the company s discretion  plus to 
in addition to the abr and libor loans  the agreement provides for a swing line loan sub facility which allows the company to borrow up to million 
the credit facility also requires the payment of an annual commitment fee based on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the annual commitment rate and the credit facility s interest rates are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries granted liens in substantially all personal property assets and certain real property assets to secure our respective obligations under the credit facility 
as long as the company meets a certain financial leverage ratio  the company will not be required to mortgage or encumber real property assets acquired in the future 
additionally  certain of our real and personal property secure other indebtedness of the company 
at december   we had million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and had letters of credit outstanding against our credit facility of million 
covenants 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our various credit agreements  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  dividend payments  and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
total debt outstanding increased to million at december  from million at december   due to additional borrowings to construct new restaurants and acquire other assets  offset by payments made on capital lease obligations 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other non current liabilities long term debt obligations represent borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and other collateralized notes payable  excluding interest which is based on variable rates 
capital lease obligations include interest of million 
operating lease obligations represent future minimum lease commitments payable for land  buildings and equipment used in our operations 
this table excludes contingent rents  including amounts which are determined as a percentage of adjusted sales in excess of specified levels 
purchase obligations include commitments for the construction of new restaurants and other capital improvement projects and lease commitments for company owned restaurants where leases have been executed but construction has not begun 
other non current liabilities include executive deferred compensation  accrued restaurant bonuses for long term incentive plans  franchise deposits and vendor deposits 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  including capital lease obligations  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash flows used for additions to property and equipment were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
fiscal  compared with fiscal  includes higher expenditures for new restaurants as well as increases in facility improvements 
the increase in cash flows utilized in compared with is primarily due to expenditures for new restaurant construction and remodeling as well as the exercise of three capital lease purchase options 
in fiscal year  capital expenditures are expected to be million to million 
we plan to open approximately new company owned restaurants and plan to continue our investment in restaurant remodels and capital improvements as well as expanding our corporate infrastructure to support our growth model 
future liquidity 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  and for general operating purposes 
in addition  we may use capital in the acquisition of franchise restaurants 
our primary short term and long term sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations and the revolving bank credit facility 
additional potential sources of liquidity to a lesser extent include the issuance of company stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet debt service  capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor costs energy costs and materials used in the construction of new restaurants 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has had a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the current year  due primarily to higher energy costs  higher costs for certain supplies and petroleum based products  higher costs for materials and labor related to construction of our new restaurants and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices for certain foods we purchase at market rates 
uncertainties related to higher costs  including energy costs  commodity prices  wages and construction materials make it difficult to predict what impact  if any  inflation may have on our business during seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season 
as a result  our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and other factors 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgement 
information regarding the company s other significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
property and equipment is recorded at cost 
expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements  maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life for owned assets and the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the underlying lease for leased assets 
changes in circumstances such as changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases where management determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  we would depreciate the net book value over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation and amortization expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or closing of facilities could also result in shortened useful lives 
our accounting policies regarding property and equipment include judgments by management regarding the estimated useful lives of these assets  the expected lease term for assets related to properties under lease and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact management s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  including restaurant sites  leasehold improvements  other fixed assets and amortized intangible assets are reviewed when indicators of impairment are present 
expected cash flows associated with an asset are the key factor in determining the recoverability of the asset 
identifiable cash flows are generally measured at the restaurant level 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
management s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
there were no asset impairment charges during the years ended december   december  or december  goodwill 
we also evaluate goodwill annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the carrying value of our net assets including goodwill balances to the fair value of our net assets using the quoted market price of our common stock 
we completed our most recent goodwill impairment test in december and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill 
in the event that business conditions change and our market value were to drop significantly below year end levels  future tests may result in a need to record a loss due to a write down of the value of goodwill 
at december   goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheet totaled million 
lease accounting 
under the provisions of certain of our leases  there are rent holidays and or escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of rent holidays and escalations are reflected in rent costs on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes cancelable option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we will exercise such option periods due to the fact that we would incur an economic penalty for not doing so 
the lease term commences on the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments which generally coincides with the time when the landlord delivers the property for us to develop and we waive contract contingencies 
all rent costs recognized during construction periods are expensed immediately as pre opening expenses 
judgments made by management for its lease obligations include the probable term for each lease which affects the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holidays and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent  and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
insurance self insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for a portion of losses related to group health insurance  general liability and workers compensation 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
the self insurance liability represents an estimate of the cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial based estimates  and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
in addition  our history of self insured experience is short and our significant rate of growth could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or should medical costs increase beyond what was expected  our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded 
actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated  resulting in expense reductions 
unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported under these programs 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued staff position fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  which requires rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period to be recognized as rental expense 
this staff position is effective for reporting periods beginning after december   and retrospective application is permitted but not required 
we have historically expensed rent costs incurred during the construction period 
accordingly  staff position fas is not expected to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb s emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 determining the amortization period for leasehold improvements purchased after lease inception or acquired in a business combination eitf no 

eitf no 
requires that leasehold improvements acquired in a business combination be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewals deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of acquisition 
eitf no 
further requires that leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of the lease term shall be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes the required lease periods and renewals deemed to be reasonably assured at the date of the acquisition 
eitf no 
became effective for the company s fiscal quarter beginning july  the adoption of eitf no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies the term conditional as used in sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity even if the timing and or settlement is conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of an entity 
accordingly  the entity must record a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r will require us to  among other things  measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
this statement becomes effective for annual periods beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
adoption of the expensing requirements will reduce our future reported earnings in a manner similar to that described in note to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption 
we adopted the provisions of sfas r in the first quarter of and expect the impact on fiscal to be approximately per diluted share 
in november  the fasb issued sfas  inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities  excess freight and handling costs  and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges 
the provisions of sfas become effective for annual periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposures for our assets are related to cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
under our revolving credit agreement  amended in december  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings  which bear interest at one of the following rates we select an alternate base rate abr  based on the prime rate plus to  or a libor  based on the relevant one  two  three or six month libor  at our discretion  plus to 
the spread  or margin  for abr and libor loans under the revolving credit agreement are subject to quarterly adjustment based on our then current leverage ratio  as defined by the agreement 
our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we may use interest rate swaps and caps to manage our net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings 
as appropriate  on the date derivative contracts are entered into  we designate derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
we are party to a variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement which expired on january  the agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge under which we paid interest on million of notional amount at a fixed rate and received interest on million of notional amount at a variable rate 
the variable rate interest received by us was initially based on the month libor rate determined two banking days prior to the effective date 
thereafter  the interest rate reset according to the then current month libor rate determined two banking days prior to the first day of each monthly calculation period 
this hedge is highly effective as defined by sfas  and there were no gains or losses recognized in earnings during or at the end of  the unrealized loss  net of taxes  on derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedging instruments that are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income was approximately  our variable rate based loans with ge capital bear interest at the day commercial paper rate plus a fixed percentage of to 
as of december   we had million of borrowings subject to variable interest rates  and a change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre tax interest expense fluctuating  on an annualized basis 
primarily all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in united states dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to foreign currency risk 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
