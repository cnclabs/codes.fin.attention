strategic overview canterbury park holding corporation the company was incorporated under the laws of minnesota and acquired the racetrack in march the racetrack facility is located in shakopee  minnesota  approximately miles southwest of downtown minneapolis 
in may we commenced year round horse racing simulcast operations and hosted the first annual live race meet during the summer of our live racing operations are a seasonal business as we host live race meets each year from early may until labor day 
we earn additional pari mutuel revenue by televising our live racing to out of state racetracks around the country 
we also derive revenues from related services and activities  such as advertising  admissions  parking and publication sales  and from other entertainment events and activities held at the racetrack 
in april we opened the canterbury card club the card club 
the card club operates hours a day  seven days a week and is limited by minnesota state law to a maximum of tables 
the card club currently offers tables of poker games and tables of casino games 
our three largest sources of revenues  card club operations  pari mutuel operations and concessions sales generate cash revenues 
consequently  the company is highly liquid and has not utilized its line of credit in over three years 
during the year ended december   increased competition discussed below along with a general industry decline in on track wagering and other causes mentioned in the operations review discussion that follows  resulted in a decrease in pari mutuel handle  pari mutuel revenues  and net income for the first time since the opening of the card club in financial performance summary total revenues operating expenses income before income tax expense income tax expense net income the primary strengths of canterbury park are our dedicated and capable staff  our first class facilities and acre property  and the legal authority to offer our unique gaming products in our market area 
our management team has extensive knowledge of the horse racing and card businesses and our staff has demonstrated a commitment to taking care of our customers 
recently we initiated a comprehensive customer satisfaction measurement and enhancement program 
our management team has good relationship with our workforce and is able to retain qualified personnel as demonstrated by our very low turnover rate 
our facilities are modern by racetrack industry standards and we have invested heavily in the past few years to update and upgrade them to meet the needs of our customers and horsemen 
our acre property with a prime location in one of the fastest growing areas in minnesota provides us with great long term growth and development opportunities 
our board of directors has begun the process of conducting research to determine the highest and best potential uses of our underutilized land 
our long term strategic direction is to enhance the character of our property as a unique gaming and entertainment destination 
we have a strong commitment to live racing and have been particularly successful in attracting new customers and providing a quality live racing experience for our horse racing fans as well as the horsemen who participate in the live racing at canterbury park 
the success of the card club has greatly enhanced our ability to offer a more competitive purse structure for our live racing and has allowed us to make significant improvements to our grandstand and the backside stabling and training facilities 
as a result  we have been near capacity for horses stabled at canterbury park during our recent live race meets 
we have also increased live racing attendance during a time when the industry trend has generally been downward 
currently we are the only facility offering live and simulcast racing in our market  although we do have competition in the simulcast market from internet horse racing sites 
while a number of minnesota tribal casinos operate the same unbanked card games offered at canterbury park  we are currently the only non tribal operator and we have the only poker room operating within the seven county twin cities metropolitan area 
however  in january  the mrc granted a second license to construct and operate a harness racetrack in columbus township  anoka county  mn 
while construction of the harness track has not begun as of march of  the licsensee has stated they plan to break ground this summer and hope to conduct a live harness meet in under current law this licensee would be allowed live and simulcast racing only on harness races and would have to operate a day live racing meet before they could be granted a license to operate a card club 
we continue to believe that our best option for long term growth is to gain authority under minnesota law to offer additional gaming options  which would enhance horse racing with increased purses  provide growth and development opportunities for us  and produce significant new tax revenues for state and local governments 
the effort to obtain legislative authority for these initiatives has required  and will continue to require  substantial expenditures 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcome of legislative activities  there can be no assurance that any bills favorable to the company s interests will be enacted into law  and it is possible bills adverse to the company could be enacted 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets at december  we utilize our judgment in various ways including determining whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset  determining the estimated useful lives of assets  and determining if or when an asset has been impaired 
management periodically reviews the carrying value of property and equipment for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of these assets with their related expected future net cash flows 
should the sum of the related expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value  we will determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized 
an impairment loss would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets 
to date  we have determined that no impairment of these assets exists 
regulation our business can be materially impacted both positively and negatively by legislative and regulatory changes  such as those previously described 
significant negative changes resulting from these activities could result in an impairment of our property and equipment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
additional information regarding how our business can be impacted by legislative and regulatory changes are included in item vi  and item vii  respectively  in this form k 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb revised sfas no

r 
this statement supercedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which resulted in no stock based employee compensation cost related to stock options if the options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
sfas no 
r requires recognition of employee services provided in exchange for a share based payment based on the grant date fair market value 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r as of january  and plan to adopt this statement using the modified prospective application method 
as of the effective date  this statement applies to all new awards issued as well as awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled 
additionally  for stock based awards issued prior to the effective date  compensation cost attributable to future services will be recognized as the remaining service is rendered 
contingencies in connection with the purchase of the racetrack  the company entered into an earn out promissory note dated march  in accordance with the earn out note if i off track betting becomes legally permissible in the state of minnesota and ii we begin to conduct off track betting with respect to or in connection with its operations  we will be required to pay to the imr fund  lp the greater of  per operating year  as defined  or of the net pretax profit  as defined for each of five operating years 
at this time  we believe that the likelihood that these two conditions will be met  and that we will be required to pay these amounts is remote 
at the date if any that these two conditions are met  the five minimum payments will be discounted back to their present value and the sum of those discounted payments will be capitalized as part of the purchase price in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the purchase price will be further increased if payments become due under the of net pretax profit calculation 
the first payment is to be made days after the end of the third operating year in which off track betting is conducted by us 
remaining payments would be made within days of the end of each of the next four operating years

pari mutuel revenues decreased million  or  to million compared to  primarily reflecting the decrease in all categories of handle for totaling million or  compared to total handle wagered on simulcast races in decreased million or compared to in addition  on track live handle decreased by  or compared to despite one additional live racing day in finally  out of state live handle decreased million  or  compared to the reduction in on track simulcast and live handle can be primarily attributed to an overall industry decline as well a number of other factors including significant growth in the accessibility of internet pari mutuel wagering  the lack of a triple crown contender in the belmont stakes  and major construction projects in on freeways leading to canterbury park 
there is also a shift in simulcast handle from days when only simulcasting is offered see table above to days when both live and simulcast racing are offered  due to the live meet starting one week earlier on kentucky derby day  may th  in compared to may th in the kentucky derby simulcast handle of million in is included in the table above in simulcast handle on live and simulcast days  compared to the kentucky derby simulcast handle of million which is included in simulcast handle on simulcast only days 
the decrease in amounts wagered by out of state racetracks on canterbury s live race meet is due primarily to our decision to discontinue accepting wagers from selected internet wagering and offshore locations due to questions about the regulation of these entities 
this decision contributed to lower wagering at out of state racetracks on the nationally recognized claiming crown racing event as handle decreased million to million in  from million in revenues recognized on proceeds from winning pari mutuel tickets  which were not presented for payment within one year of the end of the respective race meets  decreased to approximately  in compared to  in  reflecting a decrease in overall handle in summary of card club revenues year ended year ended poker games casino games total collection revenue other revenue total card club revenue number of days offered average revenue per day the primary source of card club revenue is a percentage of the wagers received from the players as compensation for providing the card club facility and services  referred to as collection revenue 
other revenue includes fees collected for the administration of tournaments  and amounts earned as reimbursement of the administrative costs of maintaining the jackpot funds 
the card club is divided into two areas  the casino games area and the poker area 
the average daily collection amount per game is dependent upon the number of tables utilized to offer the game 
patron demand determines the number of tables to be used for a specific game 
there were a total of tables in the casino games area and tables in the poker area at december   and and tables  respectively  in total card club revenue increased million or compared to the increase in card club revenue is due primarily to growth of million or in poker revenue  partially offset by reductions of  or in casino games and  or in other revenues 
the popularity of texas hold em and televised poker tournaments continues to fuel growth in our poker business 
however  our casino games operation experienced a significant increase in competition in from local native american casinos  which have expanded their casino games offerings to include the same unbanked card games offered at the card club 
card club revenues represent and of total revenues for and  respectively 
the percentage for is higher primarily due to decreased pari mutuel revenues accompanied by modest growth in card club revenues during we expect that competition from internet wagering and native american casinos will continue to put pressure on pari mutuel and card club operating revenues in future periods 
as a result  we continue to search for opportunities to make canterbury park the most attractive alternative when our customers want to wager on horseracing or play card games 
a number of promotions and initiatives to encourage on track simulcast wagering have recently been implemented and the card club is continually introducing new daily promotions 
concession revenues increased to  in compared to  in the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of  in food beverage revenues in the card club during compared to  an increase of  beverage sales during live racing  and an increase of  in revenues from group sales compared to primarily generated in a new outdoor catering area opened in other operating revenue increased  or to  in fiscal year compared to the increase in was due primarily to continued growth in the corporate sponsorship program of  and a rise in cash services fees of  resulting from increased patronage in the card club

the amount paid to the purse fund for wagers by out of state racetracks is of the net of fees collected less costs incurred to provide the uplink signal 
we experienced a decrease of  in purse expense attributable to lower on track wagering and wagering by out of state racetracks on live racing in  which was partially offset by an increase in the claiming crown net purse guarantee of  we pay of on track live handle to the mbf

growing card club revenues result in increased amounts of variable operating expenses  particularly purse and salaries and benefits expenses  but many of the card club s operating expenses are fixed and don t increase in proportion to business volume

we had no borrowings under the credit line during the years or our three largest sources of revenue  pari mutuel activities  card club operations  and concession sales  are generated primarily on a cash basis

we restrict cash balances which will be required to satisfy certain short term liabilities such as progressive jackpots  the player pool  and amounts due horsemen for purses and awards 
we believe that our existing cash balances  restricted cash balances  cash flow from operations and borrowings available under our credit line will be sufficient to support our working capital needs and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
casino games are played using a player pool 
player pool means a wagering system or game where wagers lost in a number of card games are accumulated into a pool for purposes of enhancing the total amount paid back to players in any other card game 
in such games  the sponsor may only serve as custodian of the player pool and may not have an active interest in any card game

the decrease in accounts payable and accrued wages and payroll taxes is due to a decrease of  in accrued wages and payroll taxes and a decrease of  in accounts payable and accruals
