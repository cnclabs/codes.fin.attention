this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this annual report 
we manufacture  recycle  market and distribute steel and metal products through a network of over locations in the united states and internationally 
our segment reporting includes five reportable segments domestic mills  cmc zawiercie cmcz  domestic fabrication  recycling and marketing and distribution 
the domestic mills segment includes the company s domestic steel minimills including the scrap processing facilities which directly support these mills and the copper tube minimill 
the copper tube minimill is aggregated with the company s steel minimills because it has similar economic characteristics 
the cmcz minimill and related operations in poland have been presented as a separate segment because the economic characteristics of their markets and the regulatory environment in which they operate are different from the company s domestic minimills 
the domestic fabrication segment consists of the company s rebar and joist fabrication operations  fence post manufacturing plants  construction related and other products facilities 
the recycling segment consists of the cmc recycling division s scrap processing and sales operations primarily in texas  florida and the southern united states 
marketing and distribution includes both domestic and international operations for the sales  distribution and processing of both ferrous and nonferrous metals and other industrial products 
the segment s activities consist only of physical transactions and not speculation 
domestic mills operations we conduct our domestic mills operations through a network of steel mills  commonly referred to as minimills  that produce reinforcing bar  angles  flats  rounds  fence post sections and other shapes  scrap processing facilities that directly support these minimills  and a copper tube minimill 

table of contents cmcz operations we conduct our cmcz operations through a rolling mill that produces primarily reinforcing bar and some merchant products  a rolling mill that produces primarily wire rod  our scrap processing facilities that directly support the cmcz minimill  and steel fabrication plant primarily for reinforcing bar 
domestic fabrication operations we conduct our domestic fabrication operations through a network of steel fabrication and processing plants that bend  weld  cut  fabricate  distribute and place steel  primarily reinforcing bar and angles  warehouses that sell or rent products for the installation of concrete  plants that produce special sections for floors and ceiling support  plants that produce steel fence posts  plants that treat steel with heat to strengthen and provide flexibility  and a railroad rail salvage company 
recycling operations we conduct our recycling operations through metal processing plants located in the states of texas  oklahoma  kansas  louisiana  arkansas  missouri  georgia  tennessee  florida  south carolina  and north carolina 
marketing and distribution operations we market and distribute steel  copper and aluminum coil  sheet and tubing  ores  metal concentrates  industrial minerals  ferroalloys and chemicals through our network of marketing and distribution offices  processing facilities and joint ventures around the world 
our customers use these products in a variety of industries 
you should read this management s discussion and analysis in connection with your review of our consolidated audited financial statements and the accompanying footnotes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following are important accounting policies  estimates and assumptions that you should understand as you review our financial statements 
we apply these accounting policies and make these estimates and assumptions to prepare financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our use of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions affects our results of operations and our reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
where we have used estimates or assumptions  actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize sales when title passes to the customer either when goods are shipped or when they are received based on the terms of the sale 
when we estimate that a contract with one of our customers will result in a loss  we accrue the entire loss as soon as it is probable and estimable 

table of contents contingencies we make accruals as needed for litigation  administrative proceedings  government investigations including environmental matters  and contract disputes 
we base our environmental liabilities on estimates regarding the number of sites for which we will be responsible  the scope and cost of work to be performed at each site  the portion of costs that we expect we will share with other parties and the timing of the remediation 
where timing of expenditures can be reliably estimated  we discount amounts to reflect our cost of capital over time 
we record these and other contingent liabilities when they are probable and when we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss 
where timing and amounts cannot be precisely estimated  we estimate a range  and we recognize the low end of the range without discounting 
also  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
inventory cost we determine inventory cost for most domestic inventories by the last in  first out method  or lifo 
beginning fiscal  we refined our method of estimating our interim lifo reserve by using quantities and costs at quarter end and recording the resulting lifo expense in its entirety 
at the end of each quarter in  we estimated both inventory quantities and costs that we expected at the end of the fiscal year for the lifo calculations  and we recorded an amount on a pro rata basis 
these estimates could vary substantially from the actual year end results  causing an adjustment to cost of goods sold in our fourth quarter 
see note  quarterly financial data  to the consolidated financial statements 
we record all inventories at the lower of their cost or market value 
property  plant and equipment our domestic mills  cmcz  domestic fabrication and recycling businesses are capital intensive 
we evaluate the value of these assets and other long lived assets whenever a change in circumstances indicates that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
some of the estimated values for assets that we currently use in our operations utilize judgments and assumptions of future undiscounted cash flows that the assets will produce 
if these assets were for sale  our estimates of their values could be significantly different because of market conditions  specific transaction terms and a buyer s different viewpoint of future cash flows 
also  we depreciate property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on our estimate of the assets economically useful lives and are evaluated annually 
to the extent that an asset s actual life differs from our estimate  there could be an impact on depreciation expense or a gain loss on the disposal of the asset in a later period 
we expense major maintenance costs as incurred 
other accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements see note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated results of operations year ended august  in millions except share data net sales net earnings per diluted share ebitda international net sales as of total sales lifo effect on net earnings expense per diluted share last in  first out inventory valuation method 
in the table above  we have included a financial statement measure that was not derived in accordance with gaap 
we use ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization as a non gaap performance measure 
in calculating ebitda  we exclude our largest recurring non cash charge  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal  state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions 
tax regulations in international operations add additional complexity 
also  we exclude interest cost in our calculation of ebitda 
the results are  therefore  without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed 
we use ebitda as one guideline to assess our unleveraged performance return on our investments 
ebitda is also the target benchmark for our long term cash incentive performance plan for management 
reconciliations to net earnings are provided below for the year ended august 
table of contents in millions net earnings interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda ebitda does not include interest expense  income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
because we have borrowed money in order to partially finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate revenues 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
also  the payment of income taxes is a necessary element of our operations 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is appropriate to consider both net earnings determined under gaap  as well as ebitda  to evaluate our performance 
also  we separately analyze any significant fluctuations in interest expense  depreciation and amortization and income taxes 
the following events had a significant financial impact during our fiscal year ended august  as compared to our fiscal year we reported our highest net sales and net earnings ever for the third straight year 
increased selling prices  margins and volumes resulted in significantly higher adjusted operating profits in our domestic mills  cmcz and recycling segments 
increased sales prices at our copper tube mill offset the dramatic jump in the cost of copper scrap  giving significantly greater metal spreads and record adjusted operating profits 
sales price gains at cmcz exceeded the increase in the cost of scrap and together with volume increases allowed the operation to go from break even in to million adjusted operating profit in domestic fabrication had a increase in volume  but the cost of steel was up considerably resulting in some margin squeeze and a slight decrease in adjusted operating profit 
we had successful start ups of the new continuous caster at the texas mill and the new scrap mega shredder at the cmcz mill 
a volume increase  strong ferrous prices and historically high nonferrous prices helped our recycling segment to achieve a record adjusted operating profit 
we recorded a million after tax lifo expense per diluted share compared to million lifo expense per diluted share in our overall effective tax rate decreased to as compared to in due to shifts in profitability among tax jurisdictions  the manufacturing deduction and tax repatriation benefit 
in  our net earnings reached all time record levels as a result of the combination of higher selling prices  margins and volume in most of our segments 
non ferrous selling prices and margins reached historically high levels 
these positive factors more than offset increased purchase prices and other input costs 
we continued to benefit from favorable market conditions for most of our businesses and achieved excellent performance in all of our segments 
strong global expansion has helped  and the improved economic situation in central and western europe has helped our polish operations achieve much improved net earnings 
our net earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal exceeded those for any previous fiscal quarter that we have ever reported 

table of contents segments unless otherwise indicated  all dollars below are before minority interests and income taxes 
financial results for our reportable segments are consistent with the basis and manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information for making operating decisions 
see note  business segments  to the consolidated financial statements 
we use adjusted operating profit loss to compare and evaluate the financial performance of our segments 
adjusted operating profit is the sum of our earnings before income taxes  minority interests and financing costs 
adjusted operating profit is equal to earnings before income taxes for our domestic mills and domestic fabrication segments because these segments require minimal outside financing 
the following table shows net sales and adjusted operating profit loss by business segment year ended august  in millions net sales domestic mills cmcz domestic fabrication recycling marketing and distribution corporate and eliminations adjusted operating profit loss domestic mills cmcz domestic fabrication recycling marketing and distribution corporate and eliminations dollars are before minority interests 
lifo impact on adjusted operating profit lifo is an inventory costing method that assumes the most recent inventory purchases or goods manufactured are sold first 
this results in current sales prices offset against current inventory costs 
in periods of rising prices it has the effect of eliminating inflationary profits from net income 
in periods of declining prices it has the effect of eliminating deflationary losses from net income 
in either case the goal is to reflect economic profit 
the table below reflects lifo income or expense representing decreases or increases in the lifo inventory reserve 
cmcz is not included in this table as it uses fifo valuation exclusively for its inventory three months ended twelve months ended august  august  domestic mills domestic fabrication recycling marketing and distribution consolidated increase decrease to adjusted profit before tax compared to domestic mills we include our four domestic steel minimills and our copper tube minimill in our domestic mills segment 
in  our domestic mills segment set another all time annual record for adjusted operating profits 
higher selling prices  metal margins and volumes at our domestic steel mills in as compared to helped net sales and adjusted operating profit continue to grow 
metal margins the difference between the average selling price and cost of scrap consumed for the segment increased in as compared to because increases in selling prices at our domestic steel mills more than offset the increases in scrap purchase and other input costs 
in addition  historically high sales prices and metal margins helped our copper tube minimill achieve record adjusted operating profit 
the high prices of steel and copper scrap caused lifo expense for to be at a very high million as compared to million in 
table of contents within the segment adjusted operating profit for our four domestic steel minimills was million for the year ended august  as compared to million for this million increase in adjusted operating profit is even more remarkable considering contained million of insurance recoveries 
selling prices and metal margins increased in as compared to due to continued strong global demand for steel 
volumes shipped were also up at all four mills compared to average scrap purchase costs were higher than last year as the world demand for ferrous scrap also remained strong 
our overall metal margins increased  resulting in higher total adjusted operating profits for the four steel minimills in as compared to the table below reflects domestic steel and ferrous scrap prices per ton for the year ended august increase average mill selling price finished goods average mill selling price total sales average cost of ferrous scrap consumed average fifo metal margin average ferrous scrap purchase price the table below reflects our domestic steel minimills operating statistics for the year ended august increase short tons in thousands amount tons melted tons rolled tons shipped overall  our domestic steel minimills recorded million lifo expense in as compared to million in our utility expenses increased by million in as compared to electricity increased by million and natural gas costs increased by million due primarily to higher rates 
year over year costs for ferroalloys  graphite electrodes and other supplies increased  while transportation rates rose significantly 
we had a successful startup of the new continuous caster at the texas mill during the fourth quarter of our copper tube minimill s adjusted operating profit was a record million for the year ended august  as compared to million for the record adjusted operating profit was achieved on volume slightly less than  but much higher selling prices and metal margins 
the decline in housing starts coupled with the extraordinary high price of copper reduced the demand for copper plumbing tube across the us our sales of plumbing tube were lower  but sales of high value added products increased disproportionately 
we matched production and inventory levels to coincide with order intake levels 
we were able to increase the average selling price for the year to per pound  an historical high  and metal spreads widened significantly to per pound  up from per pound  more than offsetting the dramatic jump in the cost of copper scrap 
the table below reflects our copper tube minimill s prices per pound and operating statistics for the year ended august increase decrease pounds in millions amount pounds shipped pounds produced average selling price average scrap purchase cost average fifo metal margin our copper tube minimill recorded million lifo expense for the year ended august  as compared to million in

prices and margins were improved for the year with metal margins increasing over as the cost of ferrous scrap decreased slightly 
operating levels and shipments were also up compared to  including a increase in shipments 
functional currency fluctuations did not have a significant impact on adjusted operating profits 
the startup and operation of the new mega shredder during the fourth quarter of was successful  and the greenfield rebar fabrication plant in zawiercie had a successful start in july domestic fabrication tons shipped in were up and sales were up compared to  however  adjusted operating profit was down because the cost of steel was up considerably resulting in some margin squeeze and lifo expense increased over lifo expense increased dramatically because of the higher steel price and more inventories on hand 
during fiscal  we acquired the operating assets of concrete formtek services  inc  cherokee supply  brost forming supply and hall hodges company 
these acquisitions did not significantly impact our adjusted operating profit 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below shows our average fabrication selling prices per short ton excluding stock and buyout sales and total fabrication plant shipments for the years ended august increase decrease average selling price amount rebar joist structural post excluding stock and buyout sales increase tons shipped in thousands amount rebar joist structural post recycling gross margins in were higher as compared to the average selling price of ferrous scrap remained strong with a increase over the average selling price of nonferrous for increased over prices 
volume was also up in fiscal with a increase in ferrous tons shipped and a increase in nonferrous tons shipped 
lifo expense for fiscal had a significant increase of million over caused primarily by the higher prices 
during july  cmc acquired the operating assets of yonack iron metal co  which operates scrap metal processing facilities in texas  oklahoma and arkansas 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table reflects our recycling segment s average selling prices per short ton and tons shipped in thousands for the year ended august 
table of contents increase amount average ferrous selling price average nonferrous selling price ferrous tons shipped nonferrous tons shipped total volume processed and shipped includes all of our domestic processing plants 
marketing and distribution the primary reason for the decrease in adjusted operating profit was a significant million lifo expense increase in fiscal as compared to the increase in lifo expense was caused mainly by higher prices for aluminum  copper and stainless steel inventories and increased prices and inventory levels of long and flat rolled steel product 
market conditions varied by product and geography  but overall were favorable 
steel tonnage was up in most of our markets  especially sales into the us  although sales dollars were mixed in various markets 
aluminum  copper and stainless semis were characterized by higher prices but lower volumes  which on balance resulted in higher gross margins  but higher transaction costs as well 
sales and margins for industrial materials and products  though solid  were off the peaks of last year reflecting mostly weaker market conditions and volatile prices 
our value added downstream and processing businesses continued to perform well 
during  we received a dividend of czk million million from trinecke zelezarny  a czech steel mill in which we own of the outstanding shares as compared to a dividend of czk million million received in corporate and eliminations we recognized income of million on investment assets in our segregated trust for our benefit restoration plan during the year ended august   as compared to million for see note  employees retirement plans  to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  professional services expense increased million over  primarily for information technology 
consolidated data on a consolidated basis  the lifo method of inventory valuation decreased our net earnings by million and million cents and cents per diluted share for the years ended august  and  respectively 
our overall selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million for the year ended august  as compared to most of this increase was due to higher discretionary incentive compensation and profit sharing accruals during the year ended august  as compared to due to increased earnings 
foreign currency fluctuations resulted in decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended august  as compared to our interest expense decreased by million during as compared to as our average borrowings decreased though short term interest rates increased more than on an annualized basis in our effective tax rate for the year ended august  decreased to as compared to in due to shifts in profitability among tax jurisdictions  the manufacturing deduction and tax repatriation benefit 
near term outlook the prospects are excellent for another strong year for cmc 
it should exhibit the traditional seasonal pattern of a good start  seasonal slowdown  and strong pickup in our third and fourth quarter 
if cmcz can weather the winter in good order  the year may well approach fiscal though lifo s impact is always difficult to quantify 
we see solid demand during the first quarter in most of our global markets and inventories of most products appear in line with sales 
although some economists point to a slowing global economy  the overall level of activity remains robust and broad based 
worldwide manufacturing activity continues to expand 
while residential construction in the us has weakened  non residential construction remains strong in the us  asia and south america  and has picked up in europe 
more pointedly  construction materials generally are in strong demand 
our domestic steel mill markets remain vibrant and central europe has strengthened 
while imports of carbon steel bar products in recent months have increased sharply into the us  strong demand appears to be absorbing the supply 
our mill shipments in the us and poland will remain strong during the first quarter of fiscal  and realized steel prices should remain high 
there is good news on the energy cost side  especially the fall in natural gas prices 
ferrous scrap prices will remain at high levels  although likely to be down for the quarter 
nonferrous markets continue at historically high levels 
demand for downstream products and services remains vibrant  and the current short term margin compression should abate 

table of contents net income from our domestic steel mills should remain strong during the first quarter  above the first quarter of last year although down from the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  we have scheduled shutdowns at each of our domestic steel mills during the first two quarters for routine maintenance or budgeted capital projects 
earnings from the copper tube business will be lower than the fourth quarter of fiscal results at cmcz are expected to remain excellent 
our anticipation is that fabrication profits will improve as finished goods steel prices remain relatively flat 
our recycling segment will again post strong results  both from ferrous and nonferrous areas  although down from the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect the marketing and distribution segment to have another satisfactory quarter driven by relatively firm volume and margins in various steel markets  improved results in nonferrous semis  and steady performance for industrial materials 
accordingly  we estimate that our first quarter lifo diluted earnings per share will be between and 
we anticipate that our capital spending for will be million  including the start of implementing a new wire rod block line at cmcz and new mill stands and reheat furnace at our alabama mill 
we believe that we will derive benefits from reduced operating costs and increased productivity in from the new large capacity shredder at cmcz and the continuous caster project at our cmc texas mill which became operational in the fourth quarter of  and from other capital projects to be completed in fiscal long term outlook the rapid expansion of a number of emerging economies  including china and india  has been a major catalyst for the strong steel and nonferrous markets around the world 
the magnitude of the growth in these economies has been a new dynamic in the global marketplace 
therefore  we believe that there is an enhanced prospect of significant long term growth in demand for the global materials sector 
we believe that we are well positioned to exploit long term opportunities 
we expect strong demand for our products due to demand throughout the major global economies as well as continued growth in developing countries 
emerging countries often have a higher growth rate for steel and nonferrous metals consumption 
we believe that the demand will increase in asia  particularly in china and india  as well as in central and eastern europe 
we believe that there will be further consolidation in our industries  and we plan to continue to participate in a prudent way 
the reasons for further consolidation include a historically inadequate return on capital for many companies  a high degree of fragmentation  the need to eliminate non competitive capacity and more effective marketing 
we also believe our aggressive capital expenditure plan will allow us to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness and help us meet our customers demand for our products currently and in future years 
we are undertaking a year enterprise resource planning system implementation program to improve our operating systems 
compared to domestic mills net sales and adjusted operating profit were higher in due primarily to higher selling prices and metal margins at our domestic steel mills as compared to metal margins for the segment increased significantly in as compared to because increases in selling prices at our domestic steel mills more than offset the increases in scrap purchase and other input costs 
although our copper tube minimill increased its selling prices during as compared to  purchase prices of copper scrap increased even more 
as a result  our metal margin declined for this mill 
also  expenses related to valuing our inventories under the lifo method decreased as compared to primarily because scrap purchase and other input costs did not increase as rapidly in as compared to during the year ended august   we recorded million recoveries for the settlement of insurance claims relating to prior year transformer failures at our steel minimills 
adjusted operating profit for our four domestic steel minimills was million for the year ended august  as compared to million for selling prices and metal margins increased in as compared to due to strong global demand for steel 
also  the competition from foreign steel imports was less as a result of the weaker us dollar and stronger global markets 
average scrap purchase costs were higher than last year due primarily to increased world demand for ferrous scrap 
our overall metal margins increased  resulting in significantly higher total adjusted operating profits for the four steel minimills in as compared to the table below reflects domestic steel and ferrous scrap prices per ton for the year ended august increase average mill selling price finished goods average mill selling price total sales average cost of ferrous scrap consumed average fifo metal margin average ferrous scrap purchase price 
table of contents the domestic steel minimills production and shipment levels tons melted  rolled and shipped for the year ended august  decreased slightly as compared to the at all time record levels set in as our customers worked through excess inventories 
during  we scheduled our maintenance and lowered our production in order to most effectively manage our inventory levels 
the table below reflects our domestic steel minimills operating statistics for the year ended august decrease short tons in thousands amount tons melted tons rolled tons shipped overall  our domestic steel minimills recorded million lifo expense in as compared to million in our utility expenses increased by thousand in as compared to electricity decreased by thousand due to both lower usage from decreased overall production and rate decreases due to refunds 
natural gas costs increased by million due to higher rates which more than offset lower usage 
costs for ferroalloys increased by million in as compared to largely due to more demand from us mills  the impact of the weaker us dollar and higher ocean freight costs on these imported items 
also  in  all of our domestic steel minimills focused on controlling costs and improving productivity  quality and safety 
the texas highway building program provided good business opportunities for cmc texas 
a new scrap yard was established at cmc alabama to improve scrap flow and reduce congestion inside the mill and reduce scrap handling costs 
the installation of a new electric arc furnace transformer and expansion of the baghouse at cmc south carolina increased our steel melting capacity 
during the year ended august   cmc texas and cmc south carolina recorded million and million  respectively  from insurance recoveries see note commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
our copper tube minimill s adjusted operating profit was million during the year ended august  as compared to an adjusted operating profit of million for although our average selling price for copper tube increased  our average copper scrap purchase cost increased more than our average selling price resulting in decreased metal margins in as compared to copper scrap purchase prices increased because global demand for copper scrap exceeded supply 
however  we could not increase our selling prices for copper tube because of pressure from alternative competing products such as plastic water tubing and consolidation among our customers 
the table below reflects our copper tube minimill s prices per pound and operating statistics for the year ended august increase decrease pounds in millions amount pounds shipped pounds produced average selling price average scrap purchase cost average fifo metal margin our copper tube minimill recorded thousand lifo expense for the year ended august  as compared to million in

also  our ability to export cmcz s products from poland to other key international markets was limited in due to the strong polish zloty  especially relative to the euro 
however  we reported an adjusted operating profit from cmcz of million during our fourth quarter as market conditions improved 
functional currency fluctuations did not have a significant impact on adjusted operating profits 
domestic fabrication during the year ended august   we acquired the operating assets of jl davidson company s rebar fabricating facility in california and a joist manufacturing plant in juarez  mexico 
these acquisitions did not significantly impact our adjusted operating profit 
on december   we acquired of the stock of lofland acquisition  inc lofland which operates steel reinforcing bar fabrication and construction related product sales facilities in texas  arkansas  louisiana  oklahoma  new mexico and mississippi 
during the first four months of  this acquisition accounted for million and million in net sales and adjusted operating profit  respectively  and also accounted for thousand tons shipped during the same period 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
our domestic fabrication segment s overall adjusted operating profit increased in as compared to due to our overall higher average selling prices and higher shipments which more than offset increases in our steel purchase costs 
market conditions were favorable  resulting in higher gross margins in all of our product lines including rebar fabrication  construction related products  steel fence posts  steel joists  castellated beams and structural steel fabrication 
the table below shows our average fabrication selling prices per short ton excluding stock and buyout sales and total fabrication plant shipments for the years ended august increase average selling price amount rebar joist structural post excluding stock and buyout sales increase tons shipped amount rebar joist structural post 
table of contents we recorded million of lifo expense in our domestic fabrication segment for the year ended august   due to the higher cost of steel and more inventories on hand 
during the year ended august   we recorded million of lifo expense 
during the year ended august   we recorded impairment charges of million 
see note  asset impairment charges  to the consolidated financial statements 
recycling gross margins in were higher as compared to our ferrous and nonferrous scrap selling prices increased because demand from far eastern buyers  especially china  and the weaker us dollar resulted in more scrap exports by our competitors  especially early in fiscal the ferrous scrap market was extremely volatile during  and scrap prices generally decreased after our first quarter 
our ferrous sales volumes decreased slightly during as compared to due to production cutbacks and cautious buying by our steel mill customers 
however  by the end of the fourth quarter  global demand for ferrous scrap increased which resulted in increased prices 
during  our nonferrous scrap shipments increased as compared to due to higher demand for aluminum  copper and stainless steel scrap  although demand for stainless weakened in our fourth quarter 
the following table reflects our recycling segment s average selling prices per short ton and tons shipped in thousands for the year ended august increase decrease amount average ferrous selling price average nonferrous selling price ferrous tons shipped nonferrous tons shipped total volume processed and shipped includes all of our domestic processing plants 
also  we recorded million lifo expense for the year ended august  as compared to million in  due primarily to increased average material purchase costs for the fiscal year 
marketing and distribution net sales in our marketing and distribution segment increased by billion for the year ended august  to billion as compared to  million of which resulted from functional currency fluctuations 
our adjusted operating profit for the year ended august  was million as compared to million in  an increase of 
our increased profitability in marketing and distribution was largely the result of our strategy in recent years to build up our regional business around the world and to increase our downstream presence 
the net effect of functional currency fluctuations on our adjusted operating profit was immaterial 
the majority of the increases in net sales and adjusted operating profit were due to higher shipments and selling prices in as compared to the effect of these increases was partially offset by million lifo expense in lifo expense of million was recorded in markets were favorable in most geographic regions around the world 
we imported more steel  aluminum  copper and stainless steel semi finished products into the united states  and gross margins for these products were higher in as compared to our net sales to and within europe  asia including china and australia increased significantly in as compared to due mainly to significant selling price increases which more than offset increases in purchases costs for our products and higher freight costs 
our sales and adjusted operating profits for industrial materials and products including minerals  ores  refractories  ferroalloys and various metals and alloys were at record levels because of strong global demand from the metals industry and short supply 
also  we added several new products 
however  during our fourth quarter  prices decreased for some industrial materials and products  returning to more historical levels 
during  we received a dividend of czk million million from our investee  trinecke zelezarny  a czech steel mill  as compared to a dividend of czk million million received in corporate and eliminations we recognized income of million on investment assets in our segregated trust for our benefit restoration plan during the year ended august  see note  employees retirement plans  to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended august   we incurred a million charge from the repurchase of million of our notes payable otherwise due in consolidated data on a consolidated basis  the lifo method of inventory valuation decreased our net earnings by million and million and per diluted share for the years ended august  and  respectively 
our overall selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million for the year ended august  as compared to most of this increase was due to higher discretionary incentive compensation and profit sharing accruals during the year ended august  as compared to due to increased earnings 
our acquisitions of cmcz and lofland accounted for 
table of contents million of the increase for the year ended august  our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended august  included asset impairment charges of million and losses on reacquisition of debt of million 
foreign currency fluctuations resulted in increases in selling  general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended august  as compared to our interest expense increased by million during as compared to due primarily to increased discount costs on extended term documentary letters of credit 
in addition  short term interest rates increased more than on an annualized basis during the year ended august  as compared to our effective tax rate for the year ended august  increased to as compared to in due to a shift in profitability from low tax jurisdictions poland to those domestic jurisdictions subject to state taxes

our domestic securitization program contains certain cross default provisions whereby a termination event could occur should we default under another credit arrangement  and contains covenants that conform to the same requirements contained in our revolving credit agreement 
cash flows our cash flows from operating activities primarily result from sales of steel and related products  and to a lesser extent  sales of nonferrous metal products 
we also sell and rent construction related products and accessories 
we have a diverse and generally stable customer base 
we use futures or forward contracts as needed to mitigate the risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and metals commodity prices 
see note  financial instruments  market and credit risk  to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents during the year ended august   we generated million of net cash flows from our operating activities as compared to the million of net cash flows provided by our operating activities for the year ended august  significant fluctuations in working capital were as follows increased accounts receivable higher selling prices and increased volume 
increased inventories higher carrying costs  increased volume and more in transit inventory  offset by a much higher lifo reserve

our contractual obligations for the next twelve months of billion are typically expenditures to be paid in the ordinary course of revenue generatiang activities 
we believe our cash flows from operating activities and debt facilities are adequate to fund our ongoing operations and planned capital expenditures 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of august  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt notes payable interest operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we have not discounted the cash obligations in this table 
total amounts are included in the august  consolidated balance sheet 
see note  credit arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements 
interest payments related to our short term debt are not included in the table as they do not represent a significant obligation as of august  includes minimum lease payment obligations for non cancelable equipment and real estate leases in effect as of august  see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
approximately of these purchase obligations are for inventory items to be sold in the ordinary course of business 
purchase obligations include all enforceable  legally binding agreements to purchase goods or services that specify all significant terms  
table of contents regardless of the duration of the agreement 
agreements with variable terms are excluded because we are unable to estimate the minimum amounts 
other commercial commitments we maintain stand by letters of credit to provide support for certain transactions that our customers or suppliers request 
at august   we had committed million under these arrangements 
all commitments expire within one year 
in january  we entered into a guarantee agreement to assist one of our chinese coke suppliers to obtain pre production financing from a bank 
in may  we entered into another guarantee agreement for one of our suppliers financing 
our maximum exposure under the guarantees at august  was million 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business  we become involved in litigation  administrative proceedings and government investigations  including environmental matters 
we may incur settlements  fines  penalties or judgments because of some of these matters 
while we are unable to estimate precisely the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
the amounts we accrue could vary substantially from amounts we pay due to several factors including the following evolving remediation technology  changing regulations  possible third party contributions  the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process  and the uncertainties involved in litigation 
accordingly  we cannot always estimate a meaningful range of possible exposure 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the estimable probable impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations or our financial position 
however  they may have a material impact on earnings for a particular quarter 
environmental and other matters see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
general we are subject to federal  state and local pollution control laws and regulations 
we anticipate that compliance with these laws and regulations will involve continuing capital expenditures and operating costs 
our original business and one of our core businesses for over nine decades is metals recycling 
in the present era of conservation of natural resources and ecological concerns  we are committed to sound ecological and business conduct 
certain governmental regulations regarding environmental concerns  however well intentioned  are contrary to the goal of greater recycling 
such regulations expose us and the industry to potentially significant risks 
we believe that recycled materials are commodities that are diverted by recyclers  such as us  from the solid waste streams because of their inherent value 
commodities are materials that are purchased and sold in public and private markets and commodities exchanges every day around the world 
they are identified  purchased  sorted  processed and sold in accordance with carefully established industry specifications 
environmental agencies at various federal and state levels classify certain recycled materials as hazardous substances and subject recyclers to material remediation costs  fines and penalties 
taken to extremes  such actions could cripple the recycling industry and undermine any national goal of material conservation 
enforcement  interpretation  and litigation involving these regulations are not well developed 
solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease  and in the past owned or leased  properties that have been used in our operations 
although we used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties or on or under locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal 
we are currently involved in the investigation and remediation of several such properties 
state and federal laws applicable to wastes and contaminated properties have gradually become stricter over time 
under new laws  we could be required to remediate properties impacted by previously disposed wastes 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp at a number of contaminated sites 

table of contents we generate wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state and or local statutes where we operate 
these statutes  regulations and laws may have limited disposal options for certain wastes 
superfund the us environmental protection agency epa or an equivalent state agency notified us that we are considered a prp at thirteen sites  none owned by us 
we may be obligated under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla or a similar state statute to conduct remedial investigation  feasibility studies  remediation and or removal of alleged releases of hazardous substances or to reimburse the epa for such activities 
we are involved in litigation or administrative proceedings with regard to several of these sites in which we are contesting  or at the appropriate time we may contest  our liability at the sites 
in addition  we have received information requests with regard to other sites which may be under consideration by the epa as potential cercla sites 
because of various factors  including the ambiguity of the regulations  the difficulty of identifying the responsible parties for any particular site  the complexity of determining the relative liability among them  the uncertainty as to the most desirable remediation techniques and the amount of damages and cleanup costs and the extended time periods over which such costs may be incurred  we cannot reasonably estimate our ultimate costs of compliance with cercla 
at august   based on currently available information  which is in many cases preliminary and incomplete  we believe that our aggregate liability for cleanup and remediation costs in connection with nine of the thirteen sites will be between million and million 
we have accrued for these liabilities based upon our best estimates 
we are not able to estimate the possible range of loss on the other sites 
the amounts paid and the expenses incurred on these thirteen sites for the year ended august   and were not material 
historically  the amounts that we have ultimately paid for such remediation activities have not been material 
clean water act the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined 
these controls have become more stringent over time and it is probable that additional restrictions will be imposed in the future 
permits must generally be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters  comparable permits may be required at the state level 
the cwa and many state agencies provide for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of pollutants 
in addition  the epa has promulgated regulations that may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
clean air act our operations are subject to regulations at the federal  state and local level for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution 
new and modified sources of air pollutants are often required to obtain permits prior to commencing construction  modification and or operations 
major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent requirements  including the potential need for additional permits and to increased scrutiny in the context of enforcement 
the epa has been implementing its stationary emission control program through expanded enforcement of the new source review program 
under this program  new or modified sources are required to construct what is referred to as the best available control technology 
additionally  the epa is implementing new  more stringent standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
the epa recently has promulgated new national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for steel mills which will require all major sources in this category to meet the standards by reflecting application of maximum achievable control technology 
compliance with the new standards could require additional expenditures 
in fiscal  we incurred environmental expenses of million 
the expenses included the cost of environmental personnel at various divisions  permit and license fees  accruals and payments for studies  tests  assessments  remediation  consultant fees  baghouse dust removal and various other expenses 
approximately million of our capital expenditures for related to costs directly associated with environmental compliance 
at august   million was accrued for environmental liabilities of which million was classified as other long term liabilities 
business interruption insurance claims and unclaimed property see note  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
dividends we have paid quarterly cash dividends in each of the past consecutive quarters 
we paid dividends in our fiscal year at the rate of cents per share in the first two quarters  cents for the third quarter and cents for the fourth quarter

the following types of derivative instruments were outstanding at august   in accordance with our risk management program 
currency exchange forwards we enter into currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of international trade commitments denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  or  if the transaction involves our australian or european subsidiaries  their local currency 
no single foreign currency poses a primary risk to us 
fluctuations that cause temporary disruptions in one market segment tend to open opportunities in other segments 
commodity prices we base pricing in some of our sales and purchase contracts on forward metal commodity exchange quotes which we determine at the beginning of the contract 
due to the volatility of the metal commodity indexes  we enter into metal commodity forward or futures contracts for copper  aluminum  nickel and zinc 
these forwards or futures mitigate the risk of unanticipated declines in gross margins on these contractual commitments 
physical transaction quantities will not match exactly with standard commodity lot sizes  leading to small gains and losses from ineffectiveness 
interest rates if interest rates increased or decreased by one percentage point  the effect on interest expense related to our variable rate debt and the fair value of our long term debt would be approximately thousand and million  respectively
