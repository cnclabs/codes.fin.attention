item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview with respect to the us economy  spending continues to improve in many of the areas of information technology it that we target 
these areas include enterprise and other critical application development  enterprise storage and enterprise integration projects  compliance resulting from sarbanes oxley regulations  and standardization of application systems 
enterprises are also consolidating their it environments to lower their costs 
sales cycles of our products and services are still relatively long  with customers frequently requiring a product pilot before a larger purchase will occur 
in our emea segment  the european economy is flat  and market spending is still below expectations with long sales cycles and a clear focus on it cost savings 
consolidation of platforms and security remain high priority items for our customers  and initiatives on auditing in the health and public sector are increasing on a small enterprise and local government scale 
our emea segment remains a focus for our management and we expect to face continued financial challenges here 
the economy in asia pacific  including japan  is mixed as some regions continue to struggle with core economic issues and others are growing at or above global rates 
as a result  our strategic focus is to provide enterprise class infrastructure software and services with a flexible combination of open source and proprietary technologies 
by implementing our solutions  customers can reduce costs and complexity while increasing the return on their it investment 
unlike other providers  we help customers migrate from proprietary solutions to open source technology at a pace that best suits them 
in support of this strategy  we have identified several key initiatives 
these initiatives include increasing revenue from our linux and open source product offerings  increasing revenue from our identity and resource management product offerings  reducing reliance on our traditional product offerings  such as netware  and  expanding our global reach with a strong  directed go to market plan 
our initiatives and their implementation involve opportunities  risks and challenges 
the following discusses our progress regarding these initiatives and their implementation during fiscal  as well as the risks and challenges we believe we face over the next year 
one of our most important strategies is to embrace the open source movement and to develop a competitive position in the linux market 
as part of the effort to build our competitive position  we offer a full range of enterprise solutions on the linux platform  from the desktop  to the server  to the mainframe 
our strategy is to help grow the market for linux products and services beyond the growth rate for traditional  proprietary solutions 
with an increasing market for such open source products and services  we believe that we will have the opportunity to improve our market share position as well as sell additional products and services to our installed base 
linux enterprise customer successes throughout include adp  amd  bear stearns  circuit city  citigroup  department of energy  deutsche bank  freddie mac  fannie mae  kmart  lowe s  marriott  national institutes of health  ritz camera  safeway  time warner cable  us postal service and verizon 
in the north america segment  we have been largely successful when competitively bidding for large deployments of linux in enterprises running mission critical applications 
large enterprises choose novell for their mission critical deployments of linux for several reasons our expertise in enterprise linux integration  our year experience in delivering enterprise class support  and the breadth of our integrated  linux ready solutions 
in  we must continue further to develop and deliver migration tools  education and training in order to facilitate customers implementing open source technologies 
we intend to grow our position in the identity and resource management market by offering the most comprehensive suite of products that address customer problems in the areas of security  compliance  risk mitigation and systems management 
this requires enterprises to cost effectively secure and novell annual report n 
table of contents protect business assets without compromising new business opportunities or reducing operational effectiveness 
organizations must also manage their heterogeneous it environments in a cost effective manner while ensuring compliance with business and it management processes 
novell s unique role based  policy driven approach has been well received and our business in this area continues to grow at or above industry rates 
our proven track record of successful implementations  experience and technology  and our partners expertise provide the most comprehensive identity driven computing solutions in the industry today 
our planned release of additional identity and resource management products in fiscal  should provide additional strength to this product line 
adoption of novell s identity solutions requires specialized expertise at the customer to deploy and maintain the novell product set 
acquisition of these skills is not seen as a deterrent to purchase  however it may delay some purchasing decisions as customers fully evaluate the total cost of ownership over less integrated alternatives 
novell must stabilize the decline of its revenue from traditional products  such as netware 
novell s traditional revenue base is an important source of cash flow  and a potential opportunity for us to sell more products and services 
with the release of our open enterprise server oes product in march  we have taken steps to help maintain that installed base and address revenue declines of these products 
oes is a package of network services  such as network file and print services  deployable on either netware or suse linux operating systems 
oes offers customers a clear migration path to our linux products  including migrating from competitive platforms 
in  we will continue to work with our customers to help them migrate from netware to oes with tools  training and education and to clearly articulate the return on investment of upgrading to linux versus proprietary platforms 
we have re architected our go to market plans  selecting key geographies in which to deploy our resources and clearly defining our partner and channel strategy 
in addition  we have restructured our sales incentive plans to motivate our direct sales and channel partners to focus on key product areas globally 
we have also created a new positioning for the field and customers  centered on the concept of software for the open enterprise  with solutions in five key technology areas data center  security and identity management  resource management  desktop  and workgroup 
our field resources have been trained and are now helping customers solve problems in these five key areas 
our go to market plans face risk primarily from larger competitors who may outspend our sales and marketing efforts in key geographic areas 
in addition to our strategic initiatives  we have made a number of operational improvements in our business in november  we undertook a significant restructuring action as part of our ongoing transition to linux and identity management and fiscal year planning 
we are concentrating our resources on key growth opportunities in the linux  open source  identity and resource management markets to better align our costs with our revenue opportunities and our overall business strategy 
to achieve greater operational efficiencies in the business  we are also focused on eliminating non core assets 
in connection with our restructuring  we streamlined our field operations  segmenting our markets into what we consider to be primary markets large  established markets where novell has a significant customer presence and the ability to deliver the range of novell products directly to the customer and emerging markets  where we will look more to partners in our go to market and delivery 
we believe this reorganization will also help us to leverage our direct sales force more effectively 
cash flow from operations is our principal source of liquidity 
we received a million net cash infusion from the settlement of certain netware related claims with microsoft in november the restructuring involved the elimination or cutback of certain product and service offerings 
we expect that the annualized run rate cost savings to be realized as a result of this restructuring will be approximately million 
some of these cuts are expected to negatively impact revenue in fiscal novell annual report n 
table of contents year this negative impact does not include continued expected declines in our traditional business revenue  which was also a significant factor in our restructuring decision 
our strong working capital will help facilitate the implementation of our transition  as well to quickly respond to market developments and business opportunities that may arise 
critical accounting policies an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires us to make an accounting estimate based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time an accounting estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially change the financial statements 
we consider accounting policies related to revenue recognition and related reserves  impairment of long lived assets  and valuation of deferred tax assets and loss contingency accruals to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition and related reserves 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of software licenses  software maintenance  upgrade protection  subscriptions of suse linux enterprise server sles  technical support  training  and consulting services 
our customers include distributors  who sell our products to resellers  dealers  and vars  oems  who integrate our products with their products or solutions  vars  who provide solutions across multiple vertical market segments which usually includes services  and end users  who may purchase our products and services directly from novell or from other partners or resellers 
except for our suse linux product  distributors do not order to stock and only order products when they have an end customer order  which they present to us 
with respect to our suse linux product  distributors place orders and the product is then sold through to end customers principally through the retail channel 
oems report the number of copies duplicated and sold via an activity or royalty report 
software maintenance  upgrade protection  technical support  and subscriptions of sles typically involve one to three year contract terms 
our standard contracts offer a day right of return 
revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
when an arrangement does not require significant production  modification or customization of software or does not contain services considered to be essential to the functionality of the software  revenue is recognized when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we require evidence of an agreement with a customer specifying the terms and conditions of the products or services to be delivered typically in the form of a signed contract or statement of work accompanied by a purchase order 
delivery has occurred for software licenses  delivery takes place when the customer is given access to the software programs via access to a web site or shipped medium 
for services  delivery takes place as the services are provided 
the fee is fixed or determinable fees are fixed or determinable if they are not subject to a refund or cancellation and do not have payment terms that exceed our standard payment terms 
typical payment terms are net days 
collection is probable we perform a credit review of all customers with significant transactions to determine whether a customer is credit worthy and collection is probable 
prior novell established credit history  credit reports  financial statements  and bank references are used to assess credit worthiness 
novell annual report n 
table of contents in general  revenue for transactions that do not involve software customization or services considered essential to the functionality of the software is recognized as follows software license fees for our suse linux product are recognized when the product is sold through to an end customer  software license fees for sales through oems are recognized upon receipt of license activity or royalty reports  all other software license fees are recognized upon delivery of the software  software maintenance  upgrade protection  technical support  and subscriptions of sles are recognized ratably over the contract term  and consulting  training and other similar services are recognized as the services are performed 
if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if collection is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
we record provisions against revenue for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
we also record a provision to operating expenses for bad debts resulting from customers inability to pay for the products or services they have received 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and bad debt expense  analyses of credit memo data  and other known factors  such as bankruptcy 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not accurately reflect future returns or bad debts  adjustments to these reserves may be required that would increase or decrease revenue or net income 
many of our software arrangements include multiple elements 
such elements typically include any or all of the following software licenses  rights to additional software products  software maintenance  upgrade protection  technical support  training and consulting services 
for multiple element arrangements that do not involve significant modification or customization of the software and do not involve services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we allocate value to each element based on its relative fair value  if sufficient novell specific objective evidence of fair value exists for each element of the arrangement 
novell specific objective evidence of fair value is determined based on the price charged when each element is sold separately 
if sufficient novell specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  but does not exist for the delivered element  typically the software  then the residual method is used to allocate value to each element 
under the residual method  each undelivered element is allocated value based on novell specific objective evidence of fair value for that element  as described above  and the remainder of the total arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element  typically the software 
if sufficient novell specific objective evidence does not exist for all undelivered elements and the arrangement involves rights to unspecified additional software products  all revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
if the arrangement does not involve rights to unspecified additional software products  all revenue is initially deferred until typically the only remaining undelivered element is software maintenance or technical support  at which time the entire fee is recognized ratably over the remaining maintenance or support term 
in the case of multiple element arrangements that involve significant modification or customization of the software or involve services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  contract accounting is applied 
when novell specific objective evidence exists for software maintenance or technical support in arrangements requiring contract accounting  the consulting and license fees are combined and revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
the percentage of completion is generally calculated using estimated hours incurred to date relative to the total expected hours for the entire project 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates to complete or recognition of losses on contracts is reflected in the period in which the changes or losses become known 
the maintenance or support fee is unbundled from the other elements and revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance or support term 
novell annual report n 
table of contents when novell specific objective evidence does not exist for software maintenance or support  then all revenue is deferred until completion of the consulting services  at which time the entire fee is recognized ratably over the remaining maintenance or support period 
consulting project contracts are either time and materials or fixed price contracts 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized based on the proportional performance method  generally using estimated time to complete to measure the completed effort 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates to complete or recognition of losses on contracts is reflected in the period in which the changes or losses become known 
consulting revenue includes reimbursable expenses charged to our clients 
celerant recognizes consulting revenue on base fees  milestone fees and success fees 
base fees are the element of total fees that are recognized based on expected efforts to be expended on a project 
milestone fees are the element of total fees for the project that are not billed in accordance with the resources used  but are linked directly to the achievement of specified criteria  which release the milestone payments 
success fees are incremental fees based on results that exceed base deliverables on the project 
revenue derived from the achievement of criteria relating to project milestones or project results is recognized only when they have been accepted and approved by the customer 
base fees are recognized according to the proportional performance to date  which is measured by applying the completed effort to date to the total fees less project milestones and success fees of each project 
the completed effort to date is calculated as the proportion of man weeks incurred to date relative to the total expected man weeks for the entire project 
the cumulative impact of any revision in estimates to complete or the recognition of losses on contracts is reflected in the period in which the changes or losses become known 
celerant consulting revenue includes reimbursable expenses charged to our clients 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets include net fixed assets  long term investments  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
at october   our long lived assets included million of net fixed assets  million of long term investments  million of goodwill  and million of identifiable intangible assets 
property  plant  and equipment 
we periodically review our property  plant  and equipment for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could indicate an impairment include significant underperformance of the asset as compared to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the actual or intended use of the asset  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  the related estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset are compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if the sum of the estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying amount  we record an impairment charge based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value  which we estimate based on discounted expected future cash flows 
in determining whether an asset is impaired  we must make assumptions regarding recoverability of costs  estimated future cash flows from the asset  intended use of the asset and other related factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
long term investments 
the fair value of the long term investments is dependent on the actual financial performance of the companies or venture funds in which we have invested  the investees market value  and the volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these private equity investments  we consider these factors as well as the historical and forecasted financial performance of our investees  the volatility inherent in the external market for these investments  and estimated potential for investment recovery based on all these factors 
if any of these factors indicate that the investment has become other than temporarily impaired  we may have to record novell annual report n 
table of contents additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
during fiscal   and we recognized million  million  and million of impairment losses related to our long term investments  respectively 
if general market conditions do not improve  or if any of the companies or venture funds included in long term investments do not meet performance goals  our investments could become other than temporarily impaired as their values decline  causing us to record further investment impairment charges 
as of october   we have commitments to contribute an additional million to certain of these ventures 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually as of august  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant  such as a material adverse change in the business 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
indefinite lived intangible assets are considered impaired if their carrying value exceeds their estimated fair value 
fair values are estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process requires subjective judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
changes to the estimates used in the analyses  including estimated future cash flows  could cause one or more of the reporting units or indefinite lived intangibles to be valued differently in future periods 
future analysis could potentially result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of up to million  the full amount of our goodwill  depending on the estimated value of the reporting units and the value of the net assets attributable to those reporting units at that time 
during the fourth quarters of fiscal   and  we completed our annual goodwill impairment reviews based on august    and balances  respectively  and determined that there was no goodwill impairment as of those dates 
these assessments are made at the reporting unit level  and therefore we could be subject to an impairment charge to goodwill or intangible assets if any one of the geographic segments or celerant does not perform in line with forecasts in the future 
in addition  changes in the assumptions used in the analyses could have changed the resulting outcomes 
for example  to estimate the fair value of our reporting units at august   we made estimates and judgments about future cash flows based on our fiscal forecast and current long range plans used to manage the business 
these long range estimates could change in the future depending on internal changes in our company as well as external factors 
future changes in estimates could possibly result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
developed technology and customer contractual relationships are amortized over three years as a cost of revenue 
patents are amortized over their estimated useful lives  generally ten years  as a cost of revenue 
customer contractual relationships are amortized over one to three years as a sales expense 
most of our trademarks trade names have indefinite lives and therefore are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
we review our finite lived intangible assets periodically for indicators of impairment in accordance with sfas no 
as described above 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for certain intangible assets we acquired as a part of the silverstream and suse acquisitions 
in fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge for certain intangible assets we acquired as a part of the silverstream acquisition 
deferred tax assets 
we perform quarterly and annual assessments of the realization of our deferred tax assets considering all available evidence  both positive and negative 
assessments of the realization of deferred tax assets require that management make significant judgments about many factors  including the amount and likelihood of future taxable income 
as a result of these assessments  we previously established valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets that were considered to be at risk due to their unique characteristics and limitations  such as capital loss carryovers and acquired tax attributes 
through the third quarter of fiscal  we concluded that it was more likely than not that the remaining recognized deferred tax assets would be realized 
the valuation allowance established in the fourth quarter of fiscal was novell annual report n 
table of contents recorded as a result of our analysis of the facts and circumstances at that time  which led us to conclude that we could no longer forecast future us taxable income under the more likely than not standard required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our cumulative pre tax book loss for three consecutive years ended october  imposed a high standard for compelling  positive evidence of the likelihood of  and ability to forecast  future taxable income in the near term 
as a result  in the fourth fiscal quarter  we provided a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets carried on our balance sheet 
during fiscal  we generated us pre tax income 
at october   we had been in a cumulative pre tax loss position for each of the last three years 
as a result  we continued to provide a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
we generated us pre tax income for fiscal however  most of the us earnings were attributable to the one time  discrete income from the microsoft settlement 
income from us operations  excluding income from the microsoft settlement  was slightly profitable 
substantial cumulative prior year us losses remain  and we accordingly continue to provide a full valuation allowance on our net us deferred tax assets at october  loss contingency accruals and restructurings 
we are required to make accruals for certain loss contingencies related to litigation and taxes 
we accrue these items in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires us to accrue for losses we believe are probable and can be reasonably estimated however  the estimation of the amount to accrue requires significant judgment 
litigation accruals require we make assumptions about the future outcome of each case based on current information 
tax accruals require we make assumptions based on the results of tax audits  past experience and interpretations of tax law 
when our restructurings include leased facilities  in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we are required to make assumptions about future sublease income  which would offset our costs and decrease our accrual 
from time to time  we are subjected to tax audits and must make assumptions about the outcome of the audit 
if any of the estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  or if actual outcomes are different than our estimates  we may be required to record additional charges or reduce our accruals 
during fiscal  we recorded a million adjustment to reduce previous restructuring accruals and a million adjustment to increase merger liabilities primarily due to changes in estimates we originally made regarding future subleases 
in fiscal  we recorded a million adjustment to a previous restructuring accrual due to changes in estimates we originally made regarding future sublease income  a million reduction of our litigation accrual due to changes in the estimated outcome of certain ongoing legal cases and million reduction to our income tax accrual to reflect current estimated tax exposures

software license revenue includes new and upgrade license revenue only 
maintenance and services includes sles subscriptions  upgrade protection contracts  and all other revenue deferred due to contract terms

linux platform revenue includes products and services  such as sles  oes  novell linux desktop  zenworks linux management  suse linux  technical support and other linux product and service revenue 
software licenses revenue decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to declines in license sales of workgroup products such as netware oes and groupwise 
in addition  the decrease is due novell annual report n 
table of contents to more of our customers purchasing under multiple product  multiple year subscription contracts  which we classify as maintenance and services 
maintenance and services revenue increased during fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to higher it consulting and services revenue of million resulting from the acquisition of salmon and increased revenue in all geographic regions  and million due to higher maintenance revenue  offset slightly by million of lower revenue from celerant 
the change in the mix of our revenue towards more maintenance and subscription contracts has also driven the increase in revenue in the maintenance and services category 
software license revenue decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of lower netware  groupwise and zenworks license sales 
revenue from netware licenses decreased by million or from fiscal to fiscal  revenue from groupwise licenses decreased million or from fiscal to fiscal  and revenue from zenworks licenses decreased by million or from fiscal to fiscal these decreases were offset somewhat by favorable foreign exchange rates  particularly in europe 
maintenance and services revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to increased global services and support revenue  which increased million or  the recognition of million of royalty revenue related to a favorable legal judgment against the canopy group  inc canopy wherein we recovered a royalty payment due under a licensing agreement  the addition of million in suse services revenue  and the benefit of favorable foreign exchange rates  primarily in europe

the overall increase in japan segment revenue for fiscal is primarily due to increased royalty revenue  offset somewhat by declining services revenue 
deferred revenue deferred revenue represents revenue that is expected to be recognized in future periods 
the majority of deferred revenue relates to maintenance contracts and subscriptions and is recognized ratably over the related service periods  typically one to three years 
the increase in the deferred revenue at october  compared to october  of million is primarily attributable to a million increase due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates  approximately million due to advanced invoicing of maintenance contract renewals and approximately million due to increases in maintenance and subscription contracts

oes has been shipping for only two quarters  and the customer adoption cycles are typically long  and we therefore continue to plan for declines in those legacy revenue streams

the increase in gross profit from maintenance and services for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to increased sales volume in the related sales category 
the decrease in gross profit from maintenance and services as a percentage of related revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the impact of the canopy royalty revenue recognized in fiscal  which did not have any costs associated with it  and a shift in the mix of revenue in this category to lower margin consulting services revenue  increased royalty costs and increased amortization of intangible assets associated with recent acquisitions 
the increase in gross profit from software licenses as a percentage of related revenue from fiscal to fiscal is due to an intangible asset impairment charge taken in fiscal against software licenses of million 
this charge related to intangible assets from the acquisition of silverstream 
the increase in gross profit from maintenance and services as a percentage of related revenue from fiscal to fiscal is primarily due to the recognition of million of revenue in connection with the canopy legal judgment during fiscal  which had relatively little corresponding cost of sales

recent pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued its final standard on accounting for share based payments  sfas no 
r  share based payment  which replaces sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
sfas no 
r requires all companies to measure compensation costs for all share based payments  including stock options  at fair value and expense such payments to the statement of operations over the related employee service period 
sfas no 
r will be effective for us beginning with our first quarter of fiscal as permitted by sfas no 
 we currently account for share based payments to employees using the apb no 
intrinsic value method and  therefore we generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it is not expected to have any impact on our overall financial position 
the precise impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r cannot be predicted at this time as it will depend in part on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had sfas no 
r been adopted in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas no 
 which is described in note q 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under the current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the adoption 
we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
sfas no 
r allows companies to choose one of three transition methods the modified prospective transition method without restatement  modified prospective transition method with restatement  or modified retroactive transition method 
we have chosen to use the modified prospective transition methodology without restatement 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december   however  sfas no 
does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements 
we do not believe adoption of sfas no 
will have an immediate material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and market prices of equity securities 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize currency forward contracts and currency options 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes  and no significant derivative financial instruments were outstanding at october  interest rate risk the primary objective of our short term investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our strategy is to invest in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in approximately a million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
market risk we also hold available for sale equity securities in our short term investment portfolio 
as of october   gross unrealized gains  before tax effect on the short term public equity securities totaled million 
a reduction in prices of of these short term equity securities would result in approximately a million decrease less than in the fair value of our short term investments 
in addition  we invest in equity securities issued by privately held companies that are included in our long term portfolio of investments  primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in thinly capitalized companies in the high technology industry sector or venture capital funds 
because of the nature of these investments  we are exposed to equity price risks 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in equity prices of long term equity securities would result in approximately a million decrease in the fair value of our long term securities 
foreign currency risk we use derivatives to hedge those current net assets and liabilities that  when re measured or settled according to accounting principles generally accepted in the us  impact our consolidated statement of operations 
currency forward contracts are utilized in these hedging programs 
all forward contracts entered into by us are components of hedging programs and are entered into for the sole purpose of hedging an existing novell annual report n 
table of contents or anticipated currency exposure  not for speculation or trading purposes 
gains and losses on these currency forward contracts would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses on the net foreign currency assets and liabilities that they hedge  resulting in negligible net gain or loss overall on the hedged exposures 
when hedging balance sheet exposures  all gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income expense in the same period as when the gains and losses on re measurement of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities occur 
all gains and losses related to foreign exchange contracts are included in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
if we did not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate movement  an increase or decrease of in exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in income before taxes of approximately million 
this number represents the exposure related to balance sheet re measurement only and assumes that all currencies move in the same direction at the same time relative to the us dollar 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at october  actual results may differ materially
