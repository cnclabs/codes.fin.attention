item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general consol energy had net income of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net income for the period was improved due to the million gain on sale of interest in cnx gas corporation 
on june   the board of directors of consol energy authorized the incorporation of cnx gas corporation cnx gas 
on june  cnx gas was incorporated and issued shares of its par value common stock to consolidation coal company  a wholly owned subsidiary of consol energy 
cnx gas was incorporated to conduct consol energy s gas exploration and production activities 
in august  consol energy contributed or leased substantially all of the assets of its gas business  including all of consol energy s rights to coalbed methane associated with billion tons of coal reserves owned or controlled by consol energy as well as all of consol energy s rights to conventional gas 
in exchange for consol energy s contribution of assets  consol energy received approximately million shares of cnx gas common stock 
cnx gas entered into various agreements with consol energy that define various operating and service relationships between the two companies 
in august  cnx gas entered into an agreement to sell approximately million shares in a private transaction and granted a day option to purchase an additional million shares 
in august  cnx gas closed on the sale of all million shares 
the shares were sold to qualified institutional  foreign and accredited investors in a private transaction exempt from registration under rule a  regulation s and regulation d 
in august  a registration statement on form s was filed with the sec with respect to those shares 
the registration statement was declared effective on january  the proceeds approximately  including proceeds from the sale of the additional million shares were used to pay a special dividend to consol energy 
the gain recognized on this transaction was  the proceeds received less the financial basis in the assets and liabilities given up were recognized as a gain on sale of a subsidiary s stock in the year ended december  in the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  no deferred tax was provided on this transaction as current tax law provides a means by which the excess of the reported amount of this investment over its tax basis can be recovered tax free 
also  management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause cnx gas to leave the consolidated tax group 
improved net income was also due to higher average sales prices for coal and gas 
this increase was offset  in part by costs related to the buchanan mine fire and by higher cost per units sold for both coal and gas 
higher coal unit costs were primarily due to higher supply costs  higher labor costs  higher contract mining fee costs and higher other post employment benefits per unit sold 
higher gas unit costs were primarily attributable to increased royalty expense  changes in imbalance amounts and firm transportation costs 
net income in the period included million due to a cumulative effect of change in accounting for workers compensation 
total coal sales for the year ended december  were million tons  including sales by consolidated variable interest entities  of which million tons were produced by consol energy operations  or sold from inventory of company produced coal 
this compares with total coal sales of million tons for the year ended december   of which million tons were produced by consol energy operations or sold from inventory of company produced coal 
overall  production of million tons  including production from consolidated variable interest entities and our portion of equity affiliates  increased million tons from the period 
bailey mine  mcelroy mine  loveridge mine and emery mine set production records in  which offset the estimated loss of approximately million tons from the buchanan mine due to problems that occurred there during the year 
sales volumes of coalbed methane gas  including a percentage of the sales of equity affiliates equal to our interest in these affiliates  decreased to billion cubic feet for the year ended december  compared with billion cubic feet in the year ended december  the decrease in sales volumes is primarily due to the loss of billion cubic feet related to the buchanan fire and billion cubic feet from curtailments on shipment capacity on the columbia interstate pipeline 
our average sales price for coalbed methane gas  including sales of equity affiliates increased to per thousand cubic feet in the period compared with per thousand cubic feet in the period 

table of contents in september  the buchanan mine  near keen mountain  virginia  suspended production following a problem with the mine s skip hoist mechanism 
the hoist was repaired and production resumed on december  it is estimated that the mine lost approximately million tons of production during the period that production was suspended 
during that period  the company invoked the force majeure provision on all sales contracts for buchanan mine coal 
in october  david c 
hardesty  president west virginia university  was elected to the consol energy board of directors 
in december  the board of directors authorized a common share repurchase program of up to million during the month period beginning january  and ended december  consol has repurchased  shares through february  at an average price of under this program 
in january  consol energy entered into a coal sales agreement with american electric power aep for the sale of up to million tons of high btu bituminous coal to various aep coal fired power stations over a year period beginning in and running through the coal will come from the shoemaker and mcelroy mines and will be shipped to aep power plants that have or will be equipped to have scrubbers 
as a result of the new contract  we will begin a major capital improvement project for the shoemaker mine  replacing the mine s older  rail haulage system with a new  more efficient conveyor belt haulage system 
in january  consol energy purchased mon river towing and jar barge lines  lp from the guttman group  a private concern 
the acquisition will increase the size of consol energy s towboat fleet from to and increase the number of barges from about to more than  increasing coal transportation capacity from million tons to about million tons 
the transaction closed on january  on january   cnx gas corporation s registration statement on form s was declared effective by the us securities and exchange commission 
this registration statement covers  shares of cnx gas common stock 
these shares have been approved for listing on the new york stock exchange under the symbol cxg 
consol energy owns approximately of cnx gas outstanding shares 
over the next two years  electricity generation in the united states is forecast to grow approximately per annum  absent any adverse weather impacts 
according to industry reports  coal inventories are significantly below normal in the united states and could add million tons of demand in furthermore  natural gas prices remain high and make gas powered generation more expensive than that of coal 
these factors should contribute to an already tight supply demand balance for us thermal steam coal 
the united states energy information administration eia has forecasted that over the next four years there are more than gigawatts of planned capacity additions from new generators that will use coal as an energy source requiring an estimated million tons of high btu coal per year 
in addition  there are nearly gigawatts of existing coal fired power scheduled to be retrofitted with scrubbers over the same time frame 
consol energy expects to benefit from the long term demand for high btu northern appalachia coal due to new and retrofitted scrubbers on power plants geographically located near consol s mines  the growing demand for electricity generation as consumers use more electricity dependent devices  the geological limitations of central appalachian coal  and the potential transportation issues associated with lower btu coal 
while the overall market for coal remains positive  we believe the growth in demand for northern appalachian coal will exceed the industry s organic growth by a wide margin 
the transaction with aep that we announced earlier this month is indicative of the way we see this market evolving 
major coal burning power generators are beginning to move to the high btu products available close to their plants as their scrubber construction projects are completed 

table of contents results of operations twelve months ended december  compared with twelve months ended december  net income net income changed primarily due to the following items table in millions dollar variance percentage change coal sales produced and purchased outside and related party produced gas sales purchased gas sales gain on sale of interest in cnx gas other sales and other income total revenue and other income coal cost of goods sold produced and purchased produced gas cost of goods sold purchased gas cost of goods sold other cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold other total costs earnings before income taxes  minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting income tax expense benefit earnings before minority interest and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle minority interest earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting for the period were improved primarily due to the gain on sale of interest in cnx gas 
in august  cnx gas  a subsidiary of consol energy  sold million shares in a private transaction 
cnx gas received proceeds of million  which it used to pay a special dividend to consol energy 
the proceeds received less the financial basis in the assets and liabilities given up by consol energy was recognized as a gain on sale of a subsidiary s stock in the year ended december  the pre tax gain recognized on this transaction was million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards board no 
 accounting for income taxes  no deferred tax has been provided on this transaction as current tax law provides a means by which the excess of the reported amount of this investment over its tax basis can be recovered tax free 
also  management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause cnx gas to leave the consolidated tax group 
earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting were also improved due to increased average sales prices for both coal and gas and increased volume of produced coal sold 
these increases were offset  in part  by costs related to the buchanan mine fire and by higher cost per units sold for both coal and gas 
higher coal unit costs were primarily due to increased supply costs  higher labor costs  higher contractor mining fees and higher other post employment benefits 
higher gas unit costs were primarily due to increased royalty expense  imbalance charges and firm transportation expenses 
net income in the period included a cumulative effect of change in 
table of contents accounting related to workers compensation 
effective january   consol energy changed our method of accounting for workers compensation 
prior to the change  consol energy recorded our workers compensation liability on an undiscounted basis 
under the new method  consol energy records our liability on a discounted basis 
revenue revenue and other income increased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change sales produced coal outside and related party purchased coal produced gas purchased gas industrial supplies other total sales freight revenue gain on sale of of cnx gas other income total revenue and other income the increase in company produced coal sales revenue  including related party  during the period was due mainly to the increase in average sales price per ton and increased sales volumes 
variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average sales price per ton the increase in average sales price primarily reflects stronger prices negotiated in and early resulting from an overall improvement in prices in the eastern coal market for domestic and foreign power generators and steel producers 
the increase was also attributable to pricing premiums due to improved quality on coal shipments 
the increase in tons sold was due primarily to increased production at mcelroy  loveridge  bailey  the reactivation of emery mine in august and the opening of the miller creek complex in october these production increases were offset  in part  by a decrease in tons sold due to lower production at buchanan and various contractor locations 
the mcelroy production increase is related to running two longwall mining units in the period compared to running one longwall mining unit in the period 
the loveridge production increase is due to the mine operating for the full twelve months of the period compared to only a portion of the period due to the fire at this location in bailey production increases were due to increased productivity in the period to period comparison 
buchanan production decreased in the period due to a fire that developed in the mine after a large rock fall behind the longwall mining section on february  the mine was temporarily sealed in order to extinguish the fire 
buchanan resumed production on june  on september   buchanan experienced an accident with the skip hoist which brings the coal from underground to the surface 
the mine was idled until repairs to the skip hoist were completed 
the mine resumed production on december  
table of contents company purchased coal sales revenue remained consistent in the period to period comparison due to an increase in average sales price per ton of purchased coal  offset by reduced sales volumes 
variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average sales price per ton the increased average sales price is primarily due to sales of purchased coal tons being sold in higher priced export and metallurgical markets 
increased revenue from higher average sales prices were offset by lower sales volumes of purchased coal in the period compared to the period 
the increase in gas sales revenue was due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold in the period compared to the period 
variance percentage change produced gas sales volumes in billion gross cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet including effects of derivative transactions we believe the gas market price increases were largely driven by continued concerns over levels of north american gas production  as well as increased oil prices and favorable economic conditions in the united states that encourage demand for natural gas 
the adverse affect of the hurricane season also shut in significant portions of gulf coast gas  increasing the tight supply  and leading to even higher prices in consol energy enters into various physical gas swap transactions with both gas marketers and other counterparties for terms varying in length 
consol energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges 
these gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these physical and financial hedges represented approximately of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
despite the loss of approximately billion cubic feet of gas related to the buchanan mine incident and billion cubic feet due to maintenance related capacity constraints on consol energy s transportation capacity on the columbia interstate pipeline  sales volumes are only slightly lower in the period compared to the period 
we were able to offset these production losses with additional volumes coming on line from our on going drilling program  and by successfully initiating a frac well enhancement and stimulation program on wells unaffected by the mine fire 
as a result of increased demand for pipeline use on the columbia interstate pipeline  and the potential for curtailment on portions of the shipment capacity allocated to consol energy  we purchased firm transportation capacity on the pipeline during this arrangement offset a portion of the expected impact from periodic curtailments 
in april  we were given notice by columbia regarding reductions in allowable gas flow due to routine maintenance and construction activities 
interruptible gas was completely shut in and our contracted firm transportation flows were reduced by which resulted in reduced revenues of million along with other smaller curtailments throughout the year that were also eventually lifted 
although we anticipate that these pipeline constraints will be an on going issue for the foreseeable future  we also intend to gain access to the east tennessee natural gas etng pipeline  which is south of our central appalachia operations 
etng has received the approval of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for the construction of a mile lateral pipeline  called jewell ridge lateral  that will transport gas from our central appalachia operations to etng s major transportation pipeline to the south 
the ferc approval is subject to certain conditions  which etng is working to satisfy 
jewell ridge lateral is expected to be in service in the summer of and will provide us with an alternative transportation route to the northeast markets we currently serve as well as access to east coast markets 

table of contents additionally  we simultaneously purchased gas from and sold gas to other counterparties between the segmentation and interruptible pools on the columbia interstate pipeline in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  we have increased our revenues and our costs 
sales of purchased gas volumes have increased primarily due to consol energy utilizing higher levels of firm transportation throughout the period that required us to purchase from and sell to other counterparties 
consol energy began to enter into this type of transaction in may of variance percentage change purchased gas sales volumes in billion gross cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet the million increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was primarily due to increased sales volumes 
the million increase in other sales was attributable to revenues from river barge towing 
under the jones act bowater exemption  because consol energy was more than owned by a foreign company  we were prohibited from providing river barge towing to third parties 
consol energy began third party river barge towing shortly after rwe ag divested their ownership interest in the period as we were no longer restricted by the jones act 
freight revenue is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc 
used for the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred 
on june   the board of directors of consol energy authorized the incorporation of cnx gas corporation cnx gas 
on june  cnx gas was incorporated and issued shares of its par value common stock to consolidation coal company  a wholly owned subsidiary of consol energy 
cnx gas was incorporated to conduct consol energy s gas exploration and production activities 
in august  consol energy contributed or leased substantially all of the assets of its gas business  including all of consol energy s rights to coalbed methane associated with billion tons of coal reserves owned or controlled by consol energy as well as all of consol energy s rights to conventional gas 
in exchange for consol energy s contribution of assets  consol energy received approximately million shares of cnx gas common stock 
cnx gas entered into various agreements with consol energy that define various operating and service relationships between the two companies 
in august  cnx gas entered into an agreement to sell approximately million shares in a private transaction and granted a day option to purchase an additional million shares 
in august  cnx gas closed on the sale of all million shares 
the shares were sold to qualified institutional  foreign and accredited investors in a private transaction exempt from registration under rule a  regulation s and regulation d 
in august  a registration statement on form s was filed with the sec with respect to those shares 
the registration statement was declared effective on january  the proceeds approximately  including proceeds from the sale of the additional million shares were used to pay a special dividend to consol energy 
the gain recognized on this transaction was  
table of contents other income consists of interest income  gain or loss on the disposition of assets  equity in earnings of affiliates  service income  royalty income  rental income and miscellaneous income 
dollar variance percentage change royalty income buchanan fire business interruption proceeds gain on sale of assets interest income harmar trust settlement equity in income loss of affiliates other miscellaneous total other income royalty income has increased due primarily to third parties producing more tonnage from consol owned property in the period to period comparison 
buchanan mine experienced a fire that developed in the mine after a large rock fall behind our longwall mining section on february  the mine was temporarily sealed in order to extinguish the fire 
coal production resumed on june  consol energy filed an insurance claim for reimbursement of various costs and business interruption related to the fire at buchanan mine 
during the three months ended december   consol energy received an advance on the filed claim from the insurance companies 
the portion of the advance related to fire abatement and various related costs relieved the previously established receivable 
the portion related to business interruption was recognized as other income in the period received 
the decrease in gain on sale of assets in the period reflects consol energy s sale of stock in our wholly owned subsidiary cnx australia pty limited to certain affiliates of amci  inc for million  the assumption of approximately million of debt  and associated interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges in the period 
the sale resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
the additional gain on sale of assets in the period is primarily related to the sale of several previously closed operations 
the period gain on sale of assets is primarily related to the sale of several previously closed operations 
interest income increased in the period to period comparison due to our improved cash position 
cash and cash equivalent balances at december  were million compared to million at december  the improved cash position was primarily due to the august sale of interest in cnx gas stock 
the private sale of this stock resulted in million of proceeds 
other income from the harmar environmental trust the trust settlement was attributable to the civil division of the court of common pleas of allegheny county s decision to terminate a trust among consol energy and other parties 
the trust was established in to provide funding for water treatment related to the now closed harmar mine 
other parties funded the trust 
consol energy was responsible to complete water treatment activities  but all costs associated with these activities were funded by the trust agreement 
any excess funding upon completion of water treatment or a specified date in the future was to be distributed to parties that originally funded the trust 
in the decision  all previously funded  but unused  amounts remaining in the trust were distributed 
consol energy s portion of the distributed funds  million  was placed into an escrow account pending provision of financial assurance supporting consol energy s water treatment obligations 
consol energy provided the financial assurance for this obligation and the funds were released from escrow 
consol energy is responsible for the ongoing water treatment at this facility 
consol energy recorded the funds and the present value of the water treatment liability resulting in million of income in the period 

table of contents the equity income of affiliates in the period is attributable to consol energy s portion of a gain on sale of land by an affiliate 
the equity losses of affiliates in the period is due mainly to the equity losses related to glennies creek mine operating results prior to the sale that occurred in february an additional million increase in other income was due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
costs dollar variance percentage change cost of good sold and other charges produced coal purchased coal produced gas purchased gas industrial supplies closed and idle mines other total cost of goods sold increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to an increase in cost per ton of produced coal sold and a increase in sales volumes 
variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton average cost of goods sold and other charges for produced coal increased due mainly to increased unit costs 
this increase is attributable to higher supply costs  higher labor costs  higher contract mining fee costs and higher other post employment benefits per unit sold 
higher supply costs were attributable to increased maintenance costs and increased cost for steel  petroleum products and chemicals  such as magnetite  used in the mining and coal preparation process 
higher supply costs were also related to certain locations being in difficult mining conditions which increase costs on a per unit of output basis 
increased labor costs were attributable to increased employee counts and increased wages at certain mining operations 
mancounts have been increased in certain locations to maintain development rates ahead of the longwall mining units 
labor rates were increased in order to stay competitive in certain labor markets 
increased contract mining fees were attributable to increased fees negotiated with the contractors used primarily in our central appalachian operations 
increased other post employment benefits were primarily due to the impact of cost increases for medical and drug benefits 
increased produced coal costs of goods sold was also due to higher sales volumes in the period compared to the period 
these increases in costs were offset  in part  by reduced combined fund premiums related to a premium differential that was paid in the period 
also  consol energy currently anticipates that the fund premiums will increase approximately million for the plan year beginning january  due to the recent insured losses at our mines  property and business interruption insurance coverage may be difficult to renew at the current pricing levels and terms 
purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges increased in the period to period comparison 
variance percentage change purchased tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton 
table of contents the higher average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to overall increases in prices for domestic coals  offset by reduced volumes of purchased coal sold 
gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due primarily to increased unit costs 
variance percentage change gas sales volumes in billion gross cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet the increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was primarily attributable to increased royalty expense  offset  in part by changes in imbalance amounts 
royalty expense increased approximately per thousand cubic feet in the period compared to the period primarily due to the increase in average sales price per thousand cubic feet in the same periods 
additionally  the average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold increased due to a increase per thousand cubic feet of gas sold related to the purchase of firm transportation capacity on the columbia interstate pipeline because of potential curtailments on portions of shipment capacity allocated to consol energy as a result of increased demand for pipeline access in the period 
cost per unit increased per thousand cubic feet of gas sold due to higher well maintenance fees 
these fees have increased due to more wells being serviced in the increase in average unit costs was also due to an increase of approximately per thousand cubic feet in the period to period comparison due to changes in the gas imbalance amounts 
because contracted quantities of gas delivered to the pipeline rarely equal physical deliveries to customers  consol energy is responsible for monitoring this imbalance and requesting adjustments to contracted volumes as circumstances warrant 
the increase in imbalance cost per unit sold was offset by corresponding increases in gas sales revenue 
in addition  unit costs increased per thousand cubic feet due to additional power expense as a result of converting several compressors from gas powered to electric powered in the period 
an increase of per thousand cubic feet was attributable to various costs which were incurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
in connection with the purchase of firm transportation capacity on the columbia pipeline  we purchased from and sold to other gas suppliers  which increased our revenues and our costs 
consol energy believes this type of transaction may continue as a result of increased capacity demands on the columbia pipeline 
the period included a smaller volume of firm transportation activity as we did not begin to purchase this capacity until may of purchased gas information is as follows variance percentage change purchased gas sales volumes in billion gross cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet industrial supplies cost of goods sold have increased million primarily due to higher sales volumes 
closed and idle mine cost of goods sold was million lower in the period compared to the period primarily due to lower workers compensation expense 
workers compensation expense related to closed and idled locations has decreased million primarily due to the actuarial effects of several law changes in the state of west virginia related to workers compensation 
lower expense was also due to emery being active for all of the period compared to being idled for most of the period 
other reductions in closed and idle mine cost of goods sold were due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
these improvements were offset  in part  by higher expenses related to mine closing  perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liability adjustments that were a result of updated engineering surveys 
survey adjustments resulted in million of additional expense in the period for closed and idled locations compared to the results of the survey adjustments in the period 

table of contents miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change incentive compensation buchanan mine fire buchanan skip hoist accident sales contract buy outs bank fees litigation settlements and contingencies coal property holding costs stock based compensation expense accounts receivable securitization fees other post employee benefit curtailment gain buckeye landfill superfund site liability transfer miscellaneous transactions total miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges incentive compensation expense increased due to an increase in the projected amount expected to be paid out to employees for the period compared to the the incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when consol energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets 
consol energy s buchanan mine  located near keen mountain  virginia  experienced a large rock fall behind our longwall mining section on february  while caving behind the longwall is a normal part of the mining process  the size of this cave in created a large air pressure wave that disrupted ventilation and also caused an ignition of methane gas in the area 
consol energy temporarily sealed the mine in order to extinguish the fire that developed after the ignition 
various materials  including nitrogen foam and water were pumped into the mine in order to accelerate the process of creating an inert environment within the mine to extinguish the fire 
coal production resumed on june  costs of goods sold incurred  net of expected insurance recovery  for the year ended december  were million 
the buchanan mine was idled on september  following a problem with the mine s skip hoist mechanism 
repairs to the skip hoist shaft and structures were completed and the mine resumed production on december  expenses of approximately million related to the damaged area were incurred during this time frame 
also  approximately million were capitalized related to the installation and replacement of equipment and facilities damaged in the accident 
we plan to file property damage and business interruption claims related to this incident 
as of december   no insurance receivables have been recognized for these anticipated claims 
in the and periods  agreements were made to buy out sales contracts with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher pricing 
bank fees remained consistent in the period to period comparison 
litigation settlements and contingencies increased in the period compared to the period 
the increase is attributable to a proposed settlement agreement with certain lessors in western kentucky which would require the transfer of certain properties and permits  as well as a cash payment to the lessors  with the lessors assuming all reclamation liability for the mine property which is being transferred 
various other contingencies were incurred in both periods  none of which were individually material 
coal property holding costs increased in the period primarily due to leasehold surrenders that occurred in 
table of contents in april  consol energy began to issue restricted stock units as part of its equity incentive plan 
compensation cost for the restricted stock units is based upon the closing share price at the date of grant and is recognized over the vesting period of the units 
the increase in stock based compensation expense in the period is due to compensation cost for the grants being recognized for the full period as well as additional compensation costs for restricted stock unit grants that occurred in the period 
accounts receivable securitization fees remained consistent in the period to period comparison 
due to the restructuring that occurred in december  a curtailment gain related to the other post employment benefit plan of approximately million was recognized in the period 
due to consol energy s measurement date being september  the gain was not able to be recognized in the financial statements until the quarter ended march  in april  consol energy entered into an environmental liability transfer and indemnity agreement that transferred our liability related to the buckeye landfill superfund site to another party 
in  consol energy was named a potentially responsible party related to the buckeye landfill superfund site and accordingly recognized an estimated liability for remediation of this site 
the transfer and indemnity transaction resulted in the reversal of the remaining liability and the recognition of approximately million of income 
miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges increased million due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc 
used for the customers to whom consol energy contractually provides transportation 
freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billing equals the transportation expense 
dollar variance percentage change freight expense selling  general and administrative costs have increased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change professional consulting and other purchased services wages and salaries other total selling  general and administrative costs of professional consulting and other purchased services were higher in the period compared to the period primarily due to services provided related to various corporate initiatives 
wages and salaries have increased in the period due to additional employees hired in 
table of contents depreciation  depletion and amortization decreased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change coal gas production gathering total gas other total depreciation  depletion and amortization the decrease in coal depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to the acceleration of approximately million of depreciation for equipment and facilities at rend lake and other idle mines in the period 
consol energy s management reviewed the assets at these idled locations in conjunction with changes in mine plans for these locations 
no plan of use for these items was determined 
these pieces of equipment and facilities were considered abandoned and estimated useful lives were adjusted accordingly 
rend lake and the other idled locations have existing coal reserves that may be accessed through new facilities or from other active locations 
this decrease was offset  in part  by additional equipment being placed in service at active locations  such as mcelroy mine  bailey mine and enlow mine  after the period 
increases were also attributable to expansion projects  such as mcelroy and bailey refuse area and plant expansion  that were completed and in service in the period 
the increase in gas production depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily due to higher unit of production rates in the period compared to the period 
rates are generally calculated using the net book value of assets at the end of the year divided by proven developed reserves 
gathering depreciation  depletion and amortization is recorded on the straight line method and increased due to additional assets coming on line in interest expense decreased in the period compared to the period 
dollar variance percentage change short term borrowings year and year secured notes other total interest expense interest expense decreased primarily due to a reduction in the weighted average outstanding balance under short term borrowings in the period compared to the period 
the weighted average outstanding balance was approximately million in the period compared to million in the period 
the decrease in interest expense related to the year and year secured notes is attributable to the scheduled long term debt payment of million for the year secured note in june other interest expense increased due to reduced amounts of interest capitalized in the period compared to the period 
the reduced capitalized interest was attributable to the lower level of capital projects funded from operating cash flow  primarily due to the completion of the mcelroy expansion project 

table of contents taxes other than income increased primarily due to the following items dollar variance percentage change production taxes coal gas total production taxes other taxes coal gas other other total taxes other than income increased coal production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes and higher black lung excise taxes attributable to higher coal volumes and higher average sales price 
increased gas production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes attributable to higher average sales price for gas 
other coal taxes and other taxes have increased due primarily to increased franchise taxes related to the sale of interest in cnx gas 
other coal taxes have also increased due to lower miscellaneous tax credits from the state of virginia  which are based on tonnage produced in that state 
due to buchanan mine production being idled from mid september to mid december  virginia based production for the fourth quarter was lower than production for the fourth quarter income taxes variance percentage change earnings before income taxes tax expense benefit effective income tax rate consol energy s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was impacted by the gain of million resulting from the sale of interest in cnx gas stock  as previously discussed 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  no deferred tax has been provided on this transaction as current tax law provides a means by which the excess of the reported amount of this investment over its tax basis can be recovered tax free 
also  management has no current intention of entering into a transaction that would cause cnx gas to leave the consolidated tax group 
consol energy s effective tax rate is also sensitive to changes in the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information 
minority interest represents the of cnx gas net income which consol energy does not own 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle effective january   consol energy changed our method of accounting for workers compensation 
prior to the change  consol energy recorded our workers compensation liability on an undiscounted basis 
under the new method  consol energy recorded our liability on a discounted actuarial basis  using various 
table of contents assumptions  including discount rate and future cost trends 
we believe this actuarial approach is more explicit in its methodology  which should lead to better estimates of the liability and related periodic costs 
the change is also preferable because it aligns the accounting with our other long term employee benefit obligations  which are recorded on a discounted basis 
additionally  it provides a better comparison with our industry peers  the majority of which record the workers compensation liability on a discounted basis 
as a result of the change  consol energy reduced our workers compensation liability by million and reduced the related deferred tax asset by million 
the cumulative effect adjustment recognized upon adoption was a gain of million  net of a tax cost of approximately million 
results of operations twelve months ended december  compared with twelve months ended december  amounts reported in millions net income net income changed primarily due to the following items dollar variance percentage change coal sales produced and purchased gas sales produced gas sales purchased other sales and other income total revenue and other income coal cost of goods sold produced and purchased produced gas cost of goods sold purchased gas cost of goods sold other cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold depreciation  depletion and amortization taxes other than income other total costs earnings loss before income tax and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income taxes earnings loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting cumulative effect of change in accounting net income loss net income for was improved due to increased coal and gas sales volumes and increased average sales prices for both coal and gas 
pre tax earnings also improved million due to the recognition of the favorable effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of as of march  in accordance with accounting guidance 
also  net income was improved million due to the gain on sale of the stock of consol energy s wholly owned subsidiary  cnx australia pty limited  to certain affiliates of amci  inc in addition  net income improved due to an increased tax benefit related to the release of million of contingent income tax liabilities resulting from the settlement of the federal  state and foreign income tax audits of prior years 
also  an additional million of income from the cumulative effect of change in accounting 
table of contents related to workers compensation was recognized in compared to million of income for mine closing  perpetual care and gas well closing costs recognized in these increases in net income were offset  in part  by higher cost of goods sold attributable to higher sales volumes of coal and gas and to higher unit costs for coal and gas produced 
higher cost per ton of coal produced was due mainly to increased labor  supply and combined fund premiums per unit produced 
higher cost of gas produced was attributable to increased royalty cost and cost of firm transportation incurred by the gas operations 
increases in net income were also offset  in part  by million of accelerated depreciation  depletion and amortization taken for equipment and facilities at rend lake and other idled mining operations 
while there are no current plans for the use of the equipment or facilities  these mines have existing reserves that could be accessed from other locations or through new facilities 
revenue revenue and other income increased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change sales produced coal produced coal related party total produced coal purchased coal produced gas purchased gas industrial supplies other total sales freight revenue freight related party total freight other income total revenue and other income the increase in company produced coal sales revenue was due mainly to higher volumes sold during the period to period comparison and an increase in average sales price per ton 
variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average sales price per ton the increase in tons sold was due primarily to the loveridge mine resuming production in march and increased production at the mcelroy mine 
loveridge experienced a fire in february while it was in the process of developing a new underground area and therefore it had no production in mcelroy production increased due to the addition of a second longwall mining unit during and improved mining conditions compared to the increase in company produced coal sales revenue was also attributable to the increase in average sales price per ton sold 
the increase in average sales price reflects stronger prices negotiated in and an overall improvement in prices in the eastern coal market for coals sold to domestic and foreign utilities and for metallurgical coal 

table of contents the increase in company purchased coal sales revenue was due to higher average sales price per ton of purchased coal  offset  in part  by a decrease in tons of purchased coal sold 
variance percentage change purchased tons sold in millions average sales price per ton the increased average sales price is primarily due to some of the purchased coal tons being sold in higher priced export and metallurgical markets 
increased revenue from higher average sales prices were offset by lower sales volumes in compared to the increase in gas sales revenue was primarily due to a higher average sales price per thousand cubic feet and increased volumes sold in compared to variance percentage change produced gas gross sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet we believe that the gas market price increases were largely driven by continued concerns over levels of north american gas production  as well as increased oil prices and the economic recovery which resulted in greater electricity use in our principal markets 
consol energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length 
consol energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges 
these gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
in  these financial cash flow hedges represented of our produced gas sales volumes at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
we currently intend to cover approximately of our estimated production volume with gas swap transactions 
consol energy sold of its produced gas sales volumes in under fixed priced contracts at an average price of per thousand cubic feet compared to of its gas sales volumes under fixed price contracts in at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
higher sales volumes in were a result of wells coming on line from the ongoing drilling program  which allowed consol energy to take advantage of increased prices 
consol has entered into fixed price gas sales contracts with various marketers  representing approximately of total projected production  at an average price of mcf in order to manage price fluctuations and achieve more predictable cash flows 
due to the potential curtailment on portions of the shipment capacity allocated to consol energy as a result of increased demand for pipeline use on the columbia s interstate gas pipeline  referred to as the pipeline  consol energy purchased firm transportation capacity on the pipeline during the first firm transportation arrangement covered the may through october period 
in november  consol energy entered into an extended firm transportation arrangement for fixed capacity on the pipeline to offset a portion of the expected impact from the estimated curtailments 
this arrangement covers the november through october period 
as of february  the purchased fixed capacity on the pipeline represents approximately of our projected production for the same period 
in addition  in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers  we purchased gas from and sold gas to other gas suppliers  which increased our revenues and our costs 
variance percentage change purchased gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet average sales price per thousand cubic feet the increase in revenues from the sale of industrial supplies was due to increased sales volumes and prices 

table of contents the increase in other sales is primarily attributable to higher through put of outside coal volumes through our baltimore terminal 
freight revenue  outside and related party  is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc 
used for the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred 
other income consists of interest income  gain or loss on the disposition of assets  equity in earnings of affiliates  service income  royalty income  derivative gains and losses  rental income and miscellaneous income 
dollar variance percentage change gain on sale of assets royalty income harbor maintenance fee refund equity in loss of affiliates other miscellaneous total other revenue the gain on sale of assets is due mainly to consol energy s sale of stock in its wholly owned subsidiary  cnx australia pty limited  to certain affiliates of amci  inc for million 
certain affiliates of amci  inc 
also assumed approximately million of debt  and associated interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges 
cnx australia pty limited  through its wholly owned subsidiary consol energy australia pty limited  owned a interest in the glennies creek mine in new south wales  australia with its joint venture partner maitland main collieries pty limited  an affiliate of amci  inc the sale was completed on february  and resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
the gain on sale of assets in is also related to the assignment of certain coal leases  conveyance of associated surface property  the transfer of related mining permits and the related liabilities for a location in southern west virginia that resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
the additional gain on sale of assets in is related to the sale of several previously closed operations and the sale of surplus equipment 
the gain on sale of assets primarily was related to the expiration in of an option granted to a third party to purchase property for which consol energy received nonrefundable proceeds of million and gains from the sale of surplus equipment 
royalty income has increased due primarily to third parties producing additional tonnage and gas volumes from consol owned property in the period to period comparison 
other income for included a million harbor maintenance fee refund received from the federal government for prior claims related to harbor maintenance fees imposed by the federal statute that was subsequently declared unconstitutional 
these claims were pursued since  and we do not expect other refunds related to these claims 

table of contents the improvement in equity losses of affiliates is primarily attributable to consol energy s equity interest in the losses of glennies creek mine in consol energy s interest in this mine was sold in february costs dollar variance percentage change cost of goods sold and other charges produced coal purchased coal produced gas purchased gas industrial supplies closed and idle mines other total cost of goods sold increased cost of goods sold and other charges for company produced coal was due mainly to the increased produced tons sold and an increase in the average cost per ton of produced coal sold 
variance percentage change produced tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton produced tons sold increased due primarily to the loveridge mine resuming production in march and increased production at the mcelroy mine 
loveridge experienced a fire in february while it was in the process of developing a new underground area and therefore this location had no production in mcelroy production increased due to the addition of a second longwall mining unit during and improved mining conditions compared to several other mines increased production in compared with average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton also increased in compared to this increase was attributable to higher supply costs and labor per unit produced 
increased supply costs were related to the higher costs of materials  especially metal products  used in the mining process experienced in compared to increased labor and supply costs were also attributable to additional continuous miner shifts in continuous mining machines are used to mine the coal reserve in such a way that large  rectangular blocks of coal  called panels  are delineated underground in preparation for mining by larger more efficient longwall machines in mines equipped with these systems 
typically  mines attempt to delineate more than one panel in advance so that as the longwall machine completes the extraction of the coal in one panel  it can move without delay to another prepared panel 
continuous mining machines are more labor intensive and use more supplies per ton of coal produced than longwall mining systems 
also  consol energy production from non longwall mines required additional continuous mining machine shifts to maintain prior year production levels at these locations 
increased average cost per ton was also due to increased combined fund premiums related to a premium differential announced by the social security administration for the past eleven plan years for beneficiaries assigned to consol energy 
the increase was approximately million for the plan year beginning october   of which all has been expensed from october  through september  approximately million of expense was recognized in these increases in costs per ton were offset  in part  by reduced other post employment benefits due to the recognition of the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in 
table of contents purchased coal cost of goods sold and other charges increased due primarily to higher average cost per ton  offset  in part  by reduced volumes of purchased coal sold 
variance percentage change purchased tons sold in millions average cost of goods sold and other charges per ton the increase in cost of goods sold and other charges for purchased coal was primarily due to higher average cost per ton of purchased coal sold in compared to the increase in the average cost of purchased coal is primarily due to increased market prices for export and metallurgical coal 
the increase in cost of goods sold and other charges was offset  in part  due to a slight decrease in volume of purchased coal sold 
produced gas cost of goods sold and other charges increased due to increased average cost per thousand cubic feet sold and increased volumes 
variance percentage change produced gas gross sales volumes in billion cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet the increase in average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold was attributable to a increase per thousand cubic feet in royalty expense 
royalty expense increased primarily due to the increase in average sales price per thousand cubic feet in compared to average cost per thousand cubic feet of gas sold also increased approximately related to the purchase of firm transportation capacity on the columbia s interstate pipeline because of potential curtailments on portions of the shipment capacity allocated to consol energy as a result of increased demand for pipeline 
consol energy purchased firm transportation capacity on the pipeline from the may through october period to assure firm pipeline capacity of our projected production 
in november  consol energy entered into an extended firm transportation arrangement for use on the pipeline 
this arrangement covers november through october the purchased fixed capacity on the pipeline represents approximately of our projected production for the same period 
these increases were offset  in part  by various reduced costs in  none of which were individually material 
cost of goods sold and other charges for produced gas also increase due to increased sales volume in as a result of wells coming on line from the ongoing drilling program 
in addition  in order to satisfy obligations to certain customers  we purchased from and sold to other gas suppliers  which increased our revenues and our costs 
we believe this type of transaction will continue as a result of increased capacity demands on the columbia pipeline 
variance percentage change purchased gas sales volumes in billion cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet industrial supplies cost of goods sold increased due to higher sales volumes and higher unit costs of goods sold 
closed and idle mine costs were million in compared to million in the increase in cost reflects mine closing  perpetual care water treatment and reclamation liability adjustments as a result of updated engineering surveys 
survey adjustments resulted in million of expense in for closed and idled locations 
closed and idle mine cost also increased approximately million due to the change in calculation of workers compensation claims 
effective january   consol energy changed its method of accounting for workers compensation 
under the new method  the undiscounted liability is actuarially calculated based on 
table of contents claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
additionally  the workers compensation liability is recorded on a discounted basis  which has been actuarially determined using various assumptions 
approximately million of the increased closed and idle workers compensation increase is related to interest accretion 
the increase in closed and idle mine cost was offset by a decrease of million related to the idled rend lake mine 
rend lake mine has been idle since july closed and idle mine cost of goods sold and other charges was also impaired by approximately million due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which was individually material 
miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges decreased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change loveridge fire mine fire supply inventory write downs other post employee benefit curtailment gain cardinal river severance and pension cost buckeye landfill superfund site liability transfer litigation settlements and contingencies incentive compensation sales contract buy outs miscellaneous transactions total miscellaneous cost of goods sold and other charges in february  loveridge mine experienced a fire near the bottom of the slope entry that is used to carry coal from the mine to the surface 
the cost of goods sold and other charges related to extinguishing the fire was approximately million and other expenses related to the fire were approximately million  net of expected insurance recovery 
in late december  the mine had begun the process of developing a new underground area that would be mined with longwall mining equipment that was expected to be installed later in the fire delayed this installation until march of in january  mine experienced a fire along several hundred feet of the conveyor belt entry servicing the longwall section of the mine 
the fire was extinguished approximately two weeks later 
on january   the mine resumed production on a limited basis with continuous mining machines  while repairs continued on the belt entry 
the fire caused damage to the roof support system  the conveyor belt and the steel framework on which the belt travels 
repairs took several weeks to complete and were estimated to cost approximately million  net of expected insurance recovery  of which million was attributable to cost of goods sold and other related charges and million to other expenses 
longwall coal production  which accounts for the majority of coal normally produced at the mine resumed on february  supply inventory write downs reflect adjustments made in to supply inventories that are unique to the equipment used at dilworth and rend lake mines where the mining activities have ceased 
due to the restructuring that occurred in december  a curtailment gain related to the other post employment benefit plan of approximately million was recognized in due to consol energy s measurement date being september  the gain was not recognized until the quarter ended march  cardinal river mine severance and pension accruals are attributable to the costs for which consol energy remains responsible following the sale of the mine s assets 
accordingly  in  consol energy recognized the cost estimate of these plans 

table of contents in april  consol energy entered into an environmental liability transfer and indemnity agreement that transferred our liability related to the buckeye landfill superfund site to another party 
in consol energy was named a potentially responsible party related to the buckeye landfill superfund site and accordingly recognized our estimated liability for remediation of this site 
the transfer and indemnity transaction resulted in the reversal of the remaining liability and the recognition of approximately million of income 
litigation settlements and contingencies decreased due to various contingent loss accruals related to asbestos  waste management and various other contingencies in both periods  none of which are individually material 
incentive compensation expense increased in compared to due mainly to the level of earnings achieved in compared to projected annual results 
the incentive compensation package is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when consol energy reaches predetermined earnings targets and the employees reach predetermined performance targets 
there was no incentive compensation expense in due to consol energy not achieving predetermined earnings targets 
in  agreements were made with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher pricing 
cost of goods sold and other charges also decreased million due to various miscellaneous transactions which occurred throughout both periods  none of which was individually material 
freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc used for the customers to whom consol energy contractually provides transportation 
freight expense is billed to customers and the revenue from such billing equals the transportation expense 
dollar variance percentage change freight expense selling  general and administrative costs have decreased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change wages and salaries other post employment and pension costs professional consulting and other purchased services commissions insurance other total selling  general and administrative wages and salaries for selling  general and administrative have decreased primarily due to the december reduction in workforce program 
the reduction program was primarily focused on reducing the number of positions in the selling  general and administrative areas to better align with consol energy s current business strategy 
the program reduced approximately positions 
the decreases in expense as a result of these reductions were offset  in part  by the completion of the integrated information technology system provided by sap ag in august prior to the completion  wages and salaries for dedicated staff were capitalized as a component of the cost of the implementation project and are being amortized over seven years 
the wages capitalized for were approximately million 

table of contents costs related to other post employment benefits in have decreased from due to the recognition of the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of in professional consulting and other purchased services has decreased in primarily due to lower software support services  offset  in part  by professional and consulting services provided in relation to reviewing employee benefit plans and compensation packages provided by consol energy 
costs for coal commissions increased due to entering into an additional sales agreement in that requires commissions to be paid 
insurance costs increased primarily due to the cost of director and officer insurance costs incurred in for a portion of  consol energy directors and officers were previously insured under the rwe ag general liability policy 
depreciation  depletion and amortization has increased due to the following items dollar variance percentage change coal gas production gathering total gas other total depreciation  depletion and amortization the increase in coal depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily attributable to the acceleration of approximately million of depreciation for equipment and facilities at the rend lake and other idle mines 
consol energy s management reviewed the condition of the assets at these idle locations and determined no plan of use for these items  and therefore abandoned the facilities 
these facilities have existing coal reserves that may be accessed from other locations or through new facilities 
gas depreciation  depletion and amortization was consistent in both and production assets are depreciated using the units of production method 
units of production depreciation was based on higher gas volumes  offset by a lower rate due to increased reserve figures at january  compared to january  gathering assets are depreciated using the straight line method and their depreciation did not change in the period to period comparison 
the increase in other depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily due to additional depreciation on the integrated information technology system installed to support business processes 
the system was implemented in stages beginning in january and was substantially complete in august interest expense has decreased primarily due to the following items dollar variance percentage change revolving credit facility and commercial paper long term debt other total interest expense 
table of contents interest expense on commercial paper and the borrowings under the revolving credit facility increased primarily due to the weighted average interest rate of per annum in compared to in the increase was offset  in part  by a reduction of million in the weighted average amount of outstanding borrowings in compared to until july  consol energy s borrowings principally were in the form of commercial paper  which bears a lower interest rate than bank borrowings 
as of july  consol energy was no longer able to participate as a seller of commercial paper due to standard and poor s lowering its rating of our short term debt 
the decrease in long term debt interest expense also reflected the scheduled payment of million principal amount of debt in june other interest expense was reduced primarily due to the increase in the amount of interest capitalized in as a result of the higher level of capital projects funded from operating cash flows in taxes other than income has increased primarily due to the following items dollar variance percentage change production taxes coal gas total production taxes other taxes coal gas other total other taxes total taxes other than income increased coal production taxes are primarily due to higher severance and black lung excise taxes attributable to higher average sales prices and higher coal volumes produced in compared to increased gas production taxes are primarily due to higher severance taxes related to increased gas production volumes and higher average sales prices 
increased other taxes in the coal segment are primarily due to higher payroll taxes related to an increase in labor costs compared to the increased labor costs are primarily related to the late march start up of the loveridge mine 
this mine was idled in restructuring cost restructuring costs of approximately million in primarily represent the severance dollars paid related to the december reduction in workforce program implemented by consol energy 
the program was primarily focused on reducing the number of positions in the selling  general and administrative areas and resulted in the reduction of approximately positions and approximately million of wages  salaries and benefits in the administrative functions in also included in the restructuring costs are severance monies paid throughout for positions that have been eliminated by consol energy management in an effort to reduce costs and realign it s selling  general and administrative functions with today s company strategies 
export sales excise tax resolution consol energy is no longer required to pay certain excise taxes on export sales 
we have received refunds in for our claims and related interest for the years upon receipt of these items  we have 
table of contents adjusted our estimate of interest receivable to the amounts received 
this adjustment resulted in an additional million in a receivable for the claims for the years is still outstanding 
there is no interest receivable related to these claims 
income taxes variance percentage change earnings loss before income taxes tax expense benefit effective income tax rate consol energy s effective tax rate is sensitive to changes to the relationship between pre tax earnings and percentage depletion 
the effective rate for was also impacted by the recognition of the effects of the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the provision for income tax is adjusted at the time the returns are filed to reflect changes in previously estimated amounts 
the tax benefit was increased by million in and was reduced by million in related to these adjustments 
the income tax benefit also includes approximately million due to the release of a contingent income tax liability resulting from the settlement of the federal  state and foreign income tax audits of prior years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for additional information 
cumulative effect of changes in accounting for workers compensation  mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing costs effective january   consol energy changed our method of accounting for workers compensation 
prior to the change  consol energy recorded workers compensation liability on an undiscounted basis 
under the new method  consol energy recorded our workers compensation liability on a discounted actuarial basis using various assumptions including discount rate and future cost trends 
we believe the actuarial approach is more explicit in its methodology which should lead to better estimates of the liability and related periodic costs 
the change was preferable because it aligns the accounting for workers compensation with consol energy s other long term employee benefit obligations  which are recorded on a discounted basis 
additionally  it provides a better comparison with consol energy s industry peers  the majority of which  we believe  record the workers compensation liability on a discounted basis 
as a result of the change  consol energy reduced our workers compensation liability by million and reduced the related deferred tax asset by million 
the cumulative effect adjustment recognized upon adoption was a gain of million  and accordingly is reflected as a cumulative effect adjustment from a change in accounting 
effective january   consol energy adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  as required 
consol energy reflected a gain of approximately million  net of a tax cost of approximately million 
at the time of adoption  total assets  net of accumulated depreciation  increased approximately million and total liabilities increased approximately million 
the amounts recorded upon adoption were dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proved reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
previous accounting standards generally used the units of production method to match estimated retirement costs with the revenues generated by the producing assets 
in contrast  sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines 
because of the long lives of the underlying producing assets  the impact on net income in the near term is not expected to be material 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters 
management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
other post employment benefits consol energy has historically provided retiree health benefits to employees that retire with at least ten years of service and have attained age effective august   the eligibility requirement for salaried employees was changed to either twenty years of service and age  or fifteen years of service and age additionally  any salaried or non represented hourly employees that are hired or rehired effective august  or later will not become eligible for retiree health benefits 
in lieu of traditional retiree health coverage  if certain eligibility requirements are met  these employees may be eligible to receive a retiree medical spending allowance of  per year of service at retirement 
eligibility requirements for hourly employees have not changed from consol energy s historical requirements 
at december   a retiree health plan provided benefits to approximately  of our former employees and their eligible dependents 
in addition to the change in eligibility requirements  other changes have been made to the medical plan which covers eligible salaried employees and retirees 
these changes include a cost sharing structure where essentially all participants contribute of plan costs 
annual cost increases in excess of are paid entirely by the plan participants 
after our review  various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs  average remaining service period  average remaining life expectancy and per capita costs  are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans 
these assumptions have not differed materially from the prior year actual experience 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date currently september 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the other post employment benefit liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the year ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and medical cost inflation differing from expectations in prior years 
changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
the average remaining service period for our salaried plans is approximately years for the years ended december  and the average remaining life expectancy of our retired united mine workers of america population used to calculate the following year s expense is approximately years for the years ended december  and per capita costs on a per annum basis for other post retirement benefits were assumed to be  at december  this was approximately a increase over the per capita cost on a per annum basis at december  if the actual increase in per capita cost of medical services or other post retirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates  the per capita cost assumption would need to be 
table of contents adjusted annually  which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recognized in the financial statements 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements for december  and was billion 
for the year ended december   we paid approximately million for other post employment benefits  all of which were paid from operating cash flow 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  consol energy does not expect to contribute to the other post employment plan in we intend to pay benefit claims as they are due 
the following benefit payments which reflect expected future service  are expected to be paid year significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on consol energy s operating cash flow 
the effect on consol energy s cash flow from operations for salaried employees has been limited to approximately of the previous years medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision in the benefit plan 
on december   the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act was signed into law 
the act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare medicare part d as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d 
consol energy  as a sponsor of a retiree health care benefit plan that provides a prescription drug benefit actuarially equivalent to medicare part d  recognized the effects of the act in the year ended december  in accordance with financial accounting standards board staff position no 
fas  accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of implementation of the act resulted in a reduction of our postretirement benefit costs of million in the year ended december   and a reduction of million to our december  estimated other postretirement benefit obligation 
in the quarter ended december   consol energy notified all active and retired employees that current retiree medical plans required enrollment in medicare act part d 
we adopted a plan amendment to reflect that consol energy did not elect the federal subsidy provisions of the act 
instead  we will coordinate benefits with available medicare coverage 
medicare will be considered the primary payer  whether or not the beneficiary enrolled and paid the required premiums 
this plan amendment resulted in a million reduction of the accumulated projected benefit obligation and is part of actuarial gain and losses that will be amortized 
coal workers pneumoconiosis consol energy is responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease 
consol energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits 
after our review  our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and discount rates 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date currently september 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the coal workers pneumoconiosis liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of 
table of contents the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the year ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
in january  the united states department of labor amended the regulations implementing the federal black lung laws to give greater weight to the opinion of a claimant s treating physician  expand the definition of black lung disease and limit the amount of medical evidence that can be submitted by claimants and respondents 
the amendments also alter administrative procedures for the adjudication of claims  which according to the department of labor  results in streamlined procedures that are less formal  less adversarial and easier for participants to understand 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december  was approximately million compared to million at december  for the year ended december   we paid coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately million 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  salaried pensions consol energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multi employer retirement plans 
the benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employees compensation near retirement 
effective january   an amendment was made to the salaried pension plan 
as of this date  lump sum benefits have been frozen and prospectively the lump sum option has been eliminated 
also the amount of future benefit accruals has been reduced and early retirement subsidies have been eliminated 
our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation  mortality rates  retirement age and interest rates 
these assumptions have not differed materially from the prior year actual experience 
for the years ended december  and  compensation increases are assumed to range from to depending on age classification 
mortality assumptions were changed to reflect more recent information 
retirement rate assumptions were unchanged for the year ended december  retirement rate assumptions begin at for employees at age and increase to for employees at age the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date currently september 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the retirement plans could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the year ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased the net periodic pension cost by million 
deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and earnings on assets differing from expectations in prior years 
the average remaining service period is approximately years and years for the years ended december  and  respectively 
changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
the estimated liability at december  was million compared to million at december  due to the difference in the accumulated benefit obligation and the plan assets at december   approximately million was recognized as a minimum pension liability 
at december   the minimum pension liability was approximately million 
consol energy expects to contribute approximately million to the pension plan in the market related asset value is derived by taking the cost value of assets as of september  and multiplying it by the average month ratio of the market value of assets to the cost value of assets 
consol energy s pension plan weighted average asset allocations at september  consisted of equity securities and debt securities 
the consol energy salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions earned up until december  at the employees election 
as of january   lump sum benefits have been frozen and prospectively the lump sum option has been eliminated 
according to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  if the lump sum distributions made for the plan year  which is october to september  exceed the total of the 
table of contents service cost and interest cost for the plan year  settlement accounting is required 
consol regularly monitors this situation 
lump sum payments did not exceed this threshold during or if this were to occur  consol energy would need to recognize in the current year s results of operations  an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year 
generally  due to the lower interest rates currently being used to calculate lump sum distributions  the impact would be to recognize actuarial losses 
if this settlement accounting is triggered  the adjustment could materially impact operating results 
workers compensation workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation 
workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment 
consol energy changed our method of accounting for workers compensation effective january  under the new method  it records an actuarially calculated liability  which is determined using various assumptions  including discount rate and future cost trends 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date currently september 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the workers compensation liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  consol energy looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
for the year ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase or decrease in the discount rate would not have materially decreased or increased the workers compensation expense 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december   including the current portion  was approximately million 
consol energy s policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow 
no funding has been provided to cover these benefits 
for the year ended december   we made payments for workers compensation benefits of approximately million  all of which was paid from operating cash flow 
reclamation and mine closure obligations the surface mining control and reclamation act establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
consol energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine and gas well closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities  which are based upon permit requirements and consol energy engineering expertise related to these requirements  including the current portion  were approximately million at december  this liability is reviewed annually by consol energy management and engineers 
the estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves 
changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing liabilities 
the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 

table of contents sfas no 
requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines 
contingencies consol energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or cash flows 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
deferred taxes consol energy accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   consol energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
the deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
a deferred tax asset of approximately million relating to state net operating loss carry forwards has been offset with a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of these carry forwards 
however  consol energy is currently exploring several tax planning strategies that may allow a portion of the loss carry forwards to be recognized 
no other valuation allowance has been recognized because consol energy has determined that it is more likely than not that all of these deferred tax assets will be realized 
according to sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  must be considered to determine whether a valuation allowance is warranted 
for the year ended december  positive evidence considered included the level of sales and pricing currently being negotiated under fixed price contracts  the reversal of certain book to tax differences  particularly those related to minimum tax credits  and the ability to employ various tax planning strategies if necessary 
negative evidence included book and tax losses generated in past periods and the inability to achieve forecasted results in those past periods 
consol energy has concluded that the deferred tax assets  other than those associated with the state tax net operating losses  were more likely than not realizable 
management will continue to assess the realizability of deferred tax assets based upon continuing updates to future income forecasts and other tax planning strategies and may record adjustments in future periods as appropriate 
by our estimation  consol energy will begin paying regular tax and utilizing our deferred tax asset associated with the minimum tax in our judgment regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  our ability to successfully execute our business strategy  as well as other factors 
these changes  if any  may require a valuation allowance to be recorded that could materially impact net income 
successful efforts accounting we are required to select among alternative acceptable accounting policies 
there are two generally acceptable methods for accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
the full cost method allows the capitalization of all costs associated with exploring for  acquiring and developing oil and natural gas reserves 
the successful efforts method allows only for the capitalization of costs directly associated with exploring for  
table of contents acquiring and developing proven natural gas properties 
costs related to exploration that are not successful are expensed when it is determined that commercially productive gas reserves were not found 
we have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our gas producing activities 
coal and gas reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff 
the majority of our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts 
none of our coal reserves have been reviewed by independent experts 
some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
see risk factors in item a of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating our reserves 
liquidity and capital resources consol energy generally has satisfied its working capital requirements and funded our capital expenditures and debt service obligations from cash generated from operations and proceeds from borrowings 
on april   consol energy amended our credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity  reduce cost and extend the term 
the amended facility features a five year  million revolving credit facility  replacing the previous million credit facility  which included a tranche b credit linked deposit facility of million 
the amended facility is collateralized by liens on substantially all of the assets of consol energy and our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the gas business assets that were previously pledged as collateral security for the amended credit facility were released on august  in conjunction with the partial divestiture of cnx gas corporation  which was provided for within the amended facility 
collateral is shared equally and ratably with the holders of consol energy s bonds that mature in and consol energy s subsidiary s medium term notes maturing in fees and interest rate spreads are based on a ratio of financial covenant debt to twelve month trailing earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
covenants in the amended facility limit our ability to dispose of assets  make investments  purchase or redeem consol energy common stock and merge with another corporation 
the amended facility includes a leverage ratio covenant of not more than to  measured quarterly 
this ratio was to at december  the facility also includes an interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than to  measured quarterly 
this ratio was to at december  at december   this facility had approximately million letters of credit issued and had no outstanding borrowings  leaving approximately million of unused capacity 
on october   cnx gas  an controlled and consolidated subsidiary of consol energy  entered into a new credit agreement with a group of commercial lenders 
the new credit agreement provides for a 
table of contents revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to million  including borrowings and letters of credit 
cnx gas also has the ability to request an increase in aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to million  including borrowings and letters of credit 
this facility includes a leverage ratio covenant of not more than to  measured quarterly 
this ratio was to at december  the facility also includes an interest coverage ratio covenant of no less than to  measured quarterly 
this ratio was  to at december  at december   this facility had approximately million letters of credit issued and had no outstanding borrowings  leaving approximately million of unused capacity 
as a result of entering into the new credit agreement  cnx gas and their subsidiaries have executed a supplemental indenture and as of october  are again guarantors of consol energy s bonds 
consol energy and certain of our us subsidiaries also participate in a receivables securitization facility for the sale on a continuous basis of eligible trade accounts receivable that will provide  on a revolving basis  up to million of short term funding 
consol energy formed cnx funding corporation  a wholly owned  special purpose  bankruptcy remote subsidiary  for the sole purpose of buying and selling eligible trade receivables generated by certain subsidiaries of consol energy 
under the receivables facility  consol energy and certain subsidiaries  irrevocably and without recourse  sell all of their eligible trade accounts receivable to cnx funding corporation 
cnx funding corporation then sells  on a revolving basis  an undivided percentage interest in the pool of eligible trade accounts receivable to financial institutions and their affiliates  while maintaining a subordinated interest in a portion of the trade receivables 
consol energy has agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institutions for a fee based upon market rates for similar services 
the cost of funds is consistent with commercial paper rates plus a charge for administrative services paid to the financial institution 
the receivables facility expires in april we intend to renew this facility 
at december   there were no accounts receivable removed from the consolidated balance sheet related to this facility 
repayments of million were included as reduction to cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  consol energy believes that cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major acquisitions  scheduled debt payments  anticipated dividend payments and to provide required letters of credit 
nevertheless  the ability of consol energy to satisfy our working capital requirements  debt service obligations  to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal and gas industries and other financial and business factors  some of which are beyond consol energy s control 
in order to manage the market risk exposure of volatile natural gas prices in the future  consol energy enters into various physical gas supply transactions with both gas marketers and end users for terms varying in length 
consol energy has also entered into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges  which exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
the fair value of these contracts was a loss of million net of million of deferred tax at december  the ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of these contracts was insignificant to earnings in the year ended december  and consol energy frequently evaluates potential acquisitions 
consol energy has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations and a variety of other sources  depending on the size of the transaction  including debt financing 
there can be no assurance that additional capital resources  including debt financing  will be available to consol energy on terms which consol energy finds acceptable  or at all 

table of contents cash flows in millions change cash flows from operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows from operating activities have increased primarily due to the following items approximately million of insurance proceeds were collected in the year ended december  related to the buchanan mine fire 
operating cash flows improved million due to increases in earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting and excluding the gain on sale of interest in cnx gas  as previously discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operating cash flows were improved due to various changes in operating assets  operating liabilities  other assets and other liabilities which occurred throughout both periods 
operating cash flows were lower in the period compared to the period due to amounts paid related to the accounts receivable securitization program 
under the accounts receivable securitization facility  approximately million was repaid during the year ended december  compared to million received  net of payments from the facility in the year ended december  approximately million of insurance proceeds were collected in the year ended december  related to the loveridge mine fire 
net cash used in investing activities changed primarily due to the following items proceeds of million were received from the sale of interest in cnx gas 
in july  consol energy announced that we created cnx gas corporation cnx gas  a wholly owned subsidiary of consol energy  to conduct our gas exploration and production activities 
consol energy contributed substantially all of the assets of our gas business  including all of consol energy s rights to coalbed methane associated with billion tons of coal reserves owned or controlled by consol energy as well as all of consol energy s rights to conventional gas 
consol energy entered into various agreements with cnx gas that will define various operating and service relationships between the two companies 
in august  cnx gas  a subsidiary of consol energy  sold million shares in a private transaction 
the shares were sold to qualified institutional and accredited investors in a private transaction exempt from registration under rule a  regulation s and regulation d 
cnx gas received proceeds of million  which they used to pay a special dividend to consol energy 
capital expenditures were million in the period compared to million in the period 
capital expenditures were higher in due to the purchase of longwall mining equipment to replace existing equipment 
proceeds from the sale of assets were million in the period compared to million in the period 
proceeds in the period are related to the sale and subsequent lease back of the corporate office building and proceeds related to the sale of various properties held by consol energy throughout the period 
proceeds in the period were due to the sale of consol energy s stock in our wholly owned subsidiary cnx australia pty limited to certain affiliates of amci  inc and the sale of various properties held by consol energy throughout the period

these agreements require the construction by east tennessee  of an approximately mile lateral pipeline to our gas field in virginia from etng 
called jewel ridge  this proposed lateral pipeline currently is under permit review by the federal energy regulatory commission and is expected to be in service in the second half of in connection with the construction of the jewell ridge lateral  we will enter into a year firm transportation agreement with east tennessee at pre determined fixed rates 
we anticipate that the present value of our payments under this firm transportation agreement will be approximately million 
in addition to providing us with transportation flexibility  the jewell ridge lateral will provide access for our product to alternate and growing natural gas markets in the southeastern united states 
b long term liabilities include other post employment benefits  work related injuries and illnesses  defined benefit pension plans  mine reclamation and closure  and other long term liability costs 
as discussed in critical accounting policies and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  our determination of these long term liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular  for periods after our estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if our assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
capital expenditures were approximately million in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  we currently anticipate capital expenditures for the year ending december  to be approximately million  of which approximately million is to maintain current production levels 
however  we may choose to defer certain capital projects in light of operating results and the availability of financing 
capital expenditures for pollution abatement and reclamation are projected to be million for the year ending december  our capital expenditures have been and will be primarily used for replacement of mining and gas equipment  the expansion of mining and gas capacity and projects to improve the efficiency of the mining and gas operations

stockholders equity and dividends consol energy had stockholders equity of  million at december  and million at december  the increase is primarily attributable to net income for the year ended december  stockholders equity was reduced due to an increase of million in the year ended december  in other comprehensive losses 
these increases in other comprehensive losses were primarily due to various cash flow hedges related to our gas business 
comprehensive losses were reduced as a result of a decrease in minimum pension liabilities as a result of better performance of plan assets for non contributory defined benefit retirement plans than in the prior period 
comprehensive losses gains related to pension assets are generally calculated annually and reflect a number of factors including conditions in the stock markets and interest rates 
stockholders equity was also decreased in for the payment of dividends

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf on issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty 
the issue defines when a purchase and a sale of inventory with the same party that operates in the same line of business is recorded at fair value or considered a single nonmonetary transaction subject to the fair value exception of apb opinion no 
the purchase and sale transactions may be pursuant to a single contractual arrangement or separate contractual arrangements and the inventory purchased or sold may be in the form of raw materials  work in process  or finished goods 
in general  two or more transactions with the same party are treated as one if they are entered into in contemplation of each other 
the rules apply to new arrangements entered into in reporting periods beginning after march  the accounting for transactions that consol energy considers matching buy sell transactions will be affected by this consensus and therefore  upon adoption  these transactions will no longer be recorded on a gross basis 
consol energy is currently studying the provisions of this consensus to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements  however  management does not believe any impact on net income would be material 
there will be no impact on cash flows from operations as a result of adoption 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
this statement provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
this statement also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application of a change in accounting principle is impracticable and for reporting a change when retrospective application is impracticable 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retrospectively 
therefore  the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this statement 
this statement shall be effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on consol energy 
in june  the fasb ratified a modification to the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force in eitf accounting for stripping costs incurred during production in the mining industry 
the eitf clarified that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred 
the task force noted that the consensus does not address the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the pre production phase of a mine 
in addition  the consensus in this issue is effective for the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning after december  the effect of initially applying this consensus should be accounted for in a manner similar to a cumulative effect adjustment with any adjustment recognized in the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
we do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on consol energy 
in april  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas accounting for suspended well costs fsp 
this position concluded that exploratory well costs should continue to be capitalized beyond twelve months when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well  and the 
table of contents enterprise is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
this guidance requires management to exercise more judgment than was previously required and also requires additional disclosure 
we do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on consol energy 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies that the term  conditional asset retirement obligation  as used in fasb statement no 
 refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred  generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
sfas no 
acknowledges that  in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
we do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on consol energy 
on december   the fasb released its final revised standard entitled fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement requires that all public entities measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period  which usually is the vesting period 
compensation cost is not recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
in addition  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab on sfas no

the expected impact of unvested stock options outstanding at december   under the modified prospective application  is approximately  earnings before income taxes for the year ended december  management is currently evaluating the policy for determining our windfall tax benefits 
in november  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb  chapter fas 
this statement amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
paragraph of arb  chapter  previously stated that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excess spoilage  double freight  and re handling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
fas requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  
table of contents this statement requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  disclosure of the impact that recently issued accounting standards will have on the financial statements of the registrant when adopted in a future period sab  we have evaluated the provisions of fas to determine the presently known material changes  trends and uncertainties that are reasonably expected to have an impact on future financial disclosures 
consol does not expect the changes in accordance with the provisions of fas to have a material impact on the financial position and results of operations in future periods 
the provisions of this statement are effective for inventory cost incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  on october   the fasb ratified eitf issue no

 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information  in determining whether to aggregate operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds eitf 
fasb statement no 
requires that a public business enterprise report financial and descriptive information about its reportable operating segments 
operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
eitf clarifies how an enterprise should evaluate the aggregation criteria in paragraph of fas when determining whether operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds may be aggregated in accordance with paragraph of fas in addition  the fasb task force has requested that the fasb staff propose a fasb staff position fsp to provide guidance in determining whether two or more operating segments have similar economic characteristics 
the tax force has agreed that since the two issues are interrelated  the effective date of eitf should coincide with the future undetermined effective date of the anticipated fsp 
we are currently evaluating the positions addressed in eitf  and foresee no significant changes in the reporting practices currently used to report segment information 
in october  the american jobs creation act of was signed into law 
consol energy has implemented the qualified production activities deduction as enacted by the american jobs creation act of the deduction is currently equal to of qualified production activities income as limited by taxable income and as limited by percent of the employer s w wages for the tax year 
the percentage used in computing the deduction will be in  in through and in and after 
as a special deduction in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  it is included as a permanent benefit in consol energy s estimate of its annual effective tax rate 
the act also provided for a temporary dividends received deduction as an incentive to repatriate accumulated foreign earnings and profits 
consol energy opted to leave accumulated earnings and profits as permanently reinvested outside the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in operations  consol energy is exposed to financial  market  political and economic risks 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding consol energy s exposure to the risks of changing natural gas prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
consol energy is exposed to market price risk in the normal course of selling natural gas production and to a lesser extent in the sale of coal 
consol sells coal under both short term and long term contracts with fixed price and or indexed price contracts that reflect market value 
consol energy uses fixed price contracts and derivative commodity instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
to minimize exposure to market price volatility in the sale of natural gas 
our risk management policy strictly prohibits the use of derivatives for speculative positions 
consol energy has established risk management policies and procedures to strengthen the internal control environment of the marketing of commodities produced from our asset base 
all of the derivative instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
they are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and cover underlying exposures 
consol energy s market risk strategy incorporates fundamental risk management tools to assess market price risk and establish a framework in which management can maintain a portfolio of transactions within pre defined risk parameters 

table of contents consol energy believes that the use of derivative instruments along with the risk assessment procedures and internal controls does not expose consol energy to material risk 
the use of derivative instruments could materially affect consol energy s results of operations depending on market prices 
however  we believe that use of these instruments will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity 
for a summary of accounting policies related to derivative instruments  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
sensitivity analyses of the incremental effects on pre tax earnings for the year ended december  of a hypothetical and change in natural gas prices for open derivative instruments as of december  are provided in the following table incremental decrease in pre tax earnings assuming a hypothetical price  exchange rate or interest rate change of in millions natural gas consol energy remains at risk for possible changes in the market value of these derivative instruments  however  such risk should be mitigated by price changes in the underlying hedged item 
the effect of this offset is not reflected in the sensitivity analyses 
consol energy entered into derivative instruments to convert the market prices related to portions of the through anticipated sales of natural gas to fixed prices 
the sensitivity analysis reflects an inverse relationship between increases in commodity prices and a benefit to earnings 
when commodity prices increase  pretax income decreases 
the fair value of these contracts was a net loss of million net of million deferred tax 
we continually evaluate the portfolio of derivative commodity instruments and adjust the strategy to anticipated market conditions and risks accordingly 
consol energy is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
the credit worthiness of counterparties is subject to continuing review 
consol energy s interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states 
at december   consol energy had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of debt under fixed rate instruments and million aggregate principal amount of debt under variable rate instruments 
consol energy s primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our revolving credit facility  under which there was no borrowings outstanding at december  due to the level of borrowings against this facility in the year ended december   a basis point increase in the average rate for consol energy s revolving credit facility would not have significantly decreased net income for the period 
the fair value of consol energy s financial instruments is set forth in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
almost all of consol energy s transactions are denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks
