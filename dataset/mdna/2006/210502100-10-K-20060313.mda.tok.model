item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere in this report 
overview consumer portfolio services  inc cps  and together with its subsidiaries  the company is a consumer finance company which specializes in purchasing  selling and servicing retail automobile installment purchase contracts contracts originated by licensed motor vehicle dealers dealers in the sale of new and used automobiles  light trucks and passenger vans 
through its purchases  the company provides indirect financing to dealer customers for borrowers with limited credit histories  low incomes or past credit problems sub prime customers 
the company serves as an alternative source of financing for dealers  allowing sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing 
the company does not lend money directly to consumers 
rather  it purchases installment contracts from dealers based on its financing programs the cps programs 
on march   the company acquired mfn financial corporation and its subsidiaries in a merger the mfn merger 
on may   the company acquired tfc enterprises  inc and its subsidiaries in a second merger the tfc merger 
each merger was accounted for as a purchase 
mfn financial corporation and its subsidiaries mfn and tfc enterprises  inc and its subsidiaries tfc were engaged in businesses similar to that of the company buying contracts from dealers  financing those contracts through securitization transactions  and servicing those contracts 
mfn ceased acquiring contracts in may  tfc continues to acquire contracts under its tfc programs  which provide financing for vehicle purchases exclusively by members of the united states armed forces 
on april   the company purchased in the seawest asset acquisition a portfolio of contracts and certain other assets from seawest financial corporation and its subsidiaries collectively  seawest 
in addition  the company was named the successor servicer of three term securitization transactions originally sponsored by seawest the seawest third party portfolio 
the company does not intend to offer financing programs similar to those previously offered by seawest 
from inception through june  the company generated revenue primarily from the gains recognized on the sale or securitization of contracts  servicing fees earned on contracts sold  interest earned on residuals  as defined below  and interest on finance receivables 
since july  the company has not recognized any gains from the sale of contracts 
instead  since july its revenues have been derived from servicing fees and interest earned on residuals for contracts sold prior to july and interest on finance receivables for contracts purchased since july 
securitization generally throughout the periods for which information is presented in this report  the company has purchased contracts with the intention of repackaging them in securitizations 
all such securitizations have involved identification of specific contracts  sale of those contracts and associated rights to a special purpose subsidiary of the company  and issuance of asset backed securities to fund the transactions 
depending on the structure of the securitization  the transaction may properly be accounted for as a sale of the contracts  or as a secured financing 
when structured to be treated as a secured financing  the subsidiary is consolidated with the company 
accordingly  the sold contracts and the related securitization trust debt appear as assets and liabilities  respectively  of the company on its consolidated balance sheet 
the company then periodically i recognizes interest and fee income on the receivables ii recognizes interest expense on the securities issued in the securitization and iii records as expense a provision for credit losses on the receivables 
when structured to be treated as a sale  the subsidiary is not consolidated with the company 
accordingly  the securitization removes the sold contracts from the company s consolidated balance sheet  the asset backed securities debt of the non consolidated subsidiary do not appear as debt of the company  and the company shows  as an asset  a retained residual interest in the sold contracts 
the residual interest represents the discounted value of what the company expects will be the excess of future collections on the contracts over principal and interest due on the asset backed securities 
that residual interest appears on the company s consolidated balance sheet as residual interest in securitizations  and the determination of its value is dependent on estimates of the future performance of the sold contracts 
change in policy beginning in the third quarter of  the company began to structure its term securitization transactions so that they would be treated for financial accounting purposes as borrowings secured by receivables  rather than as sales of receivables 
all subsequent term securitizations of such finance receivables have been so structured 
prior to august  the company had structured its term securitization transactions related to the cps programs to be treated as sales for financial accounting purposes 
in the mfn merger and in the tfc merger the company acquired finance receivables that had been previously securitized in term securitization transactions that were reflected as secured financings 
as of december   the company s consolidated balance sheet included net finance receivables of approximately million and securitization trust debt of million related to finance receivables acquired in the two mergers  out of totals of net finance receivables of approximately million and securitization trust debt of approximately million 
credit risk retained whether a securitization is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes  the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to the company if the credit performance of the securitized contracts falls short of pre determined standards 
such releases represent a material portion of the cash that the company uses to fund its operations 
an unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both the company s liquidity and its results of operations  regardless of whether such contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed 
for estimation of the magnitude of such risk  it may be appropriate to look to the size of the company s managed portfolio  which represents both financed and sold contracts as to which such credit risk is retained 
the company s managed portfolio as of december  was approximately billion this amount includes million related to the seawest third party portfolio on which the company earns only servicing fees and has no credit risk 
critical accounting policies the company believes that its accounting policies related to a allowance for finance credit losses  b residual interest in securitizations and gain on sale of contracts and c income taxes are considered to be the most critical to understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results 
such policies are described below 
a allowance for finance credit losses in order to estimate an appropriate allowance for losses to be incurred on finance receivables  the company uses a loss allowance methodology commonly referred to as static pooling  which stratifies its finance receivable portfolio into separately identified pools 
using analytical and formula driven techniques  the company estimates an allowance for finance credit losses  which management believes is adequate for probable credit losses that can be reasonably estimated in its portfolio of finance receivable contracts 
provision for loss is charged to the company s consolidated statement of operations 
net losses incurred on finance receivables are charged to the allowance 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance by examining current delinquencies  the characteristics of the portfolio and the value of the underlying collateral 
as conditions change  the company s level of provisioning and or allowance may change as well 
b residual interest in securitizations and gain on sale of contracts gain on sale was recognized on the disposition of contracts either outright or in securitization transactions 
in those securitization transactions that were treated as sales for financial accounting purposes  the company  or a wholly owned  consolidated subsidiary of the company  retains a residual interest in the contracts that were sold to a wholly owned  unconsolidated special purpose subsidiary 
the company s securitization transactions include term securitizations the purchaser holds the contracts for substantially their entire term and continuous or warehouse securitizations which finance the acquisition of the contracts for future sale into term securitizations 
the line item residual interest in securitizations on the company s consolidated balance sheet represents the residual interests in term securitizations completed prior to july this line represents the discounted sum of expected future cash flows from these securitization trusts 
accordingly  the valuation of the residual is heavily dependent on estimates of future performance of the contracts included in the term securitizations 
all subsequent securitizations were structured as secured financings 
the warehouse securitizations are accordingly reflected in the line items finance receivables and warehouse lines of credit on the company s consolidated balance sheet  and the term securitizations are reflected in the line items finance receivables and securitization trust debt 
the key economic assumptions used in measuring all residual interests in securitizations as of december  and are included in the table below 
the company has used an effective pre tax discount rate of per annum except for certain collections from charged off receivables related to the company s securitizations in and later  where the company has used a discount rate of per annum 
prepayment speed cumulative net credit losses cumulative key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate and adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows december  dollars in thousands carrying amount fair value of residual interest in securitizations  weighted average life in years prepayment speed assumption cumulative estimated fair value assuming adverse change  estimated fair value assuming adverse change  expected net credit losses cumulative estimated fair value assuming adverse change  estimated fair value assuming adverse change  residual cash flows discount rate annual estimated fair value assuming adverse change  estimated fair value assuming adverse change  these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on and percent variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in this table  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption  in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  increases in market rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses  which could magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
the company s securitization structure has generally been as follows the company sells contracts it acquires to a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary sps  which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the company s contracts 
the sps then transfers the same contracts to another entity  typically a statutory trust trust 
the trust issues interest bearing asset backed securities notes  in a principal amount equal to or less than the aggregate principal balance of the contracts 
the company typically sells these contracts to the trust at face value and without recourse  except that representations and warranties similar to those provided by the dealer to the company are provided by the company to the trust 
one or more investors purchase the notes issued by the trust  the proceeds from the sale of the notes are then used to purchase the contracts from the company 
the company may retain or sell subordinated notes issued by the trust or by a related entity 
the company purchases a financial guaranty insurance policy  guaranteeing timely payment of principal and interest on the senior notes  from an insurance company a note insurer 
in addition  the company provides credit enhancement for the benefit of the note insurer and the investors in the form of an initial cash deposit to a bank account spread account held by the trust  in the form of overcollateralization of the notes  where the principal balance of the notes issued is less than the principal balance of the contracts  in the form of subordinated notes  or some combination of such credit enhancements 
the agreements governing the securitization transactions collectively referred to as the securitization agreements require that the initial level of credit enhancement be supplemented by a portion of collections from the contracts until the level of credit enhancement reaches specified levels which are then maintained 
the specified levels are generally computed as a percentage of the principal amount remaining unpaid under the related contracts 
the specified levels at which the credit enhancement is to be maintained will vary depending on the performance of the portfolios of contracts held by the trusts and on other conditions  and may also be varied by agreement among the company  the sps  the note insurers and the trustee 
such levels have increased and decreased from time to time based on performance of the various portfolios  and have also varied by securitization agreement 
the securitization agreements generally grant the company the option to repurchase the sold contracts from the trust when the aggregate outstanding balance of the contracts has amortized to a specified percentage of the initial aggregate balance 
the prior securitizations that were treated as sales for financial accounting purposes differ from secured financings in that the trust to which the sps sold the contracts met the definition of a qualified special purpose entity under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
as a result  assets and liabilities of the trust are not consolidated into the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company s warehouse securitization structures were similar to the above  except that i the sps that purchases the contracts pledges the contracts to secure promissory notes which it issues  ii the promissory notes are in an aggregate principal amount of not more than of the aggregate principal balance of the contracts that is  at least overcollateralization  and iii no increase in the required amount of credit enhancement is contemplated unless certain portfolio performance tests are breached 
during the quarter ended september  the warehouse securitizations related to the cps programs were amended to cause the transactions to be treated as secured financings for financial accounting purposes 
the contracts held by the warehouse spss and the promissory notes that they issue are therefore included in the company s consolidated financial statements as of december  and as assets and liabilities  respectively 
upon each sale of contracts in a securitization structured as a secured financing  whether a term securitization or a warehouse securitization  the company retains on its consolidated balance sheet the contracts securitized as assets and records the notes issued in the transaction as indebtedness of the company 
under the prior securitizations structured as sales for financial accounting purposes  the company removed from its consolidated balance sheet the contracts sold and added to its consolidated balance sheet i the cash received  if any  and ii the estimated fair value of the ownership interest that the company retains in contracts sold in the securitization 
that retained or residual interest the residual consists of a the cash held in the spread account  if any  b overcollateralization  if any  c subordinated notes retained  if any  and d receivables from trust  which include the net interest receivables nirs 
nirs represent the estimated discounted cash flows to be received from the trust in the future  net of principal and interest payable with respect to the notes  and certain expenses 
the excess of the cash received and the assets retained by the company over the carrying value of the contracts sold  less transaction costs  equals the net gain on sale of contracts recorded by the company 
until the maturity of these transactions  the company s consolidated balance sheet will reflect both securitization transactions structured as sales and others structured as secured financings 
with respect to securitizations structured as sales for financial accounting purposes  the company allocates its basis in the contracts between the notes sold and the residuals retained based on the relative fair values of those portions on the date of the sale 
the company recognizes gains or losses attributable to the change in the fair value of the residuals  which are recorded at estimated fair value 
the company is not aware of an active market for the purchase or sale of interests such as the residuals  accordingly  the company determines the estimated fair value of the residuals by discounting the amount of anticipated cash flows that it estimates will be released to the company in the future the cash out method  using a discount rate that the company believes is appropriate for the risks involved 
the anticipated cash flows include collections from both current and charged off receivables 
the company has used an effective pre tax discount rate of per annum except for certain collections from charged off receivables related to the company s securitizations in and later where the company has used a discount rate of per annum 
the company receives periodic base servicing fees for the servicing and collection of the contracts 
in addition  the company is entitled to the cash flows from the trusts that represent collections on the contracts in excess of the amounts required to pay principal and interest on the notes  the base servicing fees  and certain other fees such as trustee and custodial fees 
required principal payments on the notes are generally defined as the payments sufficient to keep the principal balance of the notes equal to the aggregate principal balance of the related contracts excluding those contracts that have been charged off  or a pre determined percentage of such balance 
where that percentage is less than  the related securitization agreements require accelerated payment of principal until the principal balance of the notes is reduced to the specified percentage 
such accelerated principal payment is said to create overcollateralization of the notes 
if the amount of cash required for payment of fees  interest and principal exceeds the amount collected during the collection period  the shortfall is withdrawn from the spread account  if any 
if the cash collected during the period exceeds the amount necessary for the above allocations  and there is no shortfall in the related spread account or other form of credit enhancement  the excess is released to the company  or in certain cases is transferred to other spread accounts related to transactions insured by the same note insurer that may be below their required levels 
if the total credit enhancement amount is not at the required level  then the excess cash collected is retained in the trust until the specified level is achieved 
although spread account balances are held by the trusts on behalf of the company s sps as the owner of the residuals in the case of securitization transactions structured as sales for financial accounting purposes or the trusts in the case of securitization transactions structured as secured financings for financial accounting purposes  the cash in the spread accounts is restricted from use by the company 
cash held in the various spread accounts is invested in high quality  liquid investment securities  as specified in the securitization agreements 
the interest rate payable on the contracts is significantly greater than the interest rate on the notes 
as a result  the residuals described above are a significant asset of the company 
in determining the value of the residuals  the company must estimate the future rates of prepayments  delinquencies  defaults  default loss severity  and recovery rates  as all of these factors affect the amount and timing of the estimated cash flows 
the company estimates prepayments by evaluating historical prepayment performance of comparable contracts 
as of december   the company used prepayment estimates of approximately to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts 
the company estimates defaults and default loss severity using available historical loss data for comparable contracts and the specific characteristics of the contracts purchased by the company 
the company estimates recovery rates of previously charged off receivables using available historical recovery data 
in valuing the residuals as of december   the company estimates that charge offs as a percentage of the original principal balance will approximate to cumulatively over the lives of the related contracts  with recovery rates approximating to of the original principal balance 
following a securitization that is structured as a sale for financial accounting purposes  interest income is recognized on the balance of the residuals 
in addition  the company will recognize as a gain additional revenue from the residuals if the actual performance of the contracts is better than the company s estimate of the value of the residual 
if the actual performance of the contracts were worse than the company s estimate  then a downward adjustment to the carrying value of the residuals and a related impairment charge would be required 
in a securitization structured as a secured financing for financial accounting purposes  interest income is recognized when accrued under the terms of the related contracts and  therefore  presents less potential for fluctuations in performance when compared to the approach used in a transaction structured as a sale for financial accounting purposes 
in all the company s term securitizations  whether treated as secured financings or as sales  the company has sold the receivables through a subsidiary to the securitization trust 
the difference between the two structures is that in securitizations that are treated as secured financings the company reports the assets and liabilities of the securitization trust on its consolidated balance sheet 
under both structures the noteholders and the related securitization trusts recourse to the company for failure of the contract obligors to make payments on a timely basis is limited to the company s finance receivables  spread accounts and residuals 
c income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and combined or stand alone state franchise tax returns for certain states 
the company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company has estimated a valuation allowance against that portion of the deferred tax asset whose utilization in future periods is not more than likely 
in determining the possible realization of deferred tax assets  future taxable income from the following sources are considered a the reversal of taxable temporary differences  b future operations exclusive of reversing temporary differences  and c tax planning strategies that  if necessary  would be implemented to accelerate taxable income into periods in which net operating losses might otherwise expire 
see liquidity and capital resources and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations effects of change in securitization structure the company s decision in the third quarter of to structure securitization transactions as borrowings secured by receivables for financial accounting purposes  rather than as sales of receivables  has affected and will affect the way in which the transactions are reported 
the major effects are these i the finance receivables are shown as assets of the company on its balance sheet  ii the debt issued in the transactions is shown as indebtedness of the company  iii cash deposited to enhance the credit of the securitization transactions spread accounts is shown as restricted cash on the company s balance sheet  iv cash collected from borrowers and other sources related to the receivables prior to making the required payments under the securitization agreements is also shown as restricted cash on the company s balance sheet  v the servicing fee that the company receives in connection with such receivables is recorded as a portion of the interest earned on such receivables in the company s statements of operations  vi the company has initially and periodically recorded as expense a provision for estimated credit losses on the receivables in the company s statements of operations  and vii of scheduled payments on the receivables and on the debt issued in the transactions  the portion representing interest is recorded as interest income and expense  respectively  in the company s statements of operations 
these changes collectively represent a deferral of revenue and acceleration of expenses  and thus a more conservative approach to accounting for the company s operations compared to the previous term securitization transactions  which were accounted for as sales at the consummation of the transaction 
the changes have resulted in the company s initially reporting lower earnings than it would have reported if it had continued to structure its securitizations to require recognition of gain on sale 
it should also be noted that growth in the company s portfolio of receivables would result in an increase in expenses in the form of provision for credit losses  and would initially have a negative effect on net earnings 
the company s cash availability and cash requirements should be unaffected by the change in structure 
since july  the company has conducted term securitizations of contracts originated under the cps programs structured as secured financings  generally on a quarterly basis 
in march and november  the company completed securitizations of its retained interests in other securitizations previously sponsored by the company and its affiliates 
the debt from the march transaction was repaid in august in june  the company completed a term securitization of contracts purchased in the seawest asset acquisition and under the tfc programs 
in december  the company completed a securitization that included contracts purchased under the tfc programs  the cps programs and contracts re acquired by the company as a result of clean ups of prior securitizations of its mfn and tfc subsidiaries 
since july  all of the company s securitizations have been structured as secured financings 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
during the year ended december   revenues were million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year revenue of million 
the primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million in from million in the primary reason for the increase in interest income is the growth of the finance receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries on the company s balance sheet 
during  the company purchased million of contracts and increased its balance of receivables held by consolidated subsidiaries to billion at december  from million at december   an increase of 
offsetting the increase in interest income were decreases in the balance of receivables from the seawest acquisitions and the tfc and mfn subsidiaries  which resulted in decreases in interest income of million  million and million  respectively 
servicing fees totaling million in the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million in the same period a year earlier 
the decrease in servicing fees is the result of the change in securitization structure and the consequent decline in the company s managed portfolio held by non consolidated subsidiaries  and the decrease in the seawest third party portfolio 
as a result of the decision to structure future securitizations as secured financings  the company s managed portfolio held by non consolidated subsidiaries will continue to decline in future periods  and servicing fee revenue is anticipated to decline proportionately 
as of december  and  the company s managed portfolio owned by consolidated vs 
non consolidated subsidiaries and other third parties was as follows december  december  amount amount total managed portfolio dollars in millions owned by consolidated subsidiaries  owned by non consolidated subdiaries seawest third party portfolio total  at december   the company was generating income and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating billion this amount includes million related to the seawest third party portfolio on which the company earns only servicing fees  compared to a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating million as of december  as the portfolios of contracts acquired in the mfn merger and the tfc merger decrease  the portfolio of contracts originated under the cps programs continues to expand

expenses 
the company s operating expenses consist primarily of employee costs and other operating expenses  which are incurred as applications and contracts are received  processed and serviced 
factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments  and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and the unemployment level 
employee costs include base salaries  commissions and bonuses paid to employees  and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options  and are one of the company s most significant operating expenses 
these costs other than those relating to stock options generally fluctuate with the level of applications and contracts processed and serviced 
other operating expenses consist primarily of interest expense  provisions for credit losses  facilities expenses  telephone and other communication services  credit services  computer services including employee costs associated with information technology support  professional services  marketing and advertising expenses  and depreciation and amortization 
total operating expenses were million for  compared to million for the increase is primarily due to a million increase  or in the provision for credit losses to million during the period as compared to million in the period 
interest expense increased by million to million from million in  an increase of 
the increase is primarily the result of the amount of securitization trust debt carried on the company s consolidated balance sheet which increased along with the growth of the company s portfolio of finance receivables 
the increase was somewhat offset by the decrease in securitization trust debt acquired in the mfn merger and the tfc merger 
for  the provision for credit losses and interest expense represented and  respectively  of total operating expenses  compared to and in employee costs increased to million  or during  representing of total operating expenses  from million for  or of total operating expenses 
the decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher total of operating expenses  primarily a result of the increased provision for credit losses and interest expense 
general and administrative expenses increased slightly to million  or of total operating expenses  in  as compared to million  or of total operating expenses  in the decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher operating expenses primarily a result of the increased provision for credit losses and interest expense 
during the year ended december   the company recognized what management believes will be a one time  non cash impairment charge of million against certain non finance receivables related assets 
in december  the compensation committee of the board of directors approved accelerated vesting of all the outstanding stock options issued by the company 
options to purchase  shares of the company s common stock  which would otherwise have vested from time to time through  became immediately exercisable as a result of the acceleration of vesting 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of the options was made primarily to reduce non cash compensation expenses that would have been recorded in the company s income statement in future periods upon the adoption of financial accounting standards board statement no 
r in january the company estimates that approximately million of future non cash compensation expense will be eliminated as a result of the acceleration of vesting 
at the time of the acceleration of vesting  the company accounted for its stock options in accordance with accounting principals board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
consequently  the acceleration of vesting resulted in non cash compensation charge of  for the year ended december  for  the company recognized no impairment loss on its residual interest in securitizations compared to million in in  such impairment loss related to the company s analysis and estimate of the expected ultimate performance of the company s previously securitized pools that are held by non consolidated subsidiaries and the residual interest in securitizations 
the impairment loss was a result of the actual net loss and prepayment rates exceeding the company s previous estimates for the contracts held by non consolidated subsidiaries 
marketing expenses increased by million  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the increase is primarily due to the increase in contracts purchased by the company during the year ended december  occupancy expenses decreased by  or  and represented of total operating expenses 
the decrease is primarily due to the closure and sub leasing during of certain facilities acquired in the mfn merger and the tfc merger 
depreciation and amortization expenses remained essentially unchanged at  for and represented of total operating expenses 
the company would have recorded income tax expense of million for the year ended december   but the income tax expense was offset primarily by a million decrease in the valuation allowance that has been established to offset the company s deferred tax assets 
the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues 
during the year ended december   revenues were million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year revenue of million 
the primary reason for the increase in revenues is an increase in interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million in from million in the primary reasons for the increase in interest income are the change in securitization structure implemented during the third quarter of as described above an increase of million and the interest income earned on the portfolios of contracts acquired in the tfc merger an increase of million and the seawest asset acquisition an increase of million 
this increase was partially offset by the decline in the balance of the portfolio of contracts acquired in the mfn merger resulting in a decrease of million in interest income and a decrease in residual interest income a decrease of million 
the increase in interest income is offset in part by the elimination of net gain on sale of contracts revenue and a decrease in servicing fees 
as a result of the change in securitization structure  zero net gain on sale of contracts was recorded in  compared to million net gain on sale in the year earlier period 
servicing fees totaling million in the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million in the same period a year earlier 
the decrease in servicing fees is the result of the change in securitization structure and the consequent decline in the company s managed portfolio held by non consolidated subsidiaries 
the decrease was partially offset by the servicing fees earned on the seawest third party portfolio  which totaled million 
as a result of the decision to structure future securitizations as secured financings  the company s managed portfolio held by non consolidated subsidiaries will continue to decline in future periods  and servicing fee revenue is anticipated to decline proportionately 
as of december  and  the company s managed portfolio owned by consolidated vs 
non consolidated subsidiaries and other third parties was as follows december  december  amount amount total managed portfolio dollars in millions owned by consolidated subsidiaries owned by non consolidated subsidiaries seawest third party portfolio total at december   the company was generating income and fees on a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating million this amount includes million related to the seawest third party portfolio on which the company earns only servicing fees  compared to a managed portfolio with an outstanding principal balance approximating million as of december  as the portfolios of contracts acquired in the mfn merger and the tfc merger decrease  the portfolio of contracts originated under the cps programs continues to expand 
at december  and  the managed portfolio composition was as follows december  december  amount amount originating entity dollars in millions cps tfc mfn seawest seawest third party portfolio total other income decreased million  or  to million during from million during the period over period decrease resulted primarily from a sales tax refund of received in and decreased recoveries on previously charged off mfn contracts  which were million during  compared to million for expenses 
the company s operating expenses consist primarily of employee costs and other operating expenses  which are incurred as applications and contracts are received  processed and serviced 
factors that affect margins and net income include changes in the automobile and automobile finance market environments  and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and the unemployment level 
employee costs include base salaries  commissions and bonuses paid to employees  and certain expenses related to the accounting treatment of outstanding warrants and stock options  and are one of the company s most significant operating expenses

total operating expenses were million for  compared to million for the increase is primarily due to a million increase in the provision for credit losses to million during the period as compared to million in the period 
increased interest expense was also significant 
employee costs increased to million during  representing of total operating expenses  from million for  or of total operating expenses 
the slight increase is primarily the result of staff additions related to increased contract purchases in an increase of million 
this increase was partially offset by staff reductions since the mfn merger in related to the integration and consolidation of certain service and administrative activities and the decline in the balance of the portfolio of contracts acquired in the mfn merger a decrease of million 
the decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher total of operating expenses  primarily a result of the increased provision for credit losses and interest expense 
general and administrative expenses remained essentially unchanged at million  or of total operating expenses  in  as compared to million  or of total operating expenses  in the decrease as a percentage of total operating expenses reflects the higher operating expenses primarily a result of the provision for credit losses and interest expense 
interest expense for increased million  or  to million  compared to million in the increase is primarily the result of changes in the amount and composition of securitization trust debt carried on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
such debt increased as a result of the change in securitization structure implemented beginning in july  the tfc merger in may and the seawest asset acquisition in april a combined increase of approximately million  partially offset by the decrease in the balance of the securitization trust debt acquired in the mfn merger resulting in a decrease of approximately million in interest expense 
impairment loss increased by million  or  to million in as compared to million in such impairment loss relates to the company s analysis and estimate of the expected ultimate performance of the company s previously securitized pools that are held by non consolidated subsidiaries and the residual interest in securitizations

the benefit is primarily the result of the resolution of certain internal revenue service examinations of previously filed mfn tax returns  resulting in a tax benefit of million  and other state tax matters resulting in a tax provision of million 
the company does not expect any comparable income tax benefit in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity the company s business requires substantial cash to support its purchases of contracts and other operating activities 
the company s primary sources of cash have been cash flows from operating activities  including proceeds from sales of contracts  amounts borrowed under various revolving credit facilities also sometimes known as warehouse credit facilities  servicing fees on portfolios of contracts previously sold in securitization transactions or serviced for third parties  customer payments of principal and interest on finance receivables  fees for origination of contracts  and releases of cash from securitized portfolios of contracts in which the company has retained a residual ownership interest and from the spread accounts associated with such pools 
the company s primary uses of cash have been the purchases of contracts  repayment of amounts borrowed under lines of credit and otherwise  operating expenses such as employee  interest  occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses  the establishment of spread accounts and initial overcollateralization  if any  and the increase of credit enhancement to required levels in securitization transactions  and income taxes 
there can be no assurance that internally generated cash will be sufficient to meet the company s cash demands 
the sufficiency of internally generated cash will depend on the performance of securitized pools which determines the level of releases from those portfolios and their related spread accounts  the rate of expansion or contraction in the company s managed portfolio  and the terms upon which the company is able to acquire  sell  and borrow against contracts 
net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
cash from operating activities is generally provided by the net releases from the company s securitization trusts 
the increase in vs 
is due in part to the company s increased net earnings before the significant increase in the provision for credit losses 
the decrease in vs 
is primarily the result of the company s decision  in july  to treat all of its future securitizations as secured financings 
as a result  and include no activity related to contracts held for sale 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities has generally related to purchases of contracts  the cost of the seawest asset acquisition and the acquisition of tfc 
purchase of finance receivables held for investment were  and in  and  respectively 
cash used in the tfc merger  net of the cash acquired in the transaction  totaled million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   was million compared with million in and million for the year ended december  cash used or provided by financing activities is primarily attributable to the issuance or repayment of debt 
in connection with the tfc merger the company assumed securitization trust debt related to three securitization transactions held by consolidated subsidiaries and assumed additional subordinated debt 
with the change in the securitization structure implemented in the third quarter of  million of securitization trust debt was issued in as compared to million in and million in contracts are purchased from dealers for a cash price approximating their principal amount  adjusted for an acquisition fee which may either increase or decrease the contract purchase price  and generate cash flow over a period of years 
as a result  the company has been dependent on warehouse credit facilities to purchase contracts  and on the availability of cash from outside sources in order to finance its continuing operations  as well as to fund the portion of contract purchase prices not financed under revolving warehouse credit facilities 
as of december   the company had million in warehouse credit capacity  in the form of a million facility and a million facility 
the first facility provides funding for contracts purchased under the tfc programs while both warehouse facilities provide funding for contracts purchased under the cps programs 
a third facility in the amount of million  which the company utilized to fund contracts under the cps and tfc programs  was terminated by the company on june  the million warehouse facility is structured to allow cps to fund a portion of the purchase price of contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by its consolidated subsidiary page three funding  llc 
this facility was established on november   and expires on november   although it is renewable with the mutual agreement of the parties 
up to of the principal balance of contracts may be advanced to the company under this facility  subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants 
notes under this facility accrue interest at a rate of one month libor plus per annum 
at december   million was outstanding under this facility 
the million warehouse facility is similarly structured to allow cps to fund a portion of the purchase price of contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by its consolidated subsidiary page funding llc 
this facility was entered into on june  on june  the facility was increased from million to million and further amended to provide for funding for contracts purchased under the tfc programs 
it was increased again to million on august  approximately of the principal balance of contracts may be advanced to the company under this facility  subject to collateral tests and certain other conditions and covenants 
notes under this facility accrue interest at a rate of one month libor plus per annum 
the lender has annual termination options at its sole discretion on each june through  at which time the agreement expires 
at december    was outstanding under this facility  compared to zero at december  the million warehouse facility was structured to allow the company to fund a portion of the purchase price of contracts by drawing against a floating rate variable funding note issued by its consolidated subsidiary cps warehouse trust 
this facility was established on march   and the maximum amount was increased to million in november up to of the principal balance of contracts could have been advanced to the company under this facility bore interest at a rate of one month commercial paper plus per annum 
this facility was due to expire on april   but the company elected to terminate it on it june  at december   million was outstanding under this facility 
the company securitized million of contracts in five private placement transactions during the year ended december  compared to million in five private placements during all of these transactions were structured as secured financings and  therefore  resulted in no gain on sale 
during the year ended december   the company securitized million of contracts in four private placement transactions 
the first two such transactions of were structured as sales for financial accounting purposes  resulting in a gain on sale of million net of a negative fair value adjustment of million related to the performance of previously securitized pools 
the final two transactions of were structured as secured financings and  therefore  resulted in no gain on sale 
in march  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiary of the company issued million of asset backed notes secured by its retained interest in eight term securitization transactions 
the notes had an interest rate of per annum and a final maturity in october and were required to be repaid from the distributions on the underlying retained interests 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  the company incurred and capitalized issuance costs of million 
the company repaid the notes in full in august in november  the company completed a similar securitization whereby a wholly owned bankruptcy remote consolidated subsidiary of the company issued million of asset backed notes secured by its retained interest in term securitization transactions 
these notes  which bear interest at a blended interest rate of per annum and have a final maturity in july  are required to be repaid from the distributions on the underlying retained interests 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  the company incurred and capitalized issuance costs of for the portfolio owned by non consolidated subsidiaries  cash used to increase credit enhancement amounts to required levels for the years ended december   and was zero  million  million  respectively 
cash released from trusts and their related spread accounts to the company related to the portfolio owned by consolidated subsidiaries for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
changes in the amount of credit enhancement required for term securitization transactions and releases from trusts and their related spread accounts are affected by the relative size  seasoning and performance of the various pools of contracts securitized that make up the company s managed portfolio to which the respective spread accounts are related 
during the years ended december  and december  the company made no initial deposits to spread accounts and funded no initial overcollateralization related to its term securitization transactions owned by non consolidated subsidiaries  compared to million in the acquisition of contracts for subsequent sale in securitization transactions  and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization  if any  and increase credit enhancement levels when those transactions take place  results in a continuing need for capital 
the amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the company s contract purchases  the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations  and the extent to which the previously established trusts and their related spread accounts either release cash to the company or capture cash from collections on securitized contracts 
the company is currently limited in its ability to purchase contracts due to certain liquidity constraints 
as of december   the company had cash on hand of million and available contract purchase commitments from its warehouse credit facilities of million 
the company s plans to manage the need for liquidity include the completion of additional term securitizations that would provide additional credit availability from the warehouse credit facilities  and matching its levels of contract purchases to its availability of cash 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete term securitizations on favorable economic terms or that the company will be able to complete term securitizations at all 
if the company is unable to complete such securitizations  interest income and other portfolio related income would decrease 
the company s primary means of ensuring that its cash demands do not exceed its cash resources is to match its levels of contract purchases to its availability of cash 
the company s ability to adjust the quantity of contracts that it purchases and securitizes will be subject to general competitive conditions and the continued availability of warehouse credit facilities 
there can be no assurance that the desired level of contract acquisition can be maintained or increased 
while the specific terms and mechanics of each spread account vary among transactions  the company s securitization agreements generally provide that the company will receive excess cash flows only if the amount of credit enhancement has reached specified levels and or the delinquency  defaults or net losses related to the contracts in the pool are below certain predetermined levels 
in the event delinquencies  defaults or net losses on the contracts exceed such levels  the terms of the securitization i may require increased credit enhancement to be accumulated for the particular pool  ii may restrict the distribution to the company of excess cash flows associated with other pools  or iii in certain circumstances  may permit the insurers to require the transfer of servicing on some or all of the contracts to another servicer 
there can be no assurance that collections from the related trusts will continue to generate sufficient cash 
certain of the company s securitization transactions and the warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results 
such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels and maximum financial losses 
in addition  certain securitization and non securitization related debt contain cross default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility 
the servicing agreements of the company s securitization transactions are terminable by the note insurers in the event of certain defaults by the company and under certain other circumstances 
were a note insurer in the future to exercise its option to terminate the servicing agreements  such a termination would have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and results of operations 
the company continues to receive servicer extensions on a monthly and or quarterly basis  pursuant to the servicing agreements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s material contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payment due by period less than to to more than total year years years years long term debt    operating leases    securitization trust debt  in the aggregate amount of million as of december   is omitted from this table because it becomes due as and when the related receivables balance is reduced

capital resources as noted above  million of long term debt matures prior to december   although the company repaid million of such debt in january the company plans to repay its long term debt from a combination of the following i additional proceeds from the offering of renewable notes  ii a possible transaction similar to the financing that it undertook in march and november where the company issued notes secured by its residual interests in securitizations  and iii possible senior secured financing similar to its existing outstanding senior secured financing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete these transactions 
securitization trust debt is repaid from collections on the related receivables  and becomes due in accordance with its terms as the principal amount of the related receivables is reduced 
although the securitization trust debt also has alternative maximum maturity dates  those dates are significantly later than the dates at which repayment of the related receivables is anticipated  and at no time in the company s history have any of its sponsored asset backed securities reached those alternative maximum maturities 
the acquisition of contracts for subsequent transfer in securitization transactions  and the need to fund spread accounts and initial overcollateralization  if any  when those transactions take place  results in a continuing need for capital 
the amount of capital required is most heavily dependent on the rate of the company s contract purchases  the required level of initial credit enhancement in securitizations  and the extent to which the trusts and related spread accounts either release cash to the company or capture cash from collections on securitized contracts 
the company plans to adjust its levels of contract purchases so as to match anticipated releases of cash from the trusts and related spread accounts with its capital requirements

new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r as amended  share based payment fas r or the statement 
fas r and related interpretations require that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
fas r permits entities to use any option pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the statement 
modifications of share based payments will be treated as replacement awards with the cost of the incremental value recorded in the financial statements 
the statement is effective at the beginning of and will therefore be effective for the company s first quarter of as of the effective date  the company will apply the statement using a modified version of prospective application 
under that transition method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  cancelled  or repurchased after that date and the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas as a result of the acceleration of vesting on all options outstanding in december see note there will be no effect on the company s adoption of the statement in relating to such options currently outstanding

 accounting for certain hybrid instruments 
this statement amends the guidance in fasb statements no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
statement allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis

statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after january  the company does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on the company s financial position or operations 
off balance sheet arrangements prior to july  the company structured its securitization transactions to meet the accounting criteria for sales of finance receivables 
in this structure the notes issued by the company s special purpose subsidiary do not appear as debt on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
see critical accounting policies for a detailed discussion of the company s securitization structure 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk during the period between when contracts are purchased from dealers and when such contracts become part of a term securitization 
specifically  the interest rates on the warehouse facilities are adjustable while the interest rates on the contracts are fixed 
historically  the company s term securitization facilities have had fixed rates of interest 
to mitigate some of this risk  the company has in the past  and intends to continue to  structure certain of its securitization transactions to include pre funding structures  whereby the amount of notes issued exceeds the amount of contracts initially sold to the trusts 
in pre funding  the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until the company sells the additional contracts to the trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre funded escrow account 
in pre funded securitizations  the company locks in the borrowing costs with respect to the contracts it subsequently delivers to the trust 
however  the company incurs an expense in pre funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the notes outstanding  the amount as to which there can be no assurance 
the following table provides information on the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments by expected maturity date as of december thereafter fair value in thousands assets finance receivables        weighted average fixed effective interest rate 
liabilities warehouse lines of credit   weighted average variable effective interest rate residual interest financing      fixed interest rate securitization trust debt        weighted average fixed effective interest rate 
senior secured debt   fixed interest rate subordinated renewable notes 
   weighted average fixed effective interest rate 
subordinated debt   fixed interest rate includes approximately million in unfunded contracts that are included in restricted cash at december  as a result of a prefunding structure 
much of the information used to determine fair value is highly subjective 
when applicable  readily available market information has been utilized 
however  for a significant portion of the company s financial instruments  active markets do not exist 
therefore  considerable judgments were required in estimating fair value for certain items 
the subjective factors include  among other things  the estimated timing and amount of cash flows  risk characteristics  credit quality and interest rates  all of which are subject to change 
since the fair value is estimated as of the dates shown in the table  the amounts that will actually be realized or paid at settlement or maturity of the instruments could be significantly different
