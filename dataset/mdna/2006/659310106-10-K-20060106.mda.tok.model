item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary the trust is a passive fixed investment trust which holds overriding royalty rights  receives income under those rights from certain operating companies  pays its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its unit owners 
the trust is not involved in any business or extractive operations of any kind in the areas over which it holds royalty rights and is precluded from any such involvement by the trust agreement 
there are no requirements  therefore  for capital resources with which to make capital expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of royalty revenues by the trust 
the operating companies  subsidiaries of exxonmobil corp 
and the royal dutch shell group  pay monthly royalties to the trust based on their sales of natural gas  sulfur and oil 
the oldenburg concession is the primary area from which these products are extracted and provides nearly of all the royalties received by the trust 
of these three products  natural gas provides approximately of the total royalties 
the gas is sold to various distributors under long term contracts which set forth  among other provisions  the timing  manner  volume and price of the gas sold 
the pricing mechanisms contained in these contracts include a delay factor of three to six months and use the price of light heating oil in germany as one of the primary pricing components 
since germany must import a large percentage of its energy requirements  the us dollar price of oil on the international market has a significant  although delayed  impact on the price of gas 
a strong euro would tend to reduce the cost of oil being imported into germany and likely result in a lower price for light heating oil and a reduction in the amount of royalties paid to the trust in germany 
however  a strong euro would also result in an increase in the amount of royalties received when the royalties  originally received in euros  are converted into dollars and transferred to the trust s bank account in the us a weak euro would have the opposite effect 
however  it is important to note that the price of imported oil and the euro dollar relationship are only two of the numerous factors that can affect the price of light heating oil 
the trust does not conduct any active business operations and has only limited need of funds for its own administrative services 
these funds are used to pay trustees fees computed under the trust agreement and based upon a percentage of royalties and interest income received  the remuneration fixed by the trustees for the managing trustee  the managing director and the audit committee chairman  expenses associated with the trustees meetings  professional fees paid to consultants  legal advisors and auditors  transfer agent fees  and secretarial and other general office expenses 
another requirement for funds by the trust relates to the occasional necessity of making lump sum payments of arrearages of dividends of a corporate predecessor and distributions previously declared by the trust 
the payment of such arrearages would require a reduction in the amount of distributions which otherwise would be made on presently outstanding units 
however  except for one claim begun before the cut off date of june   pursuant to the provisions of the order of the delaware court of chancery of april   further liability for payment of dividends or distributions arrears has been eliminated 
for further information on this contingent liability and the impact of the delaware court order see note to financial statements in item of this report 
the trust has no means of ensuring continued income from overriding royalty rights at their present level or otherwise 
economic and political factors which are not foreseeable may have an impact on trust income 
the effect of changing economic conditions on the demand for energy throughout the world and future prices of oil and gas cannot be accurately projected 
the trust s current consultant in germany provides general information to the trust on the german and european economies and energy markets 
this information provides a context in which to evaluate the actions of the operating companies 
in his position as consultant he receives reports from the operating companies with respect to current and planned drilling and exploration efforts 
however  the unified exploration and production venture  empg  which provides the reports to the trust s consultant  continues to limit the information flow to that which is required by german law 
the relatively small amounts required for administrative expenses of the trust limit the possible effect of inflation on its financial prospects 
continued price inflation would be reflected in sales prices  which with sales volumes form the basis on which the royalties paid to the trust are computed 
in addition  fluctuations in the euro dollar exchange rate have an impact on domestic energy prices within germany and on the amount of dollars received by the trust upon conversion 
the impact of inflation or deflation on energy prices in germany is delayed by the use in certain long term gas sales contracts of a deferred trailing average related to light fuel oil prices 
results fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s gross royalty income increased from  to  increases in gas prices under both the higher and lower royalty rate agreements  higher gas sales from the higher royalty rate area of western oldenburg and a higher average value for the euro resulted in the higher royalty income and  as a result  higher distributions 
the only negative factor impacting royalty income was lower gas sales from eastern oldenburg 
under the higher royalty rate agreement with mobil erdgas covering western oldenburg  gas sales increased from billion cubic feet bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal gas sales strengthened each quarter throughout fiscal until the final quarter when maintenance work at the desulfurization plant slowed production 
a comparison to the prior year gas sales for the first through fourth quarters of fiscal showed changes of   and  respectively 
the trust s management believes that this turnaround is at least partially the result of the new compressors that came on line in late and the new western wells completed in average gas prices for gas sold from this royalty area increased from euro cents per kilowatt hour ecents kwh in fiscal to ecents kwh in fiscal for fiscal the average gas price for each quarter posted an increase over the prior year s corresponding quarter 
under the lower royalty rate agreement with beb covering the entire oldenburg concession  gas sales declined from bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal a comparison to the prior year gas sales for the first through fourth quarters of fiscal showed changes of   and  respectively 
average gas prices for gas sold from this royalty area increased from ecents kwh in fiscal to ecents kwh in fiscal for fiscal the average gas price for each quarter posted an increase over the prior year s corresponding quarter 
from its high point in november  the euro steadily declined throughout fiscal in relation to the us dollar 
using the cumulative transfer of royalties from germany to the us to generate an average value for the euro  there was a increase in the average value from for fiscal to for fiscal interest income for fiscal was higher due to the combination of rising interest rates and increased funds available for investment 
trust expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal a number of expense items not part of the normal yearly trust expenses were incurred this year 
the expenses associated with the biennial examination of the operating companies in germany to confirm the accuracy of the royalty payments added  to the expense total 
payment of a portion of the fees of the trust s german consultant was made early in fiscal  which added  to the expense total 
the resolution of the trust s contingent liability for arrearage payments to previously unlocated shareholders resulted in additional legal expenses compared to fiscal the operating companies provide reports to the trust s german consultant detailing their plans for exploration and drilling for the upcoming calendar year and the results of that program for the current calendar year 
the trust s consultant has extracted the following information from those reports 
the operating companies expanded drilling program continued throughout goldenstedt z a was successfully completed in march with a horizontal deviation of  feet 
after construction of production facilities was completed  production began in september hemmelte z a  this year s one western well  was completed in mid june but due to geological constraints did not fully penetrate the total reservoir section as originally planned 
this would appear to have had an impact of the well s productivity 
however  following the completion of the production facilities  production began in october doetlingen ost z  an exploratory well  began drilling in june intended to penetrate to a total depth of  feet with a horizontal deviation of  feet  the drilling encountered massive technical problems which delayed completion of the well until mid november while no production tests were carried out  numerous gas shows occurred during the drilling and well logging confirmed a gas discovery 
once production facilities are completed  production is expected to begin in the middle of oythe z was a new vertical well planned to replace oythe z  which suffered a casing collapse 
drilling began in september but significant technical difficulties forced the operators to plug the initial drilling with cement and redrill 
now designated oythe z a  the well is scheduled for completion in march a new well  doetlingen z a  originally scheduled for has been pushed forward to december with an expected completion of march this well is planned as a horizontal deviation of approximately feet 
for  two new wells  goldenstedt z a and varnhorn z a  are planned 
both are horizontal deviations from existing wells located in eastern oldenburg 
results fiscal versus fiscal for fiscal the trust s gross royalty income decreased from  to  the decline in gas sales and the drop in gas prices combined to push royalty income lower 
the increase in the average value of the euro contributed to the drop in gas prices but helped offset the decline in royalties by increasing the amount of dollars received when the royalties were transferred to the us under the higher royalty rate agreement with mobil erdgas covering western oldenburg  gas sales declined from bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal in comparison to the prior year s equivalent quarter  each quarter showed a decline 
with the exception of the first quarter of fiscal  gas sales for each quarter showed a drop from those of the immediately preceding quarter 
the drop in reservoir pressure that continued throughout the year was not addressed until the month of october when the new compressors came on line and was not be fully addressed until the completion of some remaining minor construction work 
average gas prices for gas sold from this royalty area declined from ecents kwh in fiscal to ecents kwh in fiscal under the lower royalty rate agreement with beb covering the entire oldenburg concession  gas sales declined from bcf in fiscal to bcf in fiscal the overall gas sales showed the same pattern as gas sales from western oldenburg in comparison to the prior year and the immediately preceding quarter 
average gas prices for gas sold from this royalty area declined from ecents kwh in fiscal to ecents kwh in fiscal the euro continued its strong performance against the dollar throughout fiscal and in late november reached its highest point yet at a dollar equivalent value of 
using the cumulative transfer of royalties from germany to the us to generate an average value for the euro  there was an increase in the average value from for fiscal to for fiscal interest income for fiscal was lower due to the low interest rates that remained in effect and the reduced funds available for investment 
trust expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the absence of expenses associated with the biennial examination of the operating companies in germany to confirm the accuracy of the royalty payments resulted in the lower level of expenses 
the operating companies provide reports to the trust s german consultant detailing their plans for exploration and drilling for the upcoming calendar year and the results of that program for the current calendar year 
the trust s consultant has extracted the following information from those reports 
the operating companies were involved in a construction and drilling program throughout in an effort to increase gas production and sales 
the two new compressor units completed a four week testing period at the end of september and since then have been in full operation 
initially some remaining construction work limited production levels to a rate of million cubic feet per day ft d 
when all construction was completed  this production figure rose to the expected levels of million ft d 
the operating companies pursued an expanded drilling program during kneheim z  a production well located in western oldenburg  began production in mid september 
hemmelte z a  a horizontal deviation off an existing western production well  began production in mid october 
the deviation presented particular difficulties that were successfully addressed 
goldenstedt z a  a horizontal deviation off an existing production well in eastern oldenburg  had been completed with production beginning in march using a high tech geo steering procedure the operators were able to extend the horizontal deviation approximately  feet in length 
sage z  an exploratory well located in eastern oldenburg  has been completed 
preliminary indications are that this well may have tapped a separate geological block but final confirmation will not be possible until the second half of construction of a new gas treatment plant and a field pipeline was necessary but production finally began in may the operating companies indicated that they will continue their expanded drilling program into with four additional wells planned 
two horizontal deviations off existing wells were planned 
the eastern well  goldenstedt z a  began drilling in mid december and was successfully completed in march the western well  hemmelte z a  began drilling in april and was successfully completed in june a new production well in eastern oldenburg  oythe z  to replace an existing well that suffered a casing collapse  was scheduled for a drilling start in september technical difficulties have delayed its completion until march a new exploratory well in eastern oldenburg  doetlingen ost z  was scheduled for a drilling start in june and was successfully completed in mid november this well was targeted to test a new geological reservoir 
critical accounting policies the financial statements  appearing subsequently in this report  present financial statement balances and financial results on a cash basis of accounting  which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap basis 
cash basis accounting is an accepted accounting method for royalty trusts such as the trust 
cash basis financial statements disclose revenue when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid 
gaap basis financial statements disclose income as earned and expenses as incurred  without regard to receipts or payments 
the sole exception to the use of the cash basis of accounting is the accrual for distributions to be paid to unit owners those distributions approved by the trustees for the trust 
the trust s distributable income represents royalty income received by the trust during the period plus interest income less any expenses incurred by the trust  all on a cash basis 
in the opinion of the trustees  the use of the cash basis provides a more meaningful presentation to unit owners of the results of operations of the trust and presents to the unit owners a more accurate calculation of income and expenses for tax reporting purposes 
this report on form k contains forward looking statements concerning business  financial performance and financial condition of the trust 
many of these statements are based on information provided to the trust by the operating companies or by consultants using public information sources 
these statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any forward looking statements 
these include uncertainties concerning levels of gas production and gas sale prices  general economic conditions and currency exchange rates 
actual results and events may vary significantly from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the trust does not engage in any trading activities with respect to possible foreign exchange fluctuations 
the trust does not use any financial instruments to hedge against possible risks related to foreign exchange fluctuations 
the market risk is negligible because standing instructions at its german bank require the bank to process transfers of royalty payments as soon as possible following their receipt 
the trust does not engage in any trading activities with respect to possible commodity price fluctuations
