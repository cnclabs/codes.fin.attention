item a 
risk factors we wish to caution you that there are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those indicated by forward looking statements that we make from time to time in filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases  reports  proxy statements  registration statements and other written communications as well as oral forward looking statements made from time to time by our representatives 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those risks described below 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or those we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations  and historical results are not necessarily an indication of the future results 
the cautionary statements below discuss important factors that could cause our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows to be materially adversely affected 
changes in general economic conditions could have a material impact on our business our results of operations could be impacted by changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending 
future economic conditions affecting disposable income such as employment levels  consumer confidence  business conditions  stock market volatility  weather conditions  acts of terrorism  threats of war  and interest and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or cause consumers to shift their spending away from our products 
if the economic conditions and performance of the retail and media environment worsen  we may experience material adverse impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition 
increased competition could impact our financial results we believe that the lohas market has thousands of small  local and regional businesses 
some smaller businesses may be able to more effectively personalize their relationships with customers  thereby gaining a competitive advantage 
although we believe that we do not compete directly with any single company that offers our entire range of merchandise  within each merchandise category we have competitors and we may face competition from new entrants 
some of our competitors or our potential competitors may have greater financial and marketing resources and greater brand recognition 
in addition  larger  well established and well financed entities may acquire  invest in or form joint ventures with our competitors 
increased competition from these or other competitors could negatively impact our business 
changing consumer preferences may have an adverse effect on our business our business is targeted at consumers who assign high value to personal development  healthy lifestyles  responsible media  renewable energy and the environment 
a decrease of consumer interest in purchasing goods and services that promote the values we espouse would materially and adversely affect our customer base and sales revenues and  accordingly  our financial prospects 
further  consumer preferences and product trends are difficult to predict 
our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences and we may not respond in a timely or commercially appropriate manner to such changes 
failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends could lead to  among other things  lower sales of our products  increased merchandise returns and lower margins  which would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our strategy of offering branded products could lead to inventory risk and higher costs an important part of our strategy is to feature branded products 
these products are sold under our brand names and are manufactured to our specifications 
we expect our reliance on branded merchandise to increase 
the use of branded merchandise requires us to incur costs and risks relating to the design and purchase of products  including submitting orders earlier and making longer initial purchase commitments 
in addition  the use of branded merchandise limits our ability to return unsold products to vendors  which can result in higher markdowns in order to sell excess inventory 
our commitment to customer service typically results in us keeping a high level of merchandise in stock so we can fill orders quickly 
consequently  we run the risk of having excess inventory  which may also contribute to higher markdowns 
our failure to successfully execute a branded merchandise strategy or to achieve anticipated profit margins on these goods  or a higher than anticipated level of overstocks  may materially adversely affect our revenues 
we offer our customers liberal merchandise return policies 
our consolidated financial statements include a reserve for anticipated merchandise returns  which is based on historical return rates 
it is possible that actual returns may increase as a result of factors such as the introduction of new merchandise  changes in merchandise mix or other factors 
any increase in our merchandise returns will correspondingly reduce our revenues 
acquisitions may harm our financial results acquisitions have been part of our growth and may continue to be part of our growth in the future 
our acquisitions may be of entire companies  certain assets of companies  controlling interests in companies or of minority interests in companies where we intend to invest as part of a strategic alliance 
if we are not successful in integrating companies that we acquire or are not able to generate adequate sales from the acquired entities  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
the loss of the services of our key personnel could disrupt our business we depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel  particularly jirka rysavy and lynn powers 
our strategy of allowing the management teams of some acquired companies to continue to exercise significant management responsibility for those companies makes it important that we retain key employees  particularly the sales and creative teams  of the companies we might acquire 
our founder and chief executive officer jirka rysavy controls gaiam mr 
rysavy holds of gaiam s  outstanding shares of class b common stock and also owns  shares of class a common stock 
the shares of class b common stock are convertible into shares of class a common stock at any time 
each share of class b common stock has ten votes per share  and each share of class a common stock has one vote per share 
consequently  mr 
rysavy is able to vote a majority of our stock  and will be able to exert substantial influence over gaiam and to control matters requiring approval by the shareholders of gaiam  including the election of directors  increasing our authorized capital stock  or a merger or sale of our assets 
as a result of mr 
rysavy s control  no change of control of gaiam can occur without mr 
rysavy s consent 
in  mr 
rysavy entered into certain agreements with revolution living  llc and its founder  steve case that could have a negative impact on gaiam 
in  gaiam recorded a thousand expense for its share of losses at revolution living s lime media 
our success depends on the value of the gaiam brand because of our reliance on sales of proprietary products  our success depends on the gaiam brand 
building and maintaining recognition of the gaiam brand are important to attracting and expanding our customer base 
if the value of the gaiam brand were adversely affected  we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract new customers  retain existing customers or encourage repeat purchases  and if the value of our brand were to diminish  our revenues  results of operations and prospects would be adversely affected 
disputes concerning media content and intellectual property may adversely affect us most of our media content is subject to arrangements with third parties pursuant to which we have licensed certain rights to use and distribute media content owned by third parties or have licensed to third parties certain rights to use and distribute media content that we own 
in addition  we have a number of agreements with third parties concerning the use of our media content and intellectual property  including agreements regarding royalties  distribution  duplication  etc 
allegations that we do not have rights to use media content and other disputes arising from such arrangements can be costly and may have a material adverse impact on our results 
we are dependent on third party suppliers for the success of our proprietary products we are dependent on the success of our proprietary products  and we rely on a select group of manufacturers to provide us with sufficient quantities to meet our customers demands in a timely manner  produce these products in a humane and safe environment for both their workers and the planet  maintain quality standards consistent with the gaiam brand  and meet certain pricing guarantees 
our sourcing of these products overseas continues to increase  and these arrangements carry risks associated with relying on products manufactured outside of the us  including political unrest and trade restrictions  currency fluctuations  transportation difficulties  work stoppages  and other uncertainties 
in addition  a number of our suppliers are small companies  and some of these vendors may not have sufficient capital  resources or personnel to increase their sales to us or to meet our needs for increased commitments from them 
the failure of our suppliers to provide sufficient quantities of our proprietary products could decrease our revenues  increase our costs  and damage our customer service reputation 
we rely on communications and shipping networks to deliver our products given our emphasis on customer service  the efficient and uninterrupted operation of order processing and fulfillment functions is critical to our business 
to maintain a high level of customer service  we rely heavily on a number of different outside service providers  such as printers  telecommunications companies and delivery companies 
any interruption in services from our principal outside service providers  including delays or disruptions resulting from labor disputes  power outages  human error  adverse weather conditions or natural disasters  could materially adversely affect our business 
in addition  products that we source overseas must be shipped to our distribution center by freight carriers  and a work stoppage or political unrest could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our customer orders 
information systems upgrades or integrations may disrupt our operations or financial reporting we continually evaluate and upgrade our management information systems  which are critical to our business 
these systems assist in processing orders  managing inventory  purchasing and shipping merchandise on a timely basis  responding to customer service inquiries  and gathering and analyzing operating data by business segment  customer  and sku a specific identifier for each different product 
we are required to continually update these systems 
furthermore  if we acquire other companies  we will need to integrate the acquired companies systems with ours  a process that could be time consuming and costly 
if our systems cannot accommodate our growth or if they fail  we could incur substantial expenses 
additionally  our success in e commerce will depend upon our ability to provide a compelling and satisfying shopping experience 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our online technology 
a material security breach could cause us to lose sales  damage our reputation or result in liability to us our computer servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
we may need to expend significant additional capital and other resources to protect against a security breach or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
our relationships with our customers may be adversely affected if the security measures that we use to protect personal information such as credit card numbers are ineffective 
we currently rely on security and authentication technology that we license from third parties 
we may not prevent all security breaches 
our systems may fail or limit user traffic  which would cause us to lose sales we support most of our business through our call center in broomfield  colorado 
even though we have back up arrangements  we are dependent on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications equipment in this center in effective working order and to protect against damage from fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failure or similar events 
in addition  growth of our customer base may strain or exceed the capacity of our computer and telecommunications systems and lead to degradations in performance or systems failure 
we have experienced capacity constraints and failure of information systems in the past that have resulted in decreased levels of service delivery or interruptions in service to customers for limited periods of time 
although we continually review and consider upgrades to our technical infrastructure and provide for system redundancies and backup power to limit the likelihood of systems overload or failure  substantial damage to our systems or a systems failure that causes interruptions for a number of days could adversely affect our business 
additionally  if we are unsuccessful in updating and expanding our infrastructure  including our call center  our ability to grow may be constrained 
government regulation of the internet and e commerce is evolving and unfavorable changes could harm our business we are subject to general business regulations and laws  as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet and e commerce 
such existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the internet or other online services 
these regulations and laws may cover taxation  user privacy  pricing  content  copyrights  distribution  consumer protection  the provision of online payment services and quality of products and services 
there is lack of clarity on how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  sales and other taxes and personal privacy apply to the internet and e commerce 
unfavorable resolution of these issues may harm our business 
we may face legal liability for the content contained on our website we could face legal liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement  personal injury or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we publish or distribute on our website 
if we are held liable for damages for the content on our website  our business may suffer 
further  one of our goals is for www 
gaiam 
com to be a trustworthy and dependable provider of information and services 
allegations of impropriety  even if unfounded  could therefore have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business 
relying on our centralized fulfillment center could expose us to losing revenue prompt and efficient fulfillment of our customers orders is critical to our business 
our facility in cincinnati  ohio handles our fulfillment functions and some customer service related operations  such as returns processing 
a majority of our orders are filled and shipped from the cincinnati facility 
the balance is shipped directly from suppliers 
because we rely on a centralized fulfillment center  our fulfillment functions could be severely impaired in the event of fire  extended adverse weather conditions  transportation difficulties or natural disasters 
because we recognize revenue only when we ship orders  interruption of our shipping would diminish our revenues 
we may face quarterly and seasonal fluctuations that could harm our business our revenue and results of operations have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of a number of factors  including the timing of catalog offerings  timing of orders from retailers  recognition of costs or net sales contributed by new merchandise  fluctuations in response rates  fluctuations in paper  production and postage costs and expenses  merchandise returns  adverse weather conditions that affect distribution or shipping  shifts in the timing of holidays and changes in our merchandise mix 
in particular  our net sales and profits have historically been higher during the fourth quarter holiday season 
we believe that this seasonality will continue in the future 
postage and shipping costs may increase and therefore increase our expenses we ship our products  catalogs  and lifestyle publications to consumers and the cost of shipping is a material expenditure 
postage and shipping prices increase periodically and can be expected to increase in the future 
any inability to secure suitable or commercially favorable prices or other terms for the delivery of our merchandise and catalogs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business is subject to reporting requirements that continue to evolve and change  which could continue to require significant compliance effort and resources 
because our common stock is publicly traded  we are subject to certain rules and regulations of federal  state and financial market exchange entities charged with the protection of investors and the oversight of companies whose securities are publicly traded 
these entities  including the public company accounting oversight board  the sec and the nasdaq  periodically issue new requirements and regulations and legislative bodies also review and revise applicable laws such as the sarbanes oxley act of as interpretation and implementation of these laws and rules and promulgation of new regulations continues  we will continue to be required to commit significant financial and managerial resources and incur additional expenses

this section is designed to provide information that will assist readers in understanding gaiam s consolidated financial statements  changes in certain items in those statements from year to year  the primary factors that caused those changes and how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect the consolidated financial statements 
overview and outlook gaiam is a lifestyle media company providing content  information  and product to customers who value personal development  healthy living and responsible media 
with the inception of our business segment in  gaiam started to sell directly to retailers  both domestically and abroad  and gaiam s products are now available in over  doors 
gaiam introduced its store within store lifestyle presentations  which utilize custom fixtures designed and produced by gaiam  in late  and the placement of this concept has grown to over  stores 
in  revenue in this segment was million 
in  revenue generated in this segment grew to million  as a result of revenue generated by acquisitions and acquired assets combined with a internal growth rate 
the direct to consumer segment continues to be an integral part of gaiam s core and has expanded to include greater reach through new club and membership programs and initiatives 
this segment accounted for approximately million of gaiam s revenue during during  revenue generated by internal growth of in this segment and the expansion into drtv  club and membership programs brought the total revenue generated by this segment to million  or of total revenue 
through is diverse media reach  the direct to consumer segment provides branding  an opportunity to launch and support new media releases  a sounding board for new product testing  promotional opportunities and customer feedback on gaiam s and the lohas lifestyles of health and sustainability industry s focus and future 
during  gaiam completed several acquisitions targeted towards expanding and enhancing our media content and reach 
in august  gaiam acquired a minority interest in revolution living s lime media  and  in december  acquired additional shares in conscious media  inc  bringing its total ownership to 
in september  gaiam acquired the majority of the assets of goodtimes entertainment and certain of its affiliates 
goodtimes entertainment s assets included entertainment programming  fitness media and accessories  and home video products distributed through various channels  including television  retailers and the internet 
goodtimes entertainment s library contained wellness franchises such as the firm and tae bo  children classics and theatrical releases 
we believe our growth will be driven by content  which is delivered in a variety of media formats  and through broadcast  internet  retailers  international licensing  and electronic and traditional paper delivery systems 
gaiam has increased its focus on its media content creation and distribution  which strategically provides increased branding opportunities  significantly higher operating contribution and greater mainstream penetration 
with the completion of these acquisitions and continued expansion and improvements in gaiam s core businesses  gaiam currently expects to generate over million in annual revenue during the volume increase will not only allow gaiam to achieve greater reach  it will also allow gaiam to negotiate better inventory and service pricing to improve margins  and more fully leverage its distribution capacity and overhead to produce better overall financial results 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in gaiam s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k summarizes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of gaiam s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following to be critical accounting policies whose application has a material impact on gaiam s financial presentation  and involve a higher degree of complexity  as they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
provisions for doubtful accounts and returns gaiam records a provision for doubtful accounts for all receivables not expected to be collected 
gaiam generally does not require collateral 
gaiam evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
when we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filings  gaiam records a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due 
for all other instances  gaiam recognizes reserves based on historical experience and review of individual accounts outstanding 
gaiam records a provision for product returns to be received in future periods at the time the original sale is recognized 
the amount of the returns provision is based upon historical experience and future expectations 
inventory inventory consists primarily of finished goods held for sale and is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
gaiam identifies the inventory items to be written down for obsolescence based on the item s current sales status and condition 
if the item is discontinued or slow moving  it is written down based on an estimate of the markdown to retail price needed to sell through its current stock level of the item 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed in a business acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  on a reporting unit level 
the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
gaiam has allocated goodwill to two reporting units  and uses a market value method for the purposes of testing for potential impairment 
the annual review requires extensive use of financial judgment and estimates 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as a change in the composition of a reporting unit  could yield significantly different results 
investments investments in corporations over which gaiam does not have the ability to exercise significant influence  and in which gaiam has a less than twenty percent ownership interest  are accounted for under the cost method 
under the cost method of accounting  investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value 
investments in limited liability companies in which gaiam does not have the ability to exercise significant influence or control  and in which it holds a five percent or more membership interest  are accounted for under the equity method 
under the equity method  gaiam records its share of the income or losses of the investment by increasing or decreasing the carrying value of its investment and recording the income or expense through the consolidated statement of operations 
investments under the cost and equity methods are included on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in investments 
capitalized production costs and media library capitalized production costs include costs incurred to produce media products marketed by gaiam to retailers and direct mail and online customers 
these costs are deferred for financial reporting purposes until the media is released  then amortized over succeeding periods on the basis of estimated sales 
historical sales statistics are the principal factor used in estimating the amortization rate 
gaiam s media library consists of titles and content purchased or acquired 
at acquisition  the fair market value of the library is established and is amortized over succeeding periods on the basis of its estimated useful life 
gaiam has not had any significant changes in its critical accounting policies from its form k filing for the fiscal year ended december  results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit expenses selling and operating corporate  general and administrative total expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes and minority interest income tax benefit expense minority interest in net income loss of consolidated subsidiary  net of tax net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue of million during was higher than the million in revenue generated in gaiam s increase in revenue primarily resulted from increased sales volume from content acquired in the goodtimes asset acquisition  which was coupled with a internal growth rate 
revenue in gaiam s direct to consumer segment was million in  an increase of million or over revenue of million  primarily resulting from the advent of club  membership and drtv revenue  in addition to a internal growth rate in the core components 
gaiam s business segment generated positive internal growth of for the year  and  including revenue generated by acquisitions  increased the total revenue generated by this segment by to million in from million in gross profit  which consists of revenue less cost of sales primarily merchandise cost plus inbound freight and duties  increased to million for from million during as a percentage of revenue  gross profit increased basis points to in from in this was primarily attributable to a sales mix change favoring media  on which gaiam generates significantly higher gross margins  and the cessation of markdowns and other costs associated with the format change from vhs to dvd which adversely affected results 
gross profit was also favorably impacted by improved pricing on dvds associated with the higher volume  and new direct to retailer access  rather than the use of third party distributors  on several new key accounts 
these improvements had the greatest impact on the business segment  as gross profit for this segment improved to in from in the direct to consumer segment also improved  as the gross profit in this segment increased to in  up from in selling and operating expenses increased to million for compared to million in the same period of  primarily resulting from increased sales and operating expenses to support the revenue increases described above  and transition expenses associated with the goodtimes asset acquisition

corporate  general and administration expenses increased to million in from million in  but decreased significantly to of revenue in from of revenue in this expense increase primarily resulted from increased facilities  systems and other infrastructure costs associated with the acquired assets and increased business volume 
as a result of the above factors  gaiam generated in income from operations  or of revenue  during  as compared to a million operating loss in  which was of revenue 
gaiam recorded thousand in other expense during and thousand in other income during in august  gaiam acquired a interest in revolution living s lime media  and recorded a one time thousand loss on this investment for the period from august  through december  this loss was partially offset by interest income of thousand for during  gaiam generated thousand in interest income

gaiam recorded an income tax expense of thousand for compared to an income tax benefit of million in gaiam s consolidated effective tax rate fluctuates based upon the distribution of earnings losses between its domestic and foreign operations 
as a result of the factors described above  gaiam improved its financial performance over in  gaiam produced net income of million  or per share  as compared to a net loss in of million or per share 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue of million during was lower than the million in revenue generated in gaiam s decrease in revenue was due to lower revenues from the business segment of million  or  as compared to fiscal year this shortfall resulted from lower sales volume in the us and canadian trade business  where net media revenue before markdowns  particularly those associated with lower sales and returns attributable to the change out of vhs format for dvd format  dropped by over as compared to the previous year 
additionally  revenue generated by the us business segment was adversely impacted by markdowns given to incent sell through of vhs tapes and kits containing vhs media  and markdowns given to target associated with sell through of products to prepare for an expansion of gaiam s shelf space  which took place at the end of september direct to consumer segment revenues increased to million for  compared to million for the same period in internal revenue growth in our internet businesses continued to be strong at  while our international business posted internal growth of for gross profit  which consists of revenue less cost of sales decreased to million for from million during as a percentage of revenue  gross profit declined to in from in this was primarily attributable to a decline in the business segment gross profit from in to in this decline in the business segment gross margin was primarily due to markdowns  inventory write offs and valuation reserves  and other expenses incurred with the changeover from vhs to dvd products 
gross profit by product line increased  particularly in accessories  but the weighted product revenue mix change from media to accessories resulted in lower overall gross margins 
this was partially offset by a favorable change in sales mix from the business segment to the direct to consumer segment  where gaiam has better overall margins 
selling and operating expenses increased to million for as compared to million in the same period of  primarily resulting from increased sales and marketing efforts in our direct to consumer segment to support the revenue increases described above  and expenses associated with doubling the business segment sales force

corporate  general and administration expenses decreased to million in from million in  and decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in this expense reduction was generally attributable to cost savings negotiated with service providers and other savings generated by the consolidation of administrative services into gaiam s colorado headquarters

as a result of the factors described above  gaiam s net loss was million for compared to a net loss of thousand recorded for quarterly and seasonal fluctuations the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in and in management s opinion  this unaudited financial information includes all adjustments  consisting solely of normal recurring accruals and adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations for the quarters presented 
this financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations 
fiscal first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter net revenue gross profit operating income loss net income loss diluted net income loss per share weighted average shares outstanding diluted fiscal first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter net revenue gross profit operating income loss net income loss diluted net income loss per share weighted average shares outstanding diluted note the aggregate of certain of the above amounts differs from that reported for the full fiscal year due to the effects of rounding 
quarterly fluctuations in gaiam s revenues and operating results are due to a number of factors  including the timing of new product introductions and mailings to customers  advertising  acquisitions including costs of acquisitions and expenses related to integration of acquisitions  competition  pricing of products by vendors and expenditures on our systems and infrastructure 
the impact on revenue and operating results due to the timing and extent of these factors can be significant 
our sales are also affected by seasonal influences 
on an aggregate basis  gaiam generates its strongest revenues and net income in the fourth quarter due to increased holiday spending 
liquidity and capital resources gaiam s capital needs arise from working capital required to fund our operations  capital expenditures related to acquisition and development of media content  development of internet and new products  acquisitions of new businesses  replacements  expansions and improvements to gaiam s infrastructure  and future growth 
these capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the rate of market acceptance of gaiam s product offerings  our ability to expand gaiam s customer base  the cost of ongoing upgrades to gaiam s product offerings  our level of expenditures for sales and marketing  our level of investment in distribution systems and facilities and other factors 
the timing and amount of these capital requirements are variable and cannot accurately be predicted 
additionally  gaiam will continue to pursue opportunities to expand our media libraries  evaluate possible investments in businesses  products and technologies including broadband  subscription clubs and online community  and increase our sales and marketing programs and brand promotions as needed 
gaiam has a credit agreement with wells fargo  which permits borrowings of up to million based upon the collateral value of gaiam s accounts receivable and inventory 
at december   gaiam had no amounts outstanding under this agreement and complied with all of the financial covenants

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
any borrowings we might make under our bank credit facility would bear interest at the lower of prime rate less basis points or libor plus basis points 
gaiam does not have any amounts outstanding under its credit line  so any unfavorable change in interest rates would not have a material impact on gaiam s results from operations or cash flows unless gaiam makes borrowings in the future 
gaiam purchases a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are primarily us dollar denominated transactions 
because the percentage of our international purchases denominated in currencies other than the us dollar is small  any currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to gaiam 
a decline in the relative value of the us dollar to other foreign currencies could  however  lead to increased purchasing costs 
in order to mitigate this exposure  gaiam makes virtually all of its purchase commitments in us dollars 
in  gaiam purchased a interest in gaiam limited  formerly known as leisure systems international limited  a uk based distributor 
because gaiam limited s revenues are primarily denominated in foreign currencies  this investment exposes gaiam to accounting risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
