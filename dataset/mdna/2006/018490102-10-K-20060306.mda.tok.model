item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this financial review presents our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our financial condition at december  except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under item a 
risk factors of this report 
in addition  the following review should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels of our products at an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales 
we generally offer cash discounts to customers for the early payment of receivables 
those discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable in the same period that the related sale is recorded 
the amounts reserved for cash discounts were million and million at december  and  respectively 
provisions for cash discounts deducted from consolidated sales in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we permit returns of product from any product line by any class of customer if such product is returned in a timely manner  in good condition and from normal distribution channels 
return policies in certain international markets provide for more stringent guidelines in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements with customers 
allowances for returns are provided for based upon our historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated  and management s evaluation of specific factors that increase the risk of returns 
the amount of allowances for sales returns accrued at december  and were million and million  respectively 
provisions for sales returns deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
historical allowances for cash discounts and product returns have been within the amounts reserved or accrued  respectively 
additionally  we participate in various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs  the largest of which relates to medicaid 
sales rebate and other incentive programs also include chargebacks  which are contractual discounts given primarily to federal government agencies  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefits managers and group purchasing organizations 
sales rebates and incentive accruals reduce revenue in the same period that the related sale is recorded and are included in other accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the million increase in the amount accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs is primarily due to a difference in the timing of when payments were made against accrued amounts at december  compared to december  and an increase in the ratio of us pharmaceutical product sales  principally eye care pharmaceutical products  which are subject to such rebate and incentive programs 
provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in the provision for sales rebates and other incentive programs during and compared to the corresponding prior year is primarily due to an increase in the ratio of us pharmaceutical product sales  principally eye care pharmaceutical products  which are subject to such rebates and incentive programs 
in addition  an increase in our published list prices in the united states for pharmaceutical products generally results in a higher ratio of provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs deducted from consolidated sales 
our procedures for estimating amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs at the end of any period are based on available quantitative data and are supplemented by management s judgment with respect to many factors  including  but not limited to  current market place dynamics  changes in contract terms  changes in sales trends  an evaluation of current laws and regulations and product pricing 
quantitatively  we use historical sales  product utilization and rebate data and apply forecasting techniques in order to estimate our liability amounts 
qualitatively  management s judgment is applied to these items to modify  if appropriate  the estimated liability amounts 
there are inherent risks in this process 
for example  customers may not achieve assumed utilization levels  customers may misreport their utilization to us  and actual movements of the us consumer price index urban cpi u  which affect our rebate programs with us federal and state 
table of contents government agencies  may differ from those estimated 
on a quarterly basis  adjustments to our estimated liabilities for sales rebates and other incentive programs related to sales made in prior periods have not been material and have generally been less than of consolidated net sales 
an adjustment to our estimated liabilities of of consolidated net sales on a quarterly basis would result in an increase or decrease to net sales and earnings before income taxes of approximately million to million 
the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program and type of customer 
additionally  there is a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated liability and when we actually pay the liability 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated liabilities over several periods  which can result in a net increase to earnings or a net decrease to earnings in those periods 
material differences may result in the amount of revenue we recognize from product sales if the actual amount of rebates and incentives differ materially from the amounts estimated by management 
we recognize license fees as other income based on the facts and circumstances of each licensing agreement 
in general  we recognize income upon the signing of a license agreement that grants rights to products or technology to a third party if we have no further obligation to provide products or services to the third party after granting the license 
we defer income under license agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not culminated 
pensions we sponsor various pension plans in the united states and abroad in accordance with local laws and regulations 
our pension plans in the united states account for a large majority of our pension plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations 
in connection with these plans  we use certain actuarial assumptions to determine the plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations  the most significant of which are the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate 
our assumption for the expected long term rate of return on assets in our us pension plan for determining the net periodic benefit cost is for  which is the same rate used for and we determine  based upon recommendations from our pension plans investment advisors  the expected rate of return using a building block approach that considers diversification and rebalancing for a long term portfolio of invested assets 
our investment advisors study historical market returns and preserve long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income in a manner consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
they also evaluate market factors such as inflation and interest rates before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
the expected rate of return is applied to the market related value of plan assets 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in the rate of return on assets assumption would increase our expected us pre tax pension benefit cost by approximately million 
the discount rate used to calculate our us pension benefit obligations at december  is  which represents a percentage point decline from our december  rate of 
we determine the discount rate largely based upon an index of high quality fixed income investments us moody s aa corporate long bond yield average and a constructed hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments with maturities that mirror the pension benefit obligations at the plans measurement date 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in the discount rate assumption would increase our expected us pre tax pension benefit costs by approximately million and increase our us pension plans projected benefit obligations at december  by approximately million 
income taxes income taxes are determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate  which is generally less than the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of lower tax rates in certain non us jurisdictions and research and development  or r d  tax credits available in the united states 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the fiscal year as new information is obtained  which may affect the assumptions we use to estimate our annual effective tax rate  including factors such as our mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  reserves for tax contingen 
table of contents cies  utilization of r d tax credits and changes in or interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct operations 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities  along with net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
changes in the valuation allowances are a component of the estimated annual effective tax rate 
the decrease in the amount of valuation allowances at december  compared to december  is primarily due to a decrease in the valuation allowance due to a change in the estimate of the amount of realizable deferred tax assets in japan stemming from the recent licensing agreement with glaxosmithkline  partially offset by an increase in the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for certain capitalized intangible assets 
material differences in the estimated amount of valuation allowances may result in an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes if the actual amounts for valuation allowances required against deferred tax assets differ from the amounts estimated by us 
we have not provided for withholding and us taxes for the unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have currently reinvested these earnings indefinitely in such operations 
at december   we had approximately million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
tax expense would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability on such unremitted earnings 
upon remittance  certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes that are then available  subject to certain limitations  for use as credits against our us tax liability  if any 
during  in connection with the american jobs creation act of  or the act  we repatriated million in extraordinary dividends  as defined by the act  from unremitted foreign earnings that were previously considered permanently reinvested by certain non us subsidiaries 
the million amount of extraordinary dividends is the qualified amount above a million base amount determined based on our historical repatriation levels  as defined by the act 
the tax effect of the base amount of dividends is included in our estimated annual effective tax rate 
also during  we decided to repatriate approximately million in additional dividends above the base and extraordinary dividend amounts from prior and current years unremitted foreign earnings that were previously considered indefinitely reinvested 
based upon our repatriation activities during  we recorded estimated tax liabilities of million and million associated with the repatriation of the million in extraordinary dividends and the million in additional dividends above the base and extraordinary dividend amounts  respectively 
during  we reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions and related provision for income taxes by million primarily due to a change in estimate resulting from the resolution of several significant uncertain income tax audit issues  including transfer prices  the deductibility of transaction costs associated with the spin off of amo and intangible asset issues related to certain assets of allergan specialty therapeutics  inc and bardeen sciences company  llc  which we acquired in and  respectively 
the change in estimate relates to tax years currently under examination or not yet settled through expiry of the statute of limitations 
purchase price allocation the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
during  we acquired oculex pharmaceuticals  inc  or oculex  and bardeen sciences company  llc  or bardeen  for aggregate purchase prices of approximately million and million  
table of contents respectively 
the prices were allocated to identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values as of the respective transaction dates 
the oculex transaction was determined to be a business combination  while the bardeen transaction was considered to be an asset acquisition and not a business combination 
accordingly  we have provided pro forma financial information in our financial statements to reflect the effect of the oculex transaction on our historical operating results  but have not done so for the bardeen transaction 
see note  acquisitions  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report 
we determined that the assets acquired from oculex and bardeen consisted principally of incomplete in process research and development and that these projects had no alternative future uses in their current state 
we reached this conclusion based on discussions with our business development and research and development personnel  our review of long range product plans and our review of a valuation report prepared by an independent valuation specialist 
the valuation specialist s report reached a conclusion with regard to the fair value of the in process research and development assets in a manner consistent with principles prescribed in the aicpa practice aid  assets acquired in a business combination to be used in research and development activities a focus on software  electronic devices and pharmaceutical industries 
in connection with the acquisition of oculex  we determined that the assets acquired also included a proprietary technology drug delivery platform which was separately valued and capitalized as core technology 
we reached this conclusion based on our determination that the acquired technology had alternative future uses in its current state 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
operations headquartered in irvine  california  we are a technology driven  global health care company that develops and commercializes specialty pharmaceutical products for the ophthalmic  neurological  dermatological and other specialty markets 
we employ approximately  persons around the world 
we are an innovative leader in therapeutic and over the counter products that are sold in more than countries 
our principal markets are the united states  europe  latin america and asia pacific 
results of operations we currently operate our business on the basis of a single reportable segment specialty pharmaceuticals 
we produce a broad range of ophthalmic products for glaucoma therapy  ocular inflammation  infection  allergy and dry eye  skin care products for acne  psoriasis and other prescription and over the counter dermatological products  and botox for certain therapeutic and cosmetic indications 
we provide global marketing strategy teams to ensure development and execution of a consistent marketing strategy for our products in all geographic regions that share similar distribution channels and customers 
management evaluates its various global product portfolios on a revenue basis  which is presented below 
we also report sales performance using the non gaap financial measure of constant currency sales 
constant currency sales represent current period reported sales  adjusted for the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the corresponding period in the prior year 
we calculate the currency effect by comparing adjusted current period reported amounts  calculated using the monthly average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year  to the actual current period reported amounts 
we routinely evaluate our net sales performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of our sales 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the growth at constant currency rates will be higher or lower  respectively  than growth reported at actual exchange rates

table of contents dollar  mexican peso  the euro and other latin american currencies compared to the us dollar 
the million increase in net sales from the impact of foreign currency changes in compared to was due primarily to the strengthening of the euro  japanese yen  australian dollar  british pound  canadian dollar and brazilian real compared to the us dollar 
the million increase in net sales in compared to was primarily the result of increases in sales of our eye care pharmaceuticals  botox and skin care product lines  partially offset by a decrease in other non pharmaceutical sales 
eye care pharmaceuticals sales increased in compared to primarily because of strong growth in sales in the united states of restasis  our drug for the treatment of chronic dry eye disease  an increase in sales of our glaucoma drug lumigan  growth in sales of our alphagan franchise  primarily from our international operations and new product sales from combigan tm which is in the launch phase in canada and brazil  a strong increase in sales of eye drop products  primarily refresh  growth in sales of zymar  a newer anti infective  an increase in sales of elestat  our topical antihistamine used for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  and an increase in sales of acular ls  our newer non steroidal anti inflammatory 
this increase in sales was partially offset by a decrease in sales of ocuflox  our older generation anti infective that is experiencing generic competition in the united states  acular  our older generation anti inflammatory  and other glaucoma products 
we continue to believe that generic formulations of alphagan will have a negative impact on future net sales of our alphagan franchise 
we estimate the majority of the change in our eye care pharmaceutical sales was due to mix and volume changes  however  we increased the published list prices for certain eye care pharmaceutical products in the united states  ranging from three and one half percent to nine percent  effective february  we increased the published us list price for lumigan by seven percent  restasis by three and one half percent and alphagan p by five percent 
this increase in prices had a subsequent positive net effect on our us sales during compared to  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars 
we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels of our products at an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales 
at december   based on available external and internal information  we believe the amount of average us wholesaler inventories of our products was near the lower end of our stated policy levels 
botox sales increased in compared to primarily as a result of strong growth in demand in the united states and in international markets for both therapeutic and cosmetic uses 
based on internal information  we estimate that in botox therapeutic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox net sales and cosmetic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox net sales 
therapeutic and cosmetic net sales grew approximately and  respectively  in compared to effective january   we increased the published price for botox and botox cosmetic in the united states by approximately four percent  which we believe had a positive effect on our us sales growth in international botox sales also benefited from strong sales growth in europe  especially in germany  the united kingdom  spain  italy and the nordics  growth in sales in smaller distribution markets serviced by our european export sales group  and an increase in sales in canada  mexico  japan and australia 
we believe our worldwide market share for neuromodulators  including botox  is currently over 
skin care sales increased in compared to primarily due to higher sales of tazorac in the united states and new product sales generated from prevage tm antioxidant cream  which we launched in january net sales of tazorac  zorac and avage increased million  or  to million in compared to million in we increased the published us list price for tazorac by nine percent effective february  the million increase in net sales in compared to was primarily the result of an increase in sales of our eye care pharmaceuticals and botox product lines and an increase in other non pharmaceutical sales  partially offset by a decline in sales of our skin care products 
eye care pharmaceuticals sales increased in compared to primarily because of strong growth in sales of our glaucoma drug  lumigan  especially in the us and europe  growth in sales of restasis  our drug for the treatment of chronic dry eye 
table of contents disease  growth in sales of eye drop products  primarily refresh  an increase in sales of zymar  a newer anti infective  new product sales generated from elestat tm  our topical antihistamine used for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis that was launched in the united states in the first quarter of by our co promotion partner  inspire pharmaceuticals  inc  and an increase in sales of acular ls  our newer generation non steroidal anti inflammatory 
this increase in sales was partially offset by a decrease in sales of ocuflox and acular 
our alphagan franchise sales also decreased in compared to due to a general decline in us wholesaler demand for alphagan p  market share erosion from generic alphagan competition and an increase in the ratio of alphagan p sales subject to medicaid rebates in the united states 
we estimate the majority of the change in our eye care pharmaceutical sales was due to mix and volume changes  however  we increased the published list prices for certain eye care pharmaceutical products in the united states  ranging from zero to nine percent  effective january  we increased the published us list price for lumigan by five percent  and we left the price of restasis unchanged as of the same effective date 
on may   we increased the published us list price for restasis by five percent 
this increase in prices had a subsequent positive net effect on our us sales  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars 
during  we had a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels of our products at an amount between one to two months of our net sales 
at december   based on available external and internal information  we believe the amount of average us wholesaler inventories of our products was below our stated policy levels 
botox sales increased in compared to primarily as a result of strong growth in demand in the united states and international markets for both therapeutic and cosmetic uses 
based on internal information  we estimate that in botox therapeutic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox net sales and cosmetic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox net sales 
therapeutic and cosmetic net sales grew approximately and  respectively  in compared to effective december   we increased the published list price for botox and botox cosmetic in the united states by approximately seven percent  which we believe had a corresponding positive effect on our us sales growth in international botox sales also benefited from strong sales growth in europe  especially in france  spain and italy  as a result of the march launch in france of vistabel and the second quarter launches of vistabel in spain and certain scandinavian countries and vistabex tm in italy  as well as an increase in sales of botox in smaller distributor markets serviced by our european export sales group 
vistabel and vistabex tm are the trade names for botox cosmetic in europe and italy  respectively 
we believe our worldwide market share as of december  for neuromodulators  including botox  was over 
skin care sales declined in compared to primarily due to a decrease in sales of tazorac in the united states  where it is fda approved to treat both psoriasis and acne  and lower sales of avage  which we launched in the us in the first quarter of tazorac sales declined primarily due to excess in channel inventory at the end of  which we believe was principally at the retail pharmacy level 
this type of excess in channel inventory is difficult to detect from all sources of available market data 
we increased the published us list price for tazorac and avage by nine percent effective january  and by an additional five percent effective july  the percentage of us sales in as a percentage of total product net sales declined percentage points to compared to us sales of in  due primarily to a decrease in us other non pharmaceutical sales and an increase in international botox and eye care pharmaceutical sales  principally in europe  as a percentage of total product net sales 
the percentage of us sales in as a percentage of total product net sales declined percentage points to compared to us sales of in  due primarily to an increase in international eye care pharmaceutical sales  principally in europe and asia pacific  as a percentage of total product net sales  and a decrease in us sales of skin care products  partially offset by an increase in us sales of botox as a percentage of total product net sales

pharmaceutical sales increased by million in compared to this included a small increase in the percentage mix of botox net sales as a percentage of total net sales  which generally have a higher gross margin percentage than our other pharmaceutical product lines 
the increase in gross margin percentage in was partially offset by a small decrease in the gross margin percentage of our eye care pharmaceuticals  botox and skin care product lines 
the gross margin percentage for eye care pharmaceuticals declined slightly in compared to due primarily to an increase in the mix of international sales  which generally have a lower gross margin percentage than us sales  a higher ratio of us sales subject to sales rebates and other incentive programs and a negative impact from renegotiating our distribution services arrangements with our major us wholesalers during the small decline in gross margin percentage for our botox product line in compared to was due primarily to an increase in the mix of international sales  which generally have a lower gross margin percentage than us botox net sales  partially offset by the published price increase in january for botox and botox cosmetic in the united states 
the decline in gross margin percentage for skin care net sales in compared to is primarily due to new product sales of prevage tm  which have a lower gross margin percentage than our other prescription skin care products 
gross margin in dollars increased in compared to by million  or  as a result of the increase in net sales and the percentage point increase in gross margin percentage 
our gross margin percentage decreased in compared to primarily as a result of a decrease in gross margin percentage for eye care pharmaceuticals  the botox product line and skin care products  partially offset by an increase in gross margin percentage for contract manufacturing sales to amo and an increase in the mix of botox sales 
net sales of botox  which generally have a higher gross margin percentage than our other pharmaceutical product lines  represented a greater percentage of net sales compared to the gross margin percentage for eye care pharmaceuticals declined in compared to due to an increase in the percentage of net sales derived from international sales  which generally have a lower gross margin percentage than us sales  a higher ratio of us sales subject to sales rebates and other 
table of contents incentive programs  especially medicaid  and products with higher royalty rates payable to third parties 
the gross margin percentage for our botox product line experienced a small decline in compared to due primarily to lower gross margins in latin america resulting from less favorable foreign exchange transactions that affected cost of sales in compared to the gross margin percentage for contract manufacturing sales improved primarily due to an increase in us dollar denominated pricing allowed under the manufacturing and supply agreement with amo at the beginning of our fiscal year and certain annual contract manufacturing cost recoveries allowed under the manufacturing and supply agreement with amo 
research services margin we have historically recognized research service revenues and costs associated with various contract research and development arrangements 
research service revenues and costs declined in compared to as a result of our acquisition of bardeen in prior to the bardeen acquisition  we performed research and development services on compounds owned by bardeen pursuant to a research and development services agreement between us and bardeen 
since may   we have not been a party to any contract research and development arrangements similar to those previously reported

restructuring charges and transition duplicate operating expenses restructuring and streamlining of operations in japan on september  we entered into a long term agreement with glaxosmithkline gsk to develop and promote botox in japan and china 
under the terms of this agreement  we licensed to gsk all clinical development and commercial rights to botox in japan and china 
as a result of entering into this agreement  we initiated a plan in october to restructure and streamline our operations in japan 
the restructuring seeks to optimize the efficiencies of a third party license and distribution business model and align our operations in japan with our reduced role in research and development and commercialization activities under the agreement with gsk 
we have incurred  and anticipate that we will continue to incur  restructuring charges relating to one time termination benefits  contract termination costs and other asset related expenses in connection with the restructuring 
we currently estimate that the pre tax charges resulting from the restructuring will be between million and million 
we began to incur these amounts in the fourth quarter of and expect to continue to incur them up through and including the second quarter of substantially all of the pre tax charges are expected to be cash expenditures 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million

estimated charges include approximately million to million for contract and lease termination costs and asset write offs primarily for accelerated amortization related to leasehold improvements in facilities to be exited and a loss on the possible sale of our mougins facility 
we began to record these costs in the fourth quarter of and expect them to continue up through and including the second quarter of estimated transition related expenses include  among other things  legal  consulting  recruiting  information system implementation costs and taxes 
we also expect to incur duplicate operating expenses during the transition period to ensure that job knowledge and skills are properly transferred to new employees 
transition and duplicate operating expenses are currently estimated to total approximately million to million

during the third quarter of  we accelerated our amortization of debt issuance costs to a more conservative view  electing to amortize such costs related to our senior notes over the five year period from date of issuance in november to the first noteholder put date in november instead of over the year life of the senior notes

liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity by our ability to generate cash to fund our operations 
significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations  levels of accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and capital expenditures  the extent of our stock repurchase program  funds required for acquisitions  adequate credit facilities  and financial flexibility to attract long term capital on satisfactory terms 
historically  we have generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements

the increase in income taxes paid is primarily due to payments for the estimated us income tax liability for the repatriation of certain foreign earnings and advance payments in anticipation of income tax audit settlements 
we paid pension contributions of million in compared to million in the increase in the amount of pension contributions in compared to is primarily due to the negative impact of lower discount rates on the calculation of our accumulated benefit obligations as of september   the measurement date for our pension plans  and our desire to maintain plan assets in excess of accumulated benefit obligations in our funded pension plans 
in  we expect to pay pension contributions of between approximately million and million 
at december   we had consolidated unrecognized net actuarial losses of million which were included in our reported net prepaid benefit costs 
the unrecognized net actuarial losses resulted primarily from lower than expected investment returns on pension plan assets in and and decreases in the discount rates used to measure projected benefit obligations that occurred over the past five years 
assuming constant actuarial assumptions estimated as of our pension plans measurement date of september   we expect the amortization of these unrecognized net actuarial losses to increase our total pension costs by approximately million in compared to the amortization of approximately million of unrecognized net actuarial losses included in pension costs expensed in the amortization of unrecognized net actuarial losses included in pension costs in and was million and million  respectively 
the future amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial losses is not expected to materially affect future pension contribution requirements

we maintain an evergreen stock repurchase program 
our evergreen stock repurchase program authorizes us to repurchase our common stock for the primary purpose of funding our stock based benefit plans 
under the stock repurchase program  we may maintain up to million repurchased shares in our treasury account at any one time 
as of december   we held approximately million treasury shares under this program 
we are uncertain as to the level of stock repurchases  if any  to be made in the future 
in december  we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire inamed corporation  or inamed 
under the terms of the agreement  we have made a tender offer to acquire each outstanding common share of inamed for either in cash or of a share of our common stock  at the election of the holder 
elections of inamed stockholders with respect to the form of consideration they will receive are subject to proration such that we will pay of the aggregate consideration in cash and of the aggregate consideration in shares of our common stock 
we expect the cash portion of the purchase price to be approximately billion 
in order to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price  we executed a commitment letter pertaining to a billion bridge credit facility in december subsequent to the closing of the transaction to acquire inamed  we expect to replace the bridge financing with conventional long term financing 
as of december  there were no borrowings outstanding under the committed bridge credit facility 
at december   we had a committed long term credit facility  a committed foreign line of credit in japan  a commercial paper program  a medium term note program  an unused debt shelf registration statement that we may use for a new medium term note program and other issuances of debt securities  and various foreign bank facilities 
the committed long term credit facility allows for borrowings of up to million through may the committed foreign line of credit allows for borrowings of up to three billion japanese yen approximately million through july the commercial paper program also 
table of contents provides for up to million in borrowings 
the current medium term note program allows us to issue up to an additional million in registered notes on a non revolving basis 
the debt shelf registration statement provides for up to million in additional debt securities 
borrowings under the committed long term credit facility and medium term note program are subject to certain financial and operating covenants that include  among other provisions  maintaining minimum debt to capitalization ratios and minimum consolidated net worth 
certain covenants also limit subsidiary debt and restrict dividend payments 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  and had approximately billion available for dividends at december  as of december   we had no borrowings under our committed foreign line of credit or commercial paper program  million in borrowings under our committed long term credit facility  million in borrowings under various foreign bank loans and million in borrowings outstanding under the medium term note program 
on november   we issued zero coupon convertible senior notes due  or senior notes  in a private placement with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of million 
the senior notes  which were issued at a discount of million  are unsecured  accrue interest at annually and mature on november  the senior notes are convertible into shares of our common stock for each  principal amount at maturity if the closing price of our common stock exceeds certain levels  the credit ratings assigned to the senior notes are reduced below specified levels  or we call the senior notes for redemption  make specified distributions to our stockholders or become a party to certain consolidation  merger or binding share exchange agreements 
on july   we  together with wells fargo bank  as trustee  executed a supplemental indenture with respect to the senior notes to amend the redemption and conversion provisions to restrict our ability to issue common stock in lieu of cash to holders of the senior notes upon any redemption or conversion 
upon any redemption  we are now required to pay the entire redemption amount in cash 
in addition  upon any conversion  we will pay cash up to the accreted value of the senior notes converted and will have the option to pay any amounts due in excess of the accreted value in either cash or common stock 
the rights of the holders of the senior notes were not affected or limited by the supplemental indenture 
as of december   the conversion criteria were met  and holders may elect to convert the senior notes between january  and march  see note  convertible notes  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report for a description of the conversion features 
based on the terms of the senior notes  an assessment of the conversion criteria is performed each fiscal quarter  the result of which affects the holders ability to convert the senior notes in the immediately succeeding fiscal quarter 
if the conversion criteria are not met in our fiscal quarter ending march   the holders ability to convert the senior notes will be restricted until the conversion criteria are again met 
we include the dilutive effect from the assumed conversion of the senior notes  if any  in our computation of diluted earnings per share  assuming amounts due in excess of the accreted value will be paid in common stock 
as a sensitivity measure  a increase in the average price of our common stock would have resulted in an increase of approximately million shares of common stock to the total number of diluted shares used to compute diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  holders of the senior notes may require us to purchase the senior notes on any of the following dates at the following prices per senior note on november   per senior note on november   and per senior note on november  pursuant to the supplemental indenture  we are required to pay cash for any senior notes purchased by us on any of these three dates 
prior to november  we may redeem all or a portion of senior notes for cash in an amount equal to their accreted value only if the price of our common stock reaches certain thresholds for a specified period of time 
on or after november   we may redeem all or a portion of the senior notes for cash in an amount equal to their accreted value 
a significant amount of our existing cash and equivalents are held by non us subsidiaries 
we currently plan to use these funds in our operations outside the united states 
withholding and us taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have reinvested these earnings indefinitely in such operations 
as of december  we had approximately million in unremitted 
table of contents earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided

during  we repatriated a total of million in cash previously held by certain non us subsidiaries  primarily in connection with the american jobs creation act of see note  income taxes  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report for a discussion of our repatriation of certain unremitted foreign earnings and the estimated income tax costs of such repatriation activities 
our manufacturing and supply agreement with amo terminated as scheduled in june as of december   we recorded cumulative pre tax restructuring charges of million 
we expect to record an additional million to million in pre tax restructuring charges during the first three quarters of to complete the refurbishment of facilities previously used for contract manufacturing 
we currently estimate that the pre tax charges resulting from the restructuring or our european operations  including transition and duplicate operating expenses  will be between million and million and capital expenditures will be between million and million 
we began to incur these amounts in the first quarter of and expect to continue to incur them up through and including the second quarter of of the total amount of pre tax charges and capital expenditures  approximately million to million are expected to be cash expenditures 
during the year ended december   we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million and transition duplicate operating expenses of million related to the implementation of this restructuring of our european operations 
we expect to complete the additional restructuring activities by the end of the second quarter of we currently estimate that the pre tax charges resulting from the restructuring of our operations in japan will be between million and million  substantially all of which are expected to be cash expenditures 
during  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million  and we expect to continue to incur additional charges up through and including the second quarter of we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with borrowings available under our existing credit facilities and existing cash and equivalents  will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our expected obligations under the definitive merger agreement with inamed  working capital requirements  debt service and other cash needs over the next year 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services that we use 
the competitive and regulatory environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations approximately of our revenues in were derived from operations outside the united states  and a portion of our international cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars due to changing currency exchange rates 
we routinely monitor our transaction exposure to currency rates and implement certain economic hedging strategies to limit such exposure  as appropriate 
the net impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our sales was as follows a million increase in  a million increase in  and a million increase in the sales increase included million related to the euro  million related to the canadian dollar  million related to the australian dollar  million related to the brazilian real  million related to the mexican peso and million related to other latin american currencies

oculex pharmaceuticals  inc on november   we purchased all of the outstanding equity interests of oculex pharmaceuticals  inc  or oculex  a privately owned company  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired  including transaction costs of million and million in other assets related to oculex 
the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the consolidated statements of operations include the results of oculex beginning november  in conjunction with the acquisition  we recorded a charge to research and development for in process research and development expense of million during for an acquired in process research and development asset which we determined was not yet complete and had no alternative future uses in its current state 
this asset is oculex s lead investigational product  posurdex  which is a proprietary  bioerodable  sustained release implant that delivers dexamethasone to the targeted disease site at the back of the eye 
we have begun phase clinical trials for macular edema associated with diabetes and vein occlusions 
additionally  we determined that the assets acquired also included a proprietary technology drug delivery platform which had alternative future uses in its current state  which we separately valued and capitalized as core technology 
the core technology is a versatile bioerodable polymer drug delivery technology which can be used for sustained local delivery of compounds to the eye 
see note  acquisitions  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report for a discussion of the acquisition of oculex 
we believe the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
a summary of the net assets acquired follows in millions current assets property  plant and equipment capitalized intangible core technology straight line amortization over a year useful life in process research and development other non current assets  primarily deferred tax assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities during  we adjusted the fair value of certain net assets acquired by million  which resulted in a decrease in the amount of capitalized core technology and in process research and development of million and million  respectively 
the million decrease in in process research and development was included in research and development expenses in bardeen sciences company  llc on may   we completed an acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of bardeen sciences company  llc  or bardeen  from farallon pharma investors  llc  or farallon  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  including transaction costs of million and million in certain intangible contract based product marketing and other rights  net of cash acquired

table of contents project  tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of ocular neovascularization  a vision sparing project and a retinal disease project 
bardeen was formed in april upon our contribution of a portfolio of pharmaceutical compounds and research projects and the commitment of a million capital investment by farallon 
in return for our contribution of the portfolio  we received certain commercialization rights to market products developed from the compounds comprising the portfolio 
in addition  we acquired an option to purchase rights to any one product and a separate option to purchase all of the outstanding equity interests of bardeen at an option price based on the amount of research and development funds expended by bardeen on the portfolio and the time elapsed since the effective date of the option agreement 
we acquired bardeen upon the exercise of our option to purchase all the outstanding equity interests of bardeen at the option price 
neither we nor any of our officers or directors owned any interest in bardeen or farallon prior to the acquisition of the outstanding interests 
we determined that the assets acquired consisted entirely of incomplete in process research and development assets and that these assets had no alternative future uses in their current state 
the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as follows in millions intangible assets in process research and development accounts payable from the time of bardeen s formation until the acquisition date  we performed research and development on the compounds comprising the portfolio on bardeen s behalf pursuant to a research and development services agreement between us and bardeen under which all such activities were fully funded by bardeen and services were performed on a cost plus basis 
because the financial risk associated with the research and development was transferred to bardeen  we recognized revenues and related costs as services were performed under such agreements as required under sfas no 
 research and development arrangements 
these amounts are included in research service revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in research revenues and million in research costs under the research and development services agreement with bardeen 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item a of part iv of this report for activities relating to foreign currency risk management 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with our underlying foreign currency exposures  from an accounting and economic perspective 
however  given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  we cannot assure you that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial position 
we record current changes in the fair value of open foreign currency option contracts as unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments  net  and we record the gains and losses realized from settled option 
table of contents contracts in other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and are amortized to other  net over the life of the options 
we have recorded all unrealized and realized gains and losses from foreign currency forward contracts through other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and equivalents  interest expense on our debt as well as costs associated with foreign currency contracts 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt 
if the interest rates on the variable rate debt were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million

we have also entered into contractual indemnity agreements with each of our directors and certain 
table of contents officers pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify such directors and officers against any payments they are required to make as a result of a claim brought against such officer or director in such capacity  excluding claims i relating to the action or inaction of a director or officer that resulted in such director or officer gaining personal profit or advantage  ii for an accounting of profits made from the purchase or sale of our securities within the meaning of section b of the securities exchange act of or similar provisions of any state law or iii that are based upon or arise out of such director s or officer s knowingly fraudulent  deliberately dishonest or willful misconduct 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
however  we have purchased directors and officers liability insurance policies intended to reduce our monetary exposure and to enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we have not previously paid any material amounts to defend lawsuits or settle claims as a result of these indemnification provisions 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal 
we customarily agree in the ordinary course of our business to indemnification provisions in agreements with clinical trials investigators in our drug development programs  in sponsored research agreements with academic and not for profit institutions  in various comparable agreements involving parties performing services for us in the ordinary course of business  and in our real estate leases 
we also customarily agree to certain indemnification provisions in our drug discovery and development collaboration agreements 
with respect to our clinical trials and sponsored research agreements  these indemnification provisions typically apply to any claim asserted against the investigator or the investigator s institution relating to personal injury or property damage  violations of law or certain breaches of our contractual obligations arising out of the research or clinical testing of our compounds or drug candidates 
with respect to lease agreements  the indemnification provisions typically apply to claims asserted against the landlord relating to personal injury or property damage caused by us  to violations of law by us or to certain breaches of our contractual obligations 
the indemnification provisions appearing in our collaboration agreements are similar  but in addition provide some limited indemnification for the collaborator in the event of third party claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights 
in each of the above cases  the term of these indemnification provisions generally survives the termination of the agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments that we could be required to make under these provisions is generally unlimited 
we have purchased insurance policies covering personal injury  property damage and general liability intended to reduce our exposure for indemnification and to enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we have not previously paid any material amounts to defend lawsuits or settle claims as a result of these indemnification provisions 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these indemnification arrangements is minimal 
foreign currency risk overall  we are a net recipient of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated sales  gross margins or operating expenses as expressed in us dollars 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on our core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  we enter into contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
we use foreign currency option contracts  which provide for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies to offset foreign currency exposures expected to arise in the normal course of our business 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures 
the principal currencies subject to this process are the canadian dollar  mexican peso  australian dollar  brazilian real  euro  japanese yen and the uk pound
