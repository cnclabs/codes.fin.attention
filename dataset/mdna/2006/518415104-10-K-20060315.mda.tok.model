item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
lattice semiconductor corporation designs  develops and markets high performance programmable logic products and related software 
programmable logic products are widely used semiconductor components that can be configured by the end customer as specific logic circuits  and thus enable shorter design cycle times and reduced development costs 
within this market there are two groups of products programmable logic devices plds and field programmable gate arrays fpgas each representing a distinct silicon architectural approach 
products based on the two alternative programmable logic architectures are generally optimal for different types of logic functions  although many logic functions can be implemented using either architecture 
we believe that a substantial portion of programmable logic customers utilize both pld and fpga architectures 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the communications  computing  industrial  consumer  automotive  medical and military markets 
overview of revenue for our business in decreased to million as compared to million in due to the decline in our mainstream and mature products  which was partially offset by growth of our new products 
additionally  there was a decline in business conditions beginning in the third quarter of attributable to general weakening in the communications end market  which began to improve at a slow pace in the first quarter of and continued to improve slowly through the end of revenue for increased as compared to million in due to growth of our new products  which was partially offset by a decline in revenues from mature products 
among other things  future revenue growth is dependent on overall economic conditions for our industry and market acceptance of our new fpga products 
our gross margin in was for the year as compared to in and  primarily attributable to lower production yields and average selling prices on our new products and an inventory write down 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded a charge to cost of sales related to the initiation of a last time buy program to obsolete certain mature products 
gross margin may be adversely affected in the future due to product mix shifts  competitive pricing pressure  manufacturing yield issues and wafer and assembly pricing 
research and development expenses increased to million of revenue in compared to million of revenue in and million of revenue in research and development spending is predominantly related to the continued development of next generation fpga products 
although we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development  we have taken steps to streamline and consolidate our research and development process  the impact of which is reflected in restructuring charges for the fourth quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million of revenue in as compared to million of revenue in and million of revenue in expenses increased in both and primarily due to legal expenses related to the pending shareholder class action suit  the securities and exchange commission s ongoing informal inquiry  and the settled shareholder derivative suit  slc investigation and audit committee investigation 
legal expenses related to these matters resulted in a total charge of million during compared to million in these increases are partially offset by decreases primarily in consulting services  sales related expenses and other miscellaneous items 
to the extent our revenue continues to grow  we expect that there will be a less than proportionate increase in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
amortization of intangible assets decreased significantly to million in as compared to million in and million in  as amortization of intangible assets acquired in the vantis acquisition was completed in the june quarter 
amortization for the remaining intangible assets is expected to be million in restructuring charges of million in include million of severance related costs  million of lease related costs and million of other costs  including a million write off of an intellectual property license 
the restructuring plan was initiated during the fourth quarter of and was substantially complete by december  we currently estimate that the restructuring will result in a reduction in our operating expenses  effective in the first quarter of  of an estimated million to million per quarter 
remaining costs to complete the restructuring will be recorded in future periods as incurred and are not expected to be significant 
although the restructuring was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of  we cannot be certain as to the actual amount of any remaining restructuring charges or the timing of their recognition for financial reporting purposes 
the benefits of the restructuring may not materialize for a number of reasons  including the possibility that we may incur unanticipated costs in closing facilities or consolidating our operations 
in addition  we expect that a portion of the estimated reduction in our operating expenses resulting from the restructuring will be offset by other operating expenses  including stock compensation expense that we will recognize beginning in the first quarter of as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
if we are unsuccessful in realizing the benefits of our restructuring plan  we may experience disruptions in our operations and higher ongoing costs  which may adversely affect our operating results 
interest and other income expense  net of million in includes million of interest income from marketable securities and cash equivalents  and million of gains from the sale of umc common stock and extinguishment of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  partially offset by amortization of issuance costs of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  the increase in interest and other income expense  net from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to higher interest yields on cash and investment balances combined with additional gains on extinguishment of our convertible notes 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to gains on the sale of umc common stock and extinguishment of our convertible notes 
to the extent market conditions allow  we may make similar extinguishments of our convertible notes and sales of umc common stock in future quarters 
we are not currently paying federal or state income taxes and do not expect to pay such taxes in due to the tax benefit caused by the restructuring loss resulting from closure of the united kingdom research and development center  net foreign income tax was negligible 
in  we expect to pay foreign income taxes at levels comparable to and prior years

revenue was million in  a decrease of from revenue was million in  an increase of over revenue of million 
the composition of our revenue by product segment for the years presented was as follows years ended december  fpga pld prior to the acquisition of agere fpga  we had no revenue from fpga products 
the decrease in revenue in as compared to was primarily due to a decline in our mainstream and mature products  which declined and  respectively  for the year and more than offset revenue growth from new products which increased for the same time period 
further  our sales were affected by a decline in business conditions beginning in the third quarter of attributable to general weakening in the communications end market which began to improve at a slow pace in the first quarter of and continued to improve slowly through the end of during  our revenue was adversely affected by the business downturn experienced by the semiconductor and programmable logic markets that began in  offset in part by a general business recovery experienced late in revenue from export sales as a percentage of total revenue was approximately for  for and for we expect export sales to continue to represent a significant portion of revenue 
our sales by geographic region were as follows in thousands years ended december  united states export sales europe asia pacific other than japan and china japan china other total revenue from export sales total revenue during  total units sold decreased by four percent while overall average selling prices declined by two percent when compared to the decrease in units sold is predominantly attributable to lower sales of mainstream and mature products due to reduced end market demand while the decrease in average selling prices is primarily due to product mix 
average selling prices of mainstream products increased by five percent in compared to while units sold decreased by 
from a product line viewpoint  in there was a increase in fpga units sold  partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices when compared to for pld products in  units sold decreased four percent and average selling prices decreased by one percent when compared to during  total units sold increased by and average selling prices declined by three percent when compared to in  units sold increased due to sales of new products while average selling prices were adversely impacted by lower selling prices of mature products 
our ability to maintain or increase the level of our average selling price is dependent on the continued development  introduction and market acceptance of new products 
see factors affecting future results 
gross margin 
our gross margin percentage was for and for and changes in the gross margin percentage reflect revenue growth in new products  which typically carry an initial lower gross margin  and a decline in revenue from mature products  which typically carry a higher gross margin 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of we initiated a last time buy program to obsolete certain mature products resulting in a charge to cost of sales to write down excess inventory 
research and development 
research and development expense was million for compared to million for and million for research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  masks  prototype wafers  third party design automation software  assembly tooling and qualification expenses 
the increases in and when compared to the prior year resulted primarily from mask and engineering wafer costs for the completion of new products  and to a lesser extent  personnel related costs 
we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential in order to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
as we continue to move to more advanced process technologies such as nm and beyond  mask costs are becoming increasingly more expensive and will therefore increasingly represent a greater proportion of total research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in  million in and million in the increase compared to was primarily due to legal expenses related to the pending shareholder class action suit  the securities and exchange commission s ongoing informal inquiry  and the settled shareholder derivative suit  slc investigation and audit committee investigation 
legal expenses related to these matters resulted in a total charge of million during and million in these increases are partially offset by decreases primarily in consulting services  sales related expenses and other miscellaneous items 
the increase compared to was primarily due to the increase in sales commissions and marketing expenses related to new products and increased professional and legal fees related to initial compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets is related to our acquisitions  discussed above  our vantis acquisition and our acquisition of integrated intellectual property  inc ip 
amortization expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in amortization expense in was attributable to completion of amortization of intangible assets from the vantis and agere acquisitions during the decrease in amortization expense in was attributable to intangible assets from the vantis acquisition which were fully amortized during restructuring charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to our plan to consolidate operations  streamline engineering functions and lower operating expenses 
the restructuring encompassed three major components streamlining of our research and development sites  a voluntary separation program for certain employees and an organizational consolidation within our largest design center 
these actions did not impact our product direction or product roll out strategy  which remain unchanged 
the restructuring charge primarily relates to separation packages and costs to vacate space under long term lease arrangements 
the plan included reduction of our work force by approximately during the fourth quarter of the positions affected were mainly related to research and development activities 
lease costs represent ongoing contractual lease payments  less estimated proceeds from subleasing activities  and the remaining book value of leasehold improvements for various buildings located in texas  colorado  utah and the united kingdom 
leasehold improvements were charged to restructuring when the premises were vacated  and lease costs will be charged against the restructuring accrual on a monthly basis until the lease agreements expire  or otherwise terminate 
in addition  we recorded a charge of million to write off an intellectual property license related to these restructuring activities 
total cash outlays under the restructuring plan are expected to be million  of which million was paid during the fourth quarter of  and million was paid in the first quarter of primarily related to severance payments 
the current liability estimates accrued for abandoned leases  net of estimated sublease payments  will be paid over their respective lease terms through  or earlier if termination of leases is negotiated 
other remaining cash expenditures for relocating employees and transferring equipment from vacated buildings are expected to be paid during the first quarter of the restructuring plan was substantially complete as of december  remaining costs to complete the restructuring will be recorded in future periods as incurred and are not expected to be significant 
the following table displays the current estimate for each major type of cost associated with the restructuring in thousands initial accrual paid or settled accrual at severance and related costs lease loss reserve other balance as of december  included in the above amounts are disposals of leasehold improvements and fixed assets totaling million and million  respectively 
the above restructuring charges are based on estimates that are subject to change 
lease charges could change based on our ability to either generate sublease income or terminate lease obligations at the amounts estimated  and is dependent upon lease market conditions at the time we negotiate the potential arrangements 
variance from these estimates could alter our ability to achieve anticipated expense reductions in the planned timeframe and modify our expected cash outflows and working capital 
interest income 
interest income was million in  million in and million in the increase in when compared to is primarily attributable to higher interest rates 
the increase in when compared to was attributable to higher balances and interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense was insignificant in and  and was million in substantially all interest expense resulted from the debt issued to partially fund our vantis acquisition 
the decrease in and when compared to is due to the extinguishment of our remaining convertible subordinated notes in july see note to our consolidated financial statements 
other income  net 
other income  net  was million in  million in and million in for  other income  net  consists of a million gain on sale of umc common stock and a million gain on extinguishment of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july   net of million amortization of convertible note issuance costs and other costs 
for  other income  net  consists of a million gain on sale of umc common stock and a million gain on extinguishment of zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july   net of million amortization of convertible note issuance costs and other costs 
for  other income  net  consists of million of gain recorded on the extinguishment of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july   substantially offset by the million call premium associated with the extinguishment of our convertible subordinated notes see note to our consolidated financial statements 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the and tax provisions are related to adjustments to reserves and to income taxes on our foreign subsidiaries primarily engaged in selling and research and development activities 
the tax benefit in is primarily a result of releasing million of tax reserves as the related statute of limitations expired and a million refund of federal income taxes see note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a description of our critical accounting policies follows 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classification of assets  such as accounts receivable  inventory and deferred income taxes and liabilities  such as accrued liabilities  income taxes and deferred income  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenue from direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations 
certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements providing price protection and right of return on certain allowed and agreed upon unsold merchandise 
revenue and costs relating to such distributor sales are deferred until the product is sold by the distributor and related revenue and costs are then reflected in income 
our method of revenue recognition for deferred distributor sales is based on certain assumptions including our average collection experience compared to resale reported by the distributors 
to the extent actual results differ from these assumptions  revenue will change accordingly 
deferred income 
in determining the balance in the deferred income account  we make estimates of salable and returnable inventory at certain distributors and we make estimates similar to those used to value inventory on hand to value inventory at these distributors 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  the balances of reported deferred income  revenue and cost of products sold will change accordingly 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market on a quarterly basis 
in addition  we write down unproven  excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value 
to value our inventory  we make a number of estimates and assumptions including future price declines and forecasted demand for our products 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates and assumptions  the balances of reported inventory and cost of products sold will change accordingly 
long lived assets 
we account for our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets  which requires us to review the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount 
a loss is recorded if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows 
intangible assets are generally being amortized over five years  and fifteen years for income tax purposes  on a straight line basis 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges are recognized and recorded at fair value as incurred in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
restructuring costs include severance and other costs related to employee terminations  facility costs related to abandonment of various leased research and development sites  and other costs associated with the exit and disposal activities 
as changes to these estimates occur in subsequent periods resulting from timing changes or other factors  we will record either an increase or decrease to the estimated costs previously recorded 
it is possible that actual costs incurred in the future will differ from the amounts recorded as of december  accounting for income taxes 
to report income tax expense related to operating results  we record current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in our balance sheet 
in determining the value of our deferred tax assets  we make estimates of future taxable income 
as of december   and  we have recorded full valuation allowances for all of our us deferred tax assets due to uncertainties regarding their realization 
as of december   we have recorded a partial valuation allowance against our foreign deferred tax assets 
we had no foreign deferred tax assets at december  or in addition  in determining the value of income tax liabilities we make estimates of the results of future examinations of our income tax returns by taxing authorities 
we have adequately provided in our financial statements for additional taxes that we estimate may result from these examinations 
if these amounts provided prove to be more than what is necessary  the reversal of the reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which we determine the liability is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements in and thereafter is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
the amount of stock based compensation expense in and thereafter will be reduced for estimated forfeitures based on historical experience 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we will evaluate the assumptions used to value stock awards on a periodic basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ from what we have recorded in the past 
we have estimated that stock based compensation expense under sfas no 
r for the first quarter of will be approximately million 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact on our financial statements for the remainder of fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and marketable securities  which was million less than the balance of million at december  this decrease in cash and marketable securities was primarily due to a million payment to fujitsu in january pursuant to the fujitsu app agreement entered into in september working capital decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was the result of million paid to extinguish zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july   capital expenditures of million during and the remainder primarily related to restructuring accrued charges resulting from operations 
during we used million of cash and cash equivalents in our operations  compared to million generated in cash flow from operating activities for the years ended december  and each included a million payment to fujitsu pursuant to the fujitsu app agreement 
accounts receivable increased million at december  compared to december  due to higher billings in the later portion of the fourth quarter of as compared to the similar period in combined with higher revenues in the december quarter compared to the december quarter 
inventories decreased million  or  at december  compared to december  primarily due to levels of shipments being greater than procurements 
in the fourth quarter of we initiated a last time buy program to obsolete certain mature products resulting in an inventory write down of million 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by million at december  as compared to december   which is related to an increase in anticipated receipt of prepaid wafers in the subsequent twelve month period see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the current portion of equity securities available for sale decreased from million at december  to million at december  the decrease of million is almost entirely due to the sale of umc common stock during the current year 
the balance of these securities represents the portion of our investment in umc that is available for sale during without restriction see note to our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment  less accumulated depreciation  decreased by million at december  as compared to december  and decreased by million in as compared to the balance in the prior year due to depreciation expense being greater than expenditures for capital equipment 
capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we expect to spend million to million on capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending december  net intangible assets decreased by million and million in and as compared to the balances of the prior years  respectively  which is attributable to amortization of these assets 
foundry investments  advances and other assets decreased by approximately million at december  compared to december  primarily due to receipt of million in wafers from seiko epson pursuant to the advance payment production agreement  under which our investment is to be repaid with semiconductor wafers over a multi year period 
further  we wrote off an intellectual property license of million  as discussed in our charges for restructuring 
foundry investments  advances and other assets increased by approximately million at december  as compared to the balance of the prior year 
this was primarily due to recording of a million advance to fujitsu for future wafer supply see note to our consolidated financial statements  partially offset by a decline in our umc investment due to the sale of million of shares and a million decline in the market price of remaining shares of umc common stock 
as of december   we owned million shares of umc common stock 
future sales of these shares may result in a reduction in wafer capacity guaranteed to us by umc 
during  we sold approximately million shares of umc common stock for approximately million in cash  resulting in a gain of million 
during  we sold million shares of our umc common stock for approximately million in cash  resulting in a gain of approximately million 
in the future  we may choose to liquidate additional umc common stock 
in we entered into an advance payment production agreement with seiko epson and epson electronics america  inc eea  which was subsequently amended in and march under this agreement we advanced million to seiko epson to finance construction of an eight inch sub micron semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility 
the advance is to be repaid with semiconductor wafers over a multi year period 
no interest income is recorded 
the agreement calls for wafers to be supplied by seiko epson through eea pursuant to purchase agreements with eea 
cumulatively  million of these payments have been repaid to us in the form of semiconductor wafers 
we currently estimate that approximately million of the outstanding advances will be repaid with semiconductor wafers during fiscal and are thus reflected as part of prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are not obligated to make additional payments under this agreement 
on june   we issued million in zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  no interest will accrue or be payable related to these notes 
holders of these notes may convert the notes into shares of our common stock at any time before the close of business on the date of their maturity  unless the notes have been previously redeemed or repurchased  if the price of our common stock issuable upon conversion of a note reaches a specified threshold  the notes are called for redemption  if we request a redemption  or make a distribution to common stockholders that is dilutive to note holders or if we become a party to a merger or consolidation or sale of substantially all of our assets or the trading price of the notes falls below certain thresholds 
the conversion price is approximately per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
on or after july   we have the option to redeem all or a portion of the notes that have not been previously repurchased or converted at of the principal amount of the notes 
on july   holders have the option to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes in cash at of the principal amount of the notes 
holders also have the right  subject to certain conditions  to require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes at of the principal amount of the notes 
generally  a fundamental change is an occurrence resulting in substantially all of our common stock being converted into common stock which is not listed on a united states stock exchange or nasdaq 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our senior indebtedness  and are structurally subordinated as to the revenues and assets of our subsidiaries to all debt and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
at december   we had no senior indebtedness and our subsidiaries had approximately million of debt and other liabilities outstanding 
issuance costs relative to these convertible notes are included in foundry investments  advances and other assets and aggregated approximately million and are being amortized to expense over the lives of the notes 
accumulated amortization of these issuance costs was approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
in october  our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to million of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  during  we extinguished million of these notes for approximately million in cash and recognized a net gain of approximately million after writing off approximately million of unamortized issuance costs 
during  we extinguished approximately million of these notes for approximately million in cash and recognized a net gain of approximately million after writing off approximately million of unamortized issuance costs 
in the first quarter of  we extinguished million of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  for million and net of million amortization of issuance costs 
the extinguishment resulted in a gain of million which will be included in interest and other income expense for the march  quarter 
in the future we may choose to extinguish additional notes 
on july   we extinguished for cash all of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due in  originally issued in october  plus accrued interest 
total cash paid at extinguishment approximated million  including par value of million  accrued interest of approximately million and a call premium of of the outstanding notes  or approximately million 
this call premium  plus unamortized issuance costs of approximately million as of the extinguishment date  was recorded as other expense in the quarter ended september  on september   we entered into an advance payment and purchase agreement the fujitsu app agreement with fujitsu limited fujitsu  pursuant to which we will advance million to fujitsu in support of the development and construction of a new mm wafer fabrication facility in mie  japan 
the initial two payments of million each were made in october and january  with the remaining payments to be made in two stages upon the achievement of certain milestones 
we currently anticipate that the achievement of these milestones will occur in the second and third quarters of our million advance will be credited against the purchase price of mm wafers received from the new wafer fabrication facility 
the fujitsu app agreement will continue until the full amount of the advance payment has been returned to us in the form of wafers or other repayment  subject to the right of either party to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events 
we may request a refund of the unused amount of the advance payment if we have not used all of our wafer credits by december  the repayment obligation of fujitsu is unsecured 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations at december  in thousands fiscal year operating leases purchase order obligations advance payment and purchase agreement zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due july  later years certain of our facilities and equipment are leased under operating leases  which expire at various times through rental expense under the operating leases was approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
included in the above amounts for operating leases are the properties which were vacated as part of our restructuring plan 
represents obligations to make payments upon completion of milestones presently estimated to occur by the second and third quarters of included in the above operating lease amounts are certain properties which are currently subleased through april a portion of this sublease income is payable to the property owner 
for fiscal  future minimum sublease receipts net of such payments  based on agreements in place at december   total million 
in december  our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to five million shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
there were no repurchases of common stock in  or congress adopted the american jobs creation act of which among other things provides companies with foreign subsidiaries the opportunity to repatriate earnings of such subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate 
presently we have substantial tax loss carryforwards which could be used to offset tax liabilities arising from repatriation of foreign subsidiary earnings 
we are not planning to repatriate earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
we believe that our existing liquid resources and expected cash generated from operations combined with our ability to borrow additional funds will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for the next months 
we may in the future seek new or additional sources of funding 
in addition  in order to secure additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including joint ventures  equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on recognition and measurement guidance previously discussed under eitf the consensus clarifies the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the recognition and measurement guidance for which the consensus was reached in the march meeting was to be applied to other than temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after june  in september  the fasb issued a final fasb staff position that delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition guidance for all investments within the scope of eitf the consensus reached in march also provided for certain disclosure requirements associated with cost method investments which was effective for fiscal years ending after june  in july  the fasb decided to issue proposed fsp eitf a  implementation guidance for the application of paragraph of eitf issue no 
 as final 
the final fsp retitled fsp fas supersedes eitf and is effective for other than temporary impairment analyses conducted in periods beginning after december  during  management will evaluate the effect of adopting the recognition and measurement guidance 
in december  the fasb issued a statement entitled  share based payment a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation  that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
the statement eliminates the ability to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method currently used by the company and generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized as expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the effective date of the standard is for fiscal years beginning after june  accordingly  we have adopted the standard beginning january under sfas no 
r  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
we are applying the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which is being amortized over the vesting period 
in addition  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
in march  which includes interpretive guidance for the initial implementation of sfas no 
r 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a significant and adverse impact on our consolidated statement of operations  as we are required to expense the fair value of our stock option grants and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
however  it will have no impact on our cash flow 
we have estimated that stock based compensation expense under sfas no 
r for the first quarter of will be approximately million 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact on our consolidated financial statements for the remainder of fiscal in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purpose 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and december  our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of million and million  respectively 
as with all fixed income instruments  these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december  and december   the decline in the fair value of our portfolio would not be material 
furthermore  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize such an adverse impact in our results from operations or statement of cash flows 
the fair market value of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes the notes due july   is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the notes and the fair market value of the company s common stock 
generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the notes but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
as of december  and  the fair value of the notes was approximately million and million  respectively based on quoted market prices 
we have international subsidiary and branch operations 
additionally  we sell products to japanese customers denominated in yen 
we therefore are subject to foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
to minimize foreign exchange risk related to yen based net assets on our consolidated balance sheet  on august   we entered into an agreement with a bank under the terms of which we can borrow up to million in japanese yen in a revolving line of credit arrangement
