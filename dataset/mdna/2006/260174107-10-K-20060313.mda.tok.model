critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those the company considers critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
currently  the company maintains a valuation allowance  which increased by  in to  on deferred tax assets related to certain state net operating loss carry forwards 
the company has considered ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize all or a portion of these deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its remaining deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over estimated useful lives ranging from to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment and up to years for facilities 
these estimates require assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the company performs reviews for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
generally  fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows

table of contents factors that may affect operating results  forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  relating to our financial condition  profitability  liquidity  resources  business outlook  proposed acquisitions  market forces  corporate strategies  consumer preferences  contractual commitments  legal matters  capital requirements and other matters 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements 
to comply with the terms of the safe harbor  we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ substantially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward looking statements 
when words and expressions such as believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  plans  intends  objectives  goals  aims  projects  forecasts  possible  seeks  may  could  should  might  likely  enable or similar words or expressions are used in this document  as well as statements containing phrases such as in our view  there can be no assurance  although no assurance can be given or there is no way to anticipate with certainty  forward looking statements are being made 
various risks and uncertainties may affect the operation  performance  development and results of our business and could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in our forward looking statements  including the following factors stability and viability of sanctioning bodies  success of or changes in our growth strategies  development and potential acquisition of new facilities  anticipated trends in the motorsports industry  patron demographics  obtaining favorable contracts relative to sponsorships  event sanctions and broadcast rights  relationships with sanctioning bodies  sponsors  broadcast media  drivers and teams  general market and economic conditions  including consumer and corporate spending sentiment  ability to finance future business requirements  the availability of adequate levels of insurance  ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and businesses  management retention and development  changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations  including environmental regulations  the effect of weather conditions on outdoor event attendance  military or other government actions  availability of air travel  and national or local catastrophic events 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements as a result of future developments  events or conditions 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to 
table of contents predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  stockholders should not overly rely or attach undue weight to our forward looking statements as an indication of our actual future results 
our relationships with and the success of various sanctioning bodies is vital to our success in motorsports our continued success in motorsports is dependent upon the success of various governing bodies of motorsports that sanction national racing events and our ability to secure favorable contracts with and maintain a good working relationship with these sanctioning bodies  including nascar  irl and nhra 
sanctioning bodies regularly issue and award sanctioned events and their issuance depends  in large part  on maintaining good working relationships with the sanctioning bodies 
many events are sanctioned on an annual basis with no contractual obligation to renew  including our agreements with nascar 
by awarding a sanctioned event or a series of sanctioned events  the sanctioning bodies do not warrant  nor are they responsible for  the financial success of any sanctioned event 
our inability to obtain additional sanctioned events in the future and to maintain sanction agreements at current levels would likely result in lower than anticipated revenues from admissions  broadcast rights  sponsorships  hospitality  concessions and merchandise  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from the broadcast revenues received through the arrangements that nascar has made with various broadcast media  many of which expire in the success of a particular sanctioning body in attracting drivers and teams  signing series sponsors and negotiating favorable television and or radio broadcast rights is largely outside of our control 
as our success depends on the success of each event or series that we are promoting  a material adverse effect on a sanctioning body  such as the loss or defection of top drivers  the loss of significant series sponsors  or the failure to obtain favorable broadcast coverage or to properly advertise the event or series could result in a reduction in our revenues from admissions  luxury suite rentals  sponsorships  hospitality  concessions and merchandise  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on sponsorship contracts to generate revenues we receive a substantial portion of our annual revenues from sponsorship agreements  including the sponsorship of our various events and our permanent venues  such as title  official product and promotional partner sponsorships  billboards  signage and skyboxes 
loss of our title sponsors or other major sponsorship agreements or failure to secure such sponsorship agreements in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
of the fifteen major events we have scheduled for  we currently have secured title sponsors for ten events 
we are in negotiations with various potential sponsors for these events  including one of our nascar nextel cup series events at dover international speedway 
our motorsports events face intense competition for attendance  television viewership and sponsorship we compete with other auto speedways for the patronage of motor racing spectators as well as for promotions and sponsorships 
moreover  racing events sanctioned by different organizations are often held on the same dates at different tracks 
the quality of the competition  type of racing event  caliber of the event  sight lines  ticket pricing  location and customer conveniences  among other things  distinguish the motorsports facilities 
in addition  all of our events compete with other sports and recreational events scheduled on the same dates 
as a result  our revenues and operations are affected not only by our ability to compete in the motorsports promotion market  but also by the availability of alternative spectator sports events  forms of entertainment and changing consumer preferences 
the sales tax and property tax revenues to service the revenue bonds for infrastructure improvements at nashville may be inadequate in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in revenue bonds to build local infrastructure improvements which benefit the operation of nashville superspeedway  of which  was outstanding on december  debt service on the bonds is payable solely from sales taxes and incremental property taxes generated from the facility 
as of december  and   and 
table of contents  respectively  was available in the sales and incremental property tax fund maintained by the sports authority to pay the remaining principal and interest due under the bonds 
during the year ended december    was paid by the company into the sales and incremental property tax fund and  was deducted from the fund for principal and interest payments and to reimburse the company for fees associated with maintaining the letter of credit 
these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
in the event the sales taxes and incremental property taxes are insufficient to cover the payment of principal and interest on the bonds  the company would become responsible for the difference 
in the event the company was unable to make the payments  they would be made under a  irrevocable direct pay letter of credit issued by the existing bank group pursuant to a reimbursement and security agreement under which we have agreed to reimburse the banks for drawings made under the letter of credit 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the seasonality of our motorsports events increases the variability of quarterly earnings our business has been  and is expected to remain  seasonal given that it depends on our outdoor events for a substantial portion of revenues 
we derive a substantial portion of our motorsports revenues from admissions and event related revenue attributable to six nascar sanctioned events at dover  delaware which are currently held in june and september 
this has been offset to some degree by our other motorsports events  but quarterly earnings will vary 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover catastrophic incidents we maintain insurance policies that provide coverage within limits that are sufficient  in the opinion of management  to protect us from material financial loss incurred in the ordinary course of business 
we also purchase special event insurance for motorsports events to protect against race related liability 
however  there can be no assurance that this insurance will be adequate at all times and in all circumstances 
if we are held liable for damages beyond the scope of our insurance coverage  including punitive damages  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
bad weather can have an adverse financial impact on our motorsports events we sponsor and promote outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things at these events 
although we sell many tickets well in advance of the outdoor events and these tickets are issued on a non refundable basis  poor weather conditions may adversely affect additional ticket sales and concessions and souvenir sales  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently maintain weather related insurance for major events 
due to the importance of clear visibility and safe driving conditions to motorsports racing events  outdoor racing events may be significantly affected by weather patterns and seasonal weather changes 
any unanticipated weather changes could impact our ability to stage events 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
postponement and or cancellation of major motorsports events could adversely affect us if one of our events is postponed because of weather or other reasons such as  for example  the general postponement of all major sporting events in this country following the september  terrorism attacks  we could incur increased expenses associated with conducting the rescheduled event  as well as possible decreased revenues from tickets  food  drinks and merchandise at the rescheduled event 
if such an event is cancelled  we could incur the expenses associated with preparing to conduct the event as well as losing the revenues  including live broadcast revenues associated with the event 
if a cancelled event is part of the nascar nextel cup series or nascar busch series  we could experience a reduction in the amount of money received from television revenues for all of our nascar sanctioned events in the series that experienced the cancellation 
this would occur if  as a result of the cancellation  and without regard to whether the cancelled event was scheduled for one of our facilities  nascar experienced a reduction in broadcast revenues greater than the amount scheduled to be paid to the promoter of the cancelled event 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
at december   there was  outstanding under the company s revolving credit agreement 
the credit agreement bears interest at the company s option  upon libor plus a margin that varies between and basis points depending on the leverage ratio or the base rate the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus plus a margin that varies between and basis points depending on the leverage ratio 
therefore  the company is subject to interest rate risk on the variable component of the interest rate 
historically  the company managed its mix of fixed and variable rate debt by structuring the terms of its debt agreements 
effective october   the company entered into a  interest rate swap agreement effectively converting this portion of the outstanding variable rate borrowings under the revolving credit agreement to fixed rate securities  thereby hedging against the impact of potential interest rate changes 
under this agreement  the company will pay a fixed interest rate of 
in return  the issuing lender will refund to the company the variable rate interest paid to the bank group under its revolving credit agreement on the same notional principal amount  excluding the margin that varies between and basis points depending on the leverage ratio 
the notional amount of the swap agreement decreases to  on november   to  on november  and to  on november  the agreement terminates on november  as of december   the interest rate swap had no value 
an increase in interest rates of one percent would result in the interest rate swap having a value of approximately  at december  a change in interest rates will have no impact on the interest expense associated with the  of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement that are subject to the interest rate swap agreement 
a change in interest rates of one percent on the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement at december  not subject to the interest rate swap would cause a change in total annual interest costs of  the borrowings under the company s revolving credit agreement bear interest at the variable rate described above and therefore approximate fair value at december  at december   the company s long term debt had a carrying value of  and an estimated fair value of  the fair value was determined based on recent arms length transactions 
in september  the sports authority of the county of wilson tennessee issued  in variable rate tax exempt infrastructure revenue bonds  of which  was outstanding at december  these bonds are direct obligations of the sports authority and are therefore not recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet  however  the company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates for these bonds 
a significant change in interest rates could result in the company being responsible for debt service payments not covered by the sales and incremental property taxes generated from the facility
