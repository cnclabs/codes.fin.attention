item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we currently have a revenue sharing agreement in place that determines how much revenue we earn from swissqual sales and  conversely  how much revenue swissqual earns from our sales to customers located outside the european region 
swissqual is expected to continue as exclusive reseller of our seven 
five product platform in the european region through january we are currently establishing a direct sales and support organization for the european region to replace swissqual once the current reseller agreement expires 
additionally  we are exploring other potential strategic alliances that could enhance our technologies  positioning  and global footprint for sales and support 
emergency call box systems 
we market and sell our call box systems primarily to state and local government agencies located in california through a direct sales force located in irvine  california 
mobile power products chargesource 
we have primarily sold our chargesource products through private label resellers 
we currently have a supply agreement with kensington  a tier one distributor of consumer electronics  to exclusively distribute certain of our chargesource products to big box retailers and other channels 
competition wireless test solutions 
the market for our hardware and software test tools is highly competitive and is served by numerous providers 
our primary competitors with respect to our wts products are agilent technologies  ascom  ericsson  and andrew corporation 
additionally  we expect spirent plc spirent  through its acquisition of swissqual  to become a competitor once our reseller agreement with swissqual expires in january many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources 
the wireless industry is characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions  and evolving industry standards 
to compete successfully in our market  we believe we must properly identify customer needs  price our products competitively  innovate and develop new or enhanced products  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 

table of contents emergency call box systems 
the market for our emergency call box systems is also served by numerous competitors  including us commlink owned by cne group  inc  gai tronics owned by hubbell  inc  talk a phone  and other manufacturers of wireless and wireline emergency and information communication devices 
certain of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources 
mobile power products chargesource 
numerous providers  including mobility electronics  inc  targus  belkin and fellowes 
the cellular telephone and personal computer oems also serve the market for our chargesource mobile power products 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources 
we believe that the patents that cover our chargesource products provide us with a competitive advantage 
however  our ability to compete in these markets depends on our ability to successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes 
key customers we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
wireless test solutions 
in fiscal  revenue derived from verizon and swissqual accounted for million or percent and million or percent of total revenue  respectively 
in fiscal  revenue derived from swissqual and tim cellular sa  a wireless carrier based in brazil  accounted for million or percent and million or percent of total revenue  respectively 
currently  we rely exclusively on swissqual to resell our wts product platform  seven 
five  in the european marketplace 
during january  percent of the outstanding shares  including our percent ownership interest  of swissqual were purchased by spirent 
if swissqual sales significantly decrease  our revenue  operating results  and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
we currently expect swissqual to continue as our exclusive reseller in our european region until january however  we are unsure as to what long term effect  if any  the sale of swissqual to spirent will have on swissqual s future sales of our products 
see the section below entitled risk factors 
emergency call box systems 
our call box business derives a significant portion of its revenue from state and local government agencies 
total revenue from these government agencies totaled million or percent  million or percent  and million or percent in fiscal   and  respectively 
mobile power products chargesource 
in fiscal  kensington  the distributor of our mobile power products  accounted for million or percent of total revenue 
additionally  in fiscal and  targus  the former distributor of our mobile power products  accounted for million or percent  and million or percent of total revenue  respectively 
the spending patterns of swissqual  verizon  kensington  or any of our other key customers can vary significantly from year to year 
any significant reduction in the spending patterns of these customers could adversely affect our revenue  operating results  and cash flows 
international operations we sell our wts and chargesource products to customers located throughout the world 
in fiscal   and  we derived percent  percent  and percent of our total revenue  respectively  from customers in the united states and percent  percent  and percent  respectively  from customers in foreign countries  as determined by the ship to address 
the sharp increase in the percentage of sales to foreign countries during fiscal is due to increased sales of our wts products through swissqual  coupled with decreased sales of our chargesource products due to the transition to a new distributor  which historically have been predominately sold in north america 
in fiscal  sales to brazil accounted for million or percent of total revenue 
in fiscal and there were no foreign countries from which we derived more than percent of total revenue 

table of contents research and development we sell our products in markets that are characterized by rapid technology changes  frequent new product introductions  and evolving technology standards 
accordingly  we devote significant resources to design and develop new and enhanced products that can be manufactured cost effectively and sold at competitive prices 
to focus these efforts  we strive to maintain close relationships with our customers and develop products that meet their needs 
as of april   we had approximately engineers and other technical personnel dedicated to our research and development efforts 
generally  our research and development and other engineering efforts are managed and focused on a product by product basis  and can generally be characterized as follows we collaborate closely with our customers and partners to design and manufacture new products or modify existing products to specifications required by our customers  we design and manufacture enhancements and improvements to our existing products in response to our customers requests or feedback  and we independently design and build new products in anticipation of the needs of our customers as they transition existing wireless networks to next generation technologies 
manufacturing and suppliers we maintain one manufacturing facility located in irvine  california  which is iso certified 
our manufacturing process involves the assembly of numerous individual component products by production technicians 
the parts and materials used by us consist primarily of printed circuit boards and related assemblies  specialized subassemblies  fabricated housings and chassis  and mobile telephones 
most of our components and sub assemblies are manufactured by third parties to our specifications and are generally delivered to us for final assembly and testing 
during fiscal  we ceased manufacturing our chargesource products in house  and transitioned all manufacturing responsibility related to these products to a contract manufacturer located in china 
patents and intellectual property we hold patents that cover key technical aspects of our chargesource products 
however  we generally rely on a combination of trade secrets  copyrights  and contractual rights to protect our intellectual property embodied in the hardware and software products of our wts business 
industry practices impacting working capital existing industry practices that affect working capital and operating cash flow include the level of variability of customer orders relative to the volume of production  vendor lead times  materials availability for critical parts  inventory levels held to achieve rapid customer fulfillment  and provisions of extended payment terms to certain foreign customers 
currently  we sell our products under purchase orders that are placed with short term delivery requirements 
as a result  we maintain significant levels of inventory and associated production and technical staff in order to meet our obligations 
delays in planned customer orders could result in higher inventory levels and negatively impact our operating results 
our standard terms require customers to pay for our products in us dollars 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  we may limit our exposure to losses from foreign currency transactions through forward foreign exchange contracts 
to date  sales denominated in foreign currencies have not been significant and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 

table of contents employees as of april   we employed approximately employees 
we believe our employee relations to be good 
the majority of our employees are professional or technical personnel who possess training and experience in engineering  computer science  and management 
our future success depends in large part on our ability to retain key technical  marketing  and management personnel  and to attract and retain qualified employees  particularly the highly skilled radio  design  process  and test engineers involved in the development of new products 
competition for such personnel can be intense  and the loss of key employees  as well as the failure to recruit and train additional technical personnel in a timely manner  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the contribution of our executive officers and other key employees 
our employee stock option plan expired during may during december  the board of directors approved and adopted a new employee equity incentive plan the plan covering  shares of our common stock 
the adoption of the plan is subject to shareholder approval and is being put to a vote at the company s annual shareholders meeting in june item a 
risk factors a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of our wts products to customers in the wireless communications industry  which has experienced a significant downturn during the past several years 
if the wireless communications industry does not continue to improve  our operating results and financial condition could suffer 
revenue from the sale of our wts products accounted for percent of our total revenue in fiscal wireless carriers are the primary customers for our wts products 
these customers operate in an environment driven by new technology  increased competition  and regulatory change 
to compete effectively  the wireless carriers must offer their subscribers lower prices  improved quality of service  and innovative new services 
increasing minutes of use  global subscribers  and data intensive applications are driving higher capacity utilization of existing networks  requiring wireless carriers around the globe to place a greater emphasis on capital expenditures devoted to their wireless networks 
we continue to believe that wireless carriers are allocating increasing levels of capital resources to meet consumer demands 
if wireless carriers reduce their capital investments in wireless infrastructure and related test tools offered by our wts business  our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the sale and maintenance of emergency call box systems to governmental customers that have experienced severe budgetary constraints in the recent past 
if current and planned projects to install or upgrade call box systems are delayed  our operating results and financial condition could suffer 
revenue from the sale and maintenance of our emergency call box systems and upgrades accounted for percent of our revenues in fiscal approximately of our call box revenue is derived from state and local governmental agencies in california  which prior to fiscal  were experiencing severe budgetary constraints 
as a result  several of our planned projects to install or upgrade call box systems were delayed in fiscal and if these adverse budgetary conditions recur  we expect significant reductions in spending by our governmental customers  which would likely adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
failure to adjust our operations due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our operating results 
during the past several years  the spending patterns of many of our wts customers have been volatile and unpredictable 
in addition  consumer demand for our chargesource mobile power products has been subject to 
table of contents fluctuations as a result of our choices of distribution partners  market acceptance of our recently released products  the timing and size of customer orders  and consumer demand for rechargeable mobile electronic devices 
accordingly  it has been difficult for us to forecast the demand for these products 
we also are limited in our ability to quickly adapt our manufacturing and related cost structures because a significant portion of our sales and marketing  design and other engineering  and manufacturing costs are fixed 
if customer demand for our wts and call box products declines or if we otherwise fail to accurately forecast reduced customer demand  we will likely experience excess capacity  which could adversely affect our operating results 
conversely  if market conditions improve  our manufacturing capacity may not be adequate to fill increased customer demand 
as a result  we might not be able to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner  which could adversely affect our customer relationships and operating results 
the wts and chargesource products we make are complex and have short life cycles 
if we are unable to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new products  some of our products may become obsolete and our operating results could suffer 
the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
additionally  our chargesource mobile power products have short life cycles  and may become obsolete over relatively short periods of time 
our future success depends on our ability to develop  introduce  and deliver on a timely basis and in sufficient quantity new products  components  and enhancements 
the success of any new product offering will depend on several factors  including our ability to properly identify customer needs and technological trends  timely develop new technologies and applications  price our products and services competitively  timely manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volume  and differentiate our products from those of our competitors 
development of new products requires high levels of innovation from both our engineers and our component suppliers 
development of a new product often requires a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the product 
if we dedicate a significant amount of resources to the development of products that do not achieve broad market acceptance  our operating results may suffer 
our operating results may also be adversely affected due to the timing of product introductions by competitors  especially when a competitor introduces a new product before our own comparable product is ready to be introduced 
the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries are highly competitive  and our profitability will be adversely affected if we are not able to compete effectively 
the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries in which we sell our products are highly competitive in many areas  including the timing of development and introduction of new products  technology  price  quality  and customer service and support 
our competitors range from some of the respective industries largest corporations to many relatively small and highly specialized firms 
many of our competitors possess advantages over us  including greater financial and marketing resources  greater name recognition and larger and more established customer and supplier relationships 
our competitors also may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer needs 
if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages  we could lose customers causing our revenue to decline 

table of contents the average selling prices of our products may decrease over their sales cycles  especially upon the introduction of new products  which may negatively affect our revenue and operating results 
our products may experience a reduction in the average selling prices over their respective sales cycles 
further  as we introduce new or next generation products  sales prices of legacy products may decline substantially 
in order to sell products that have a falling average selling price and maintain margins at the same time  we need to continually reduce product and manufacturing costs 
there can be no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to reduce these costs 
in order to do so  we must carefully manage the price paid for components used in our products  as well as manage our inventory costs to reduce overall product costs 
if we are unable to reduce the cost of legacy products as new products are introduced  our average gross margins may decline and adversely affect our operating results 
a significant portion of our revenue is dependent in part upon our relationships with our strategic distribution partners and their performance 
if we are unable to successfully manage our relationships with the distributors of our mobile power products  our revenue and operating results could suffer 
our chargesource mobile power products are distributed by kensington  a tier one distributor of consumer electronics 
due to the terms of our agreement with kensington  our direct access to certain significant distribution channels may be limited 
accordingly  our success will depend in part upon kensington s ability and willingness to effectively and widely distribute our chargesource products 
if kensington does not purchase the volume of products that we anticipate  our revenue and results of operations will suffer 
in fiscal  swissqual accounted for million or percent of total revenue 
during january  we sold our percent ownership interest in swissqual to spirent 
see section entitled wireless test solutions of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we currently expect swissqual to continue as our exclusive reseller in our european region until january we are currently establishing a direct sales and support organization for the european region to replace swissqual once the current reseller agreement expires 
additionally  we are exploring other potential strategic alliances that could enhance our technologies  positioning  and global footprint for sales and support 
however  we are unsure as to what long term effect  if any  the sale of swissqual to spirent will have on swissqual s future sales of our products 
our success will depend in part upon our ability to replace swissqual as the provider of sales and support services and upon our ability to compete with spirent 
a significant portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of customers  and any loss of  cancellation or delay in purchases by these customers could cause a significant decrease in our revenue 
we have historically derived a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of customers 
our three key customers for fiscal accounted for million or percent of total revenue 
swissqual accounted for million or percent of total revenue 
during january  we sold our percent ownership interest in swissqual to spirent 
see section entitled wireless test solutions of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we currently expect swissqual to continue as our exclusive reseller in our european region until january however  we are unsure as to what long term effect  if any  the sale of swissqual will have on swissqual s future sales of our products 
kensington  the distributor of our mobile power products  accounted for million or percent of total revenue 
our current distribution agreement with kensington requires them to purchase minimum quantities from us during the term of the agreement  however  it is not assured that kensington will be able to meet its purchase commitments  or meet or exceed our historical level of unit sales 
if swissqual  kensington  or any of our other key customers reduces  cancels  or delays orders from us  and we are not able to develop other customers who purchase products at comparable levels  our revenue could decrease significantly 
in addition any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more of our key customers would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a large percentage of our revenue 

table of contents we may experience quality or safety defects in our products that could cause us to institute product recalls  require us to provide replacement products and harm our reputation 
in the course of conducting our business  we experience and attempt to address various quality and safety issues with our products 
often product defects are identified during our design  development  and manufacturing processes  which we are able to correct timely 
sometimes  defects are identified after introduction and shipment of products 
if we are unable to timely fix defects or adequately address quality control issues  our relationships with our customers may be impaired  our reputation may suffer and we may lose customers 
any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
economic  political and other risks associated with our international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations 
we currently maintain sales and support operations in the united states  china  europe  and latin america 
our international operations accounted for approximately percent of our revenue in fiscal accordingly  our business is subject to worldwide economic and market conditions and risks generally associated with doing business abroad  such as fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates  weaknesses in the economic conditions in particular countries or regions  the stability of international monetary conditions  tariff and trade policies  domestic and foreign tax policies  foreign governmental regulations  political unrest and disruptions and delays in shipments 
specifically  our chargesource contract manufacturer and a majority of our component suppliers are located in asia 
we do business with our foreign supply base in us dollars 
our costs increase in countries with currencies that are increasing in value against the us dollar 
also  we cannot be sure that our international supply base will continue to accept orders denominated in us dollars 
if they do not  our costs will become more directly subject to foreign exchange fluctuations 
these factors  among others  could adversely affect our sales of products and services in international markets 
additionally  we have limited experience selling our products and services in markets outside our regions in the americas and europe 
however  it is currently our intention to expand our international operations and establish additional sales and support offices in primary international markets 
if our international sales efforts are not successful  our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected 
our failure to address laws and regulations governing our government contracts  could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we depend on contracts with state and local governmental agencies for a significant portion of our revenue  and are subject to various laws and regulations that only apply to companies doing business with the government 
for example  we supply call box products and provide system installation and long term maintenance services to regional and municipal transit authorities and other governmental agencies 
in fiscal  we derived percent of our revenue from contracts with these governmental customers 
from time to time we are also subject to investigation for compliance with regulations governing our government contracts 
our failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in suspension of these contracts  or subject us to administrative claims 
disruptions in our relationships with our suppliers or in our suppliers operations could result in shortages of necessary components and adversely affect our operations 
we currently procure  and expect to continue to procure  certain components from single source manufacturers who provide unique component designs or who meet certain quality and performance requirements 
in addition  we sometimes purchase customized components from single sources in order to take advantage of volume pricing discounts 
in fiscal  only the contract manufacturer of our chargesource products  which provided million or percent of all inventory purchases  provided more than percent of total inventory purchases 

table of contents the performance of these suppliers is largely outside our control 
in the past  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  shortages of important single source components 
our suppliers may fail to timely deliver components or provide components of sufficient quality 
if this occurs  we may need to adjust both product designs and production schedules  which could result in delays in the production and delivery of products to our customers 
these delays or defects could harm our reputation and impair our customer relationships 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation  settlement or licensing costs and expenses or be prevented from selling certain products 
third parties have claimed  and may in the future claim  that we are infringing their intellectual property rights 
these intellectual property infringement claims  whether we ultimately are found to be infringing any third party s intellectual property rights or not  are time consuming  costly to defend  and divert resources and management attention away from our operations 
infringement claims by third parties also could subject us to significant damage awards or fines or require us to pay large amounts to settle such claims 
additionally  claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
if we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on acceptable terms or substitute similar technology from other sources  we could be prevented from or restricted in selling our products containing  or manufactured with  the infringed technology 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property rights  and we may be required to spend significant resources enforcing these rights or otherwise suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we generally rely upon patent  copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws in the united states and in certain other countries  and rely on confidentiality agreements with our employees  customers  and partners to establish and maintain our intellectual proprietary rights in our proprietary technology 
we are required to spend significant resources to monitor and enforce our intellectual property rights  however these rights might not necessarily provide us with a sufficient competitive advantage 
our intellectual proprietary rights could be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented by competitors or others 
our employees  customers or partners could breach our confidentiality agreements  for which we may not have an adequate remedy available 
we also may not be able to timely detect the infringement of our intellectual property rights  which could harm our competitive position 
finally  the rapid pace of technological change in the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries could make certain of our key proprietary technology obsolete or provide us with less of a competitive advantage 
if we suffer the loss of our manufacturing facility due to catastrophe  our operations would be adversely affected 
we have one manufacturing facility  which is located in irvine  california 
although we carry insurance for property damage  we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for all possible catastrophes  including interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism 
any significant disruption in our manufacturing operation at the facility  whether due to fire  natural disaster  or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
additionally  as previously discussed  during fiscal we transitioned the manufacturing of our chargesource products to a contract manufacturer located in china 
if any significant disruption occurs in the facility in china  it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we depend upon the services of key personnel  and may not be able to attract and retain additional key personnel 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our key research  engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel 
if for any reason our key personnel left our employ and 
table of contents we failed to replace a sufficient number of these personnel  we might not be able to maintain or expand our business 
competition for such highly skilled personnel in our wireless communications and consumer electronics industries is intense  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to hire or re hire sufficiently qualified personnel in adequate numbers to meet the demand for our products and services 
if we are unable to identify  hire and integrate these skilled personnel in a timely or cost efficient manner  our operating results could suffer 
we may not be able to successfully integrate future acquisitions  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have acquired  and are likely to acquire in the future  businesses  products  and technologies that complement or expand our current operations 
acquisitions could require significant capital investments and require us to integrate with companies that have different cultures  management teams and business infrastructure 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the acquisition could depend on several factors  including difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  products and workforces of an acquired business  the retention of key employees  management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  the integration or coordination of different research and development and product manufacturing facilities  successfully converting information and accounting systems  and diversion of resources and management attention from our other operations 
if market conditions or other factors require us to change our strategic direction  we may fail to realize the expected value from one or more of our acquisitions 
our failure to successfully integrate our acquisitions or realize the expected value from past or future acquisitions could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may need additional capital in the future to fund the growth of our businesses  which we may not be able to obtain or obtain on acceptable terms 
we currently anticipate that our available capital resources and operating income will be sufficient to meet our expected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  it is not assured that such resources will be sufficient to fund the long term growth of our business 
in particular  we may experience a negative operating cash flow due to the timing of anticipated sales of our products 
we may raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings if such financings become available on favorable terms 
or we may seek working capital financing under a revolving line of credit 
we cannot assure that any additional financing we may need will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop new products or otherwise respond to competitive pressures 
in any such case  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and  if our operating results decline or are worse than expected  our stock price could fall 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant quarterly fluctuations in revenue and operating results for our three businesses 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for many reasons  including the size and timing of customer orders and shipments  
table of contents the degree and rate of growth in the markets in which we compete and the accompanying demand for our products  limitations in our ability to forecast our manufacturing needs  our ability to introduce  and the timing of our introductions of  new or enhanced products  product failures and recalls  product quality control problems and associated in field service support costs  warranty expenses  availability and cost of components  and changes in average sales prices 
due to these and other factors  our past results are not reliable indicators of our future performance 
in addition  a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed due to sales  engineering and manufacturing overhead 
if we experience a decline in revenue  we may be unable to reduce our fixed costs quickly enough to compensate for the decline  which would magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations 
if our operating results decline or are below expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our stock may decline significantly 
our stock price has been and will likely remain highly volatile 
the stock market in general  and the stock prices of technology and wireless communications companies in particular  have experienced fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
broad market and industry stock price fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock 
the market price of our stock has exhibited significant price fluctuations  which makes our stock unsuitable for many investors 
our stock price may also be affected by the following factors our quarterly operating results  changes in the wireless communications and consumer electronics industries  changes in the economic outlook of the particular markets in which we sell our products and services  the gain or loss of significant customers  reductions in demand or expectations of future demand by our customers  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us  our competitors  or our customers  the timing and announcements of technological innovations or new products by our competitors or by us  and other events affecting other companies that investors deem comparable to us 
our articles of incorporation and shareholder rights plan could make a potential acquisition that is not approved by our board of directors more difficult 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and our shareholder rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
our articles of incorporation prohibit the consummation of a merger  reorganization or recapitalization  sale or lease of a substantial amount of assets with  or issuance of equity securities valued at million or more to a stockholder that owns percent or more of our common stock  unless certain requirements relating to board or shareholder approval are met 
our articles also prohibit shareholder action by written consent  which could make certain changes of control more difficult by requiring the holding of a special meeting of shareholders for purposes of taking shareholder action 

table of contents in addition  in february we adopted a shareholder rights plan whereby  for each outstanding share of common stock  we distributed a preferred stock purchase right entitling the holder to purchase one one hundredth of a share of preferred stock at an exercise price of if any person or group acquires or makes an offer to acquire percent or more of our common stock  the preferred stock purchase right will become exercisable by persons other than the percent or more person or group  unless our board of directors timely redeems the preferred stock purchase right or has approved the offer 
as a result  the preferred stock purchase rights may cause substantial dilution to the ownership of a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
in february  our board of directors terminated our shareholder rights plan effective january  and adopted a policy that  with certain exceptions  requires the board to obtain stockholder approval before adopting any shareholder rights plan in the future 
these provisions in our articles of incorporation and our existing shareholder rights plan could discourage takeover attempts which some shareholders might deem to be in their best interests or in which shareholders would receive a premium for their shares over the then existing market price of our common stock 
the trading volume of our common stock often has been limited and may depress the price for our common stock 
the trading volume of our common stock has been and may continue to be limited 
limited trading volume could depress the price for our common stock because fewer analysts may provide coverage for our stock and because investors might be unwilling to pay a higher market price for a stock that is less liquid 
in addition  limited trading volume  along with market and industry stock price fluctuations and other factors affecting our operations  could result in greater volatility in the price of our common stock 
a significant decline in our stock price  even if temporary  could result in substantial losses for individual shareholders and could subject us to costly and disruptive securities litigation 
item properties our headquarters and primary manufacturing facility is located in irvine  california

overview comarco  inc  through its subsidiary comarco wireless technologies  inc 
collectively  we  comarco  or the company  is a leading provider of wireless test solutions for the wireless industry 
comarco also designs  manufactures  and maintains emergency call box systems and designs mobile power products for notebook computers  cellular telephones  pdas  and other handheld devices 
our operations consist solely of the operations of comarco wireless technologies  inc cwt 
our revenue and related cash flows are primarily derived from sales of our wireless test solutions wts products  emergency call box systems and related maintenance services  and chargesource mobile power products 
we have three reportable segments wts  call box  and chargesource 
see segment reporting in notes and of notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this report 
industry and company trends and uncertainties wireless test solutions our wts business designs and manufactures hardware and software tools for use by wireless carriers  equipment vendors  and others 
radio engineers  network improvement professionals and technicians  and others use these test tools to deploy and optimize wireless networks  and to verify the performance of the wireless networks and resulting quality of service once deployed 
wireless carriers are the primary customers for our wts products 
these customers operate in an environment driven by new technology  increased competition  and regulatory change 
to compete effectively  the wireless carriers must offer their subscribers lower prices  improved quality of service  and innovative new services 
increasing minutes of use  global subscribers  and data intensive applications are driving higher capacity utilization of existing networks  requiring wireless carriers around the globe to place a greater emphasis on capital expenditures devoted to their wireless networks 
we continue to believe that wireless carriers are allocating increasing levels of capital resources to meet consumer demands and should also drive demand for our wts products 
management currently considers the following additional trends  events  and uncertainties to be important to understanding our wts business our north american region experienced significant year over year revenue growth 
revenue is derived from a limited set of customers in each market where we do business and the timing and size of customer orders can vary greatly 
our european region is served by our reseller swissqual ag swissqual 
for the year ended january   revenue derived from swissqual totaled approximately million 

table of contents during january  spirent acquired percent of the outstanding shares of swissqual  including our percent ownership interest  for consideration totaling up to approximately million 
in conjunction with this transaction  we recorded a gain on sale of our percent equity investment in swissqual 
during fiscal  we expect increased competition in our european region 
additionally  we expect our ability to compete on a global basis to be driven by our ability to offer products that cover all current wireless technologies  as well as the timely integration of new technology and functionality into our product platform 
we currently expect swissqual to continue as our exclusive reseller in our european region until january we are currently establishing a direct sales and support organization for the european region to replace swissqual once the current reseller agreement expires 
additionally  we are exploring other potential strategic alliances that could enhance our technologies  positioning  and global footprint for sales and support 
however  we are unsure as to what long term effect  if any  the sale of swissqual to spirent will have on swissqual s future sales of our products 
our success will depend in part upon our ability to replace swissqual as the provider of sales and support services and upon our ability to compete with spirent 
through the end of fiscal  revenue attributable to swissqual sales was deferred until receipt of payment 
commencing with the first quarter of fiscal  we changed our accounting for sales to swissqual by recognizing revenue on a full accrual basis 
this change was made based upon swissqual s financial strength and payment history and the lack of our ability to assert financial influence over the operations of swissqual 
wts revenue for the year ended january  was increased by approximately million due to this change 
during fiscal  our north american region experienced increased spending by certain wireless carriers 
this increased spending can be attributed to several trends i the expanded availability and implementation of new technologies such as g wireless and broadband wireless  ii activity generated by efforts to consolidate networks resulting from recent merger activity  iii network quality enhancement programs to reduce churn  and iv network expansion and capacity programs geared toward enabling new and enhanced services 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we were awarded a contract from verizon wireless verizon for our seven 
five voice and data test systems 
verizon is converting its nationwide wireless network to the cdma evdo standard  which is considered to be the us equivalent of g  and is utilizing seven 
five to measure the quality of its network 
we began delivering on this contract during the second quarter of fiscal and completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded revenue attributable to this contract totaling approximately million  excluding amortization of first year maintenance obligations 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we were awarded an additional contract from verizon to replace data testing equipment previously sourced from a competitor with our seven 
five data systems 
we delivered on the contract during the fourth quarter of fiscal and recorded revenue attributable to this contract totaling approximately million  excluding amortization of first year maintenance obligations 
the two verizon contracts discussed above were significant to our wts business and its operations for the year ended january  while we currently expect to continue to win new business from verizon during fiscal  we do not expect this new business to recur at the same level achieved during fiscal the wireless industry is composed of a relatively small number of wireless carriers and equipment vendors  which can lead to volatility in our results  as our business is characterized by sales to a limited set of customers in each region where we do business 
the timing and size of customer orders can vary greatly making it difficult to forecast our results from period to period 
consequently  our wts business may be affected in any single region by the priorities of a small group of customers 

table of contents under our current agreement  swissqual is responsible for reselling and supporting our co branded seven 
five products in europe  the middle east  and north africa our european region 
we have a revenue sharing agreement in place that determines how much revenue we earn from swissqual sales and  conversely  how much revenue swissqual earns from our sales to customers located outside the european region 
during january  we sold our percent ownership interest in swissqual to spirent 
under the current distribution and sales agreement  swissqual is expected to continue as exclusive reseller of our seven 
five product platform in the european region through january we currently expect spirent  through its acquisition of swissqual  to compete for sales of mobile quality of service and benchmarking tools in the near future 
this increased competition is expected to occur first in those regions of the world that deploy the wireless technologies currently adopted in our european region and with which swissqual has expertise eg gsm  gprs  edge  wcdma umts 
to effectively compete in the americas and portions of asia pacific  vendors of wireless test and measurement tools must also have deep expertise in spread spectrum wireless technologies eg cdma  cdma  xev do  edge 
our current seven 
five product platform is compatible will all current wireless technologies and can be configured for all major markets worldwide 
we are currently establishing a direct sales and support organization for the european region to replace swissqual once the current reseller agreement expires 
additionally  we are exploring other potential strategic alliances that could enhance our technologies  positioning  and global footprint for sales and support 
emergency call box systems our emergency call box business designs and manufactures emergency call box systems 
our call box products provide emergency communication over existing wireless networks 
in addition to call box products  we provide system installation and long term maintenance services 
currently  there are approximately  call boxes that we maintain under long term agreements that expire at various dates through february wireless carriers have begun reallocating spectrum away from analog  or first generation  wireless technologies to digital  or g and g  wireless technologies 
as a result  state and local agencies are upgrading their existing call box systems to digital to maintain the functional efficiencies of their call box systems 
our upgraded call box products  based on g gsm and cdma technologies  offer a complete solution of current technology and services at a low cost designed to meet our customers needs 
during fiscal and with more than  call box units installed  we have seen strong demand for digital upgrades 
management currently considers the following additional trends  events  and uncertainties to be important to understanding our call box business during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were awarded a project by the san bernardino service authority for freeway emergencies safe to upgrade approximately  call boxes to digital  valued at million 
san bernardino safe also renewed their call box system maintenance contract for approximately million over a five year term 
we commenced work on this contract late in the fourth quarter of fiscal and completed the project during fiscal recording revenue relating to the digital upgrade project totaling approximately million during fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were awarded projects by the san diego safe to upgrade approximately  call boxes with digital and text telephony tty technologies and retrofit approximately  call box sites to improve accessibility for persons with mobility limitations 
these projects are valued at approximately million 
we commenced work on this contract during the fourth quarter of fiscal recording revenue totaling approximately million 
we expect to complete the balance of this upgrade project during fiscal and record revenue totaling approximately million 

table of contents during fiscal  we were awarded multiple projects from various california safes to upgrade approximately  call boxes with a mix of digital and or text telephony tty technologies and to perform other retrofit and site mitigation services 
these projects are valued at approximately million 
we expect to complete a significant portion of these projects during fiscal the subject call box systems are located in the following california counties riverside  merced  monterey  san benito  santa barbara  and orange 
also included are the call box systems owned by the metropolitan transportation commission safe  which service the nine counties of the san francisco bay area 
as of january   there are approximately  call boxes that we maintain under long term agreements 
certain of our safe customers have indicated that they intend to remove up to  call boxes to reduce the density of the systems and to make funds available for the necessary digital upgrades 
we currently expect that as of january   there will be approximately  call boxes which we maintain under long term agreements 
service revenue attributable to maintenance of existing call box systems is expected to total approximately million in fiscal current and anticipated projects to upgrade and expand existing call box systems are concentrated with several customers that are agencies of california s state and local governments  from whom we currently generate approximately percent of our call box revenue 
in addition  we believe that the severe financial challenges experienced by california state government created uncertainty for our governmental customers in california  causing them to delay upgrades and expansions of certain call box systems 
while this trend appears to have reversed  as evidenced by the awarded projects discussed above  we continue to be vulnerable to the spending patterns of our customers that are concentrated in california 
mobile power products chargesource designed with the needs of the traveling professional in mind  our chargesource mobile power products provide a high level of functionality and compatibility in an industry leading compact design 
our current and planned product offering consists of universal ac dc  ac  and dc power adapters designed for the right mix of power output and functionality for most retail  oem  and enterprise customers 
our chargesource products are also universal allowing those who use rechargeable electronic devices to carry just one power adapter 
by simply changing the compact smarttip connected to the end of the charging cable  our universal power adapters are capable of charging and powering multiple target devices  including most notebook computers  cellular telephones  pdas  and other handheld devices 
prior to fiscal  most notebook computers required no more than watts of power to operate 
however  the personal computer industry is continuing to transition to notebook computers with increasing power requirements 
as power requirements increase  so does the size of the oem power adapter sold with each notebook computer 
to address this industry wide trend  we have developed a family of high power chargesource products that are compatible with most legacy  current  and planned notebook computers 
these new chargesource products are able to deliver up to watts of power in a very small form factor 
management currently considers the following additional trends  events  and uncertainties to be important to understanding our chargesource business during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into a supply agreement with kensington  a tier one distributor of consumer electronics  to distribute certain of our chargesource products to big box retailers and other channels 
during fiscal  we began shipping to kensington as they obtained product placement within the retail channels 
we currently expect to continue to ramp up production of kensington branded chargesource products throughout fiscal during january we entered into a supply agreement with belkin corporation belkin and the belkin supply agreement and began shipping a limited number of chargesource units to belkin late 
table of contents in the first quarter of fiscal the subsequent sales and marketing efforts  as well as the ramp up of unit sales of the belkin branded chargesource products did not meet our original expectations 
the belkin supply agreement was terminated in conjunction with the execution of the mutual release during the third quarter of fiscal in addition to transitioning the distribution of our chargesource products to kensington  during fiscal  we transitioned the manufacturing of our redesigned chargesource product line to a contract manufacturer located in china 
these distribution and manufacturing initiatives  which are expected to enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace  interrupted our business during fiscal and resulting in lower revenue from the sales of our chargesource products 
the current level of chargesource sales is insufficient to fully absorb our fixed overheard 
our ability to continue to penetrate the retail channels and the oem after market accessories market is dependent upon the retailers and our oem partners and the timing of their respective initiatives 
accordingly  it has been difficult for us to predict when our chargesource sales would reach sufficient levels to support our current cost structure 
however  we are encouraged by our current level of retail penetration and product placement and continue to believe that our chargesource business can break even with quarterly revenue of approximately million 
on march  and in cooperation with the us consumer products safety commission cpsc  we voluntarily initiated a product safety recall of our legacy chargesource watt universal ac power adapters 
comarco and targus entered into an agreement to address the impact of the recall action 
under the terms of the agreement comarco issued a million credit to targus in fiscal in consideration of a full release 
of the million credit issued to targus in the fourth quarter of fiscal  qualifying product returns totaling million were received from targus through october  during the third quarter of fiscal  the remaining million unused credit was recorded as revenue  consistent with the expiration of the right of return and the term of the agreement 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to apply accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments 
our significant accounting policies are presented in note to our consolidated financial statements 
of our significant accounting policies  we believe the following involve a higher degree of uncertainty  subjectivity and judgments 
these policies involve estimates and judgments that are inherently uncertain 
changes in these estimates and judgments may significantly impact our annual and quarterly operating results 
we have identified the following as our most significant critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue upon shipment provided there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
generally  our products are shipped fob named point of shipment  whether it is irvine  our corporate headquarters  or hong kong  the shipping point of our chargesource products 
shipments to swissqual  our wts distributor in europe  are shipped delivery duties unpaid ddu 
under ddu  title and risk of loss for the goods shipped passes to the buyer at destination 
our wts products are integrated with embedded software 
accordingly  we recognize revenue using the residual method pursuant to requirements of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
under the residual method  we allocate revenue to the undelivered element  typically maintenance  based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
we amortize the revenue allocated to the maintenance element evenly over the term of the maintenance commitment made at the time of sale 
we expense as incurred the costs associated with honoring the maintenance commitment 
the revenue attributable to the 
table of contents delivered product is the residual amount after subtracting the revenue allocated to the undelivered element from the sales price 
the revenue attributable to the delivered product is recognized following the policy for product sales described above 
we recognize service revenue as the services are performed 
maintenance revenue from extended warranty sales is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  typically months 
significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
for our wts business  management must make judgments  for example  regarding uncertainties surrounding customer acceptance because some orders may include acceptance test provisions that require we defer revenue upon shipment until such time as the client has accepted the equipment 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments 
software development costs we had million of capitalized software as of january   net of accumulated amortization of million 
capitalized software amortization expense is included in cost of revenue 
we capitalize software developed for sale or lease in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
software costs incurred subsequent to the determination of the technological feasibility of the software product are capitalized 
technological feasibility is generally demonstrated by the completion of a working model 
our policy is to capitalize the costs associated with development of new products and expense the costs associated with new releases  which primarily consist of enhancements or increased functionality of software embedded in existing products 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether technological feasibility has been achieved for a particular software project and in estimating the economic life of the related product 
capitalization ceases and amortization of capitalized costs begins when the software product is available for general release to our customers 
each quarter we compare capitalized software development costs to our estimate of projected revenues quarterly to determine if any impairment in value has occurred that would require an adjustment in the carrying value or change in expected useful lives under the guidelines established under sfas no 
we also continually evaluate the recoverability of software acquired through acquisition or by direct purchase of technology 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and related terms based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
we continually monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
specifically  our management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management analyzes specific customer accounts and establishes reserves for uncollectible receivables based upon specific identification of account balances that have indications of uncertainty of collection 
indications of uncertainty of collections may include the customer s inability to pay  customer dissatisfaction  or other factors 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our losses for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 

table of contents valuation of inventory we value inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory calculated on average costs  which approximates first in  first out basis or market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a write down of excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on excess quantities on hand based upon component usage in the preceding months 
as demonstrated during prior periods  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our operating results 
income taxes we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense in conjunction with the evaluation and measurement of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary timing differences result in the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on a net basis and included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess on a periodic basis the probability that our net deferred tax assets  if any  will be recovered 
if after evaluating all of the positive and negative evidence  a conclusion is made that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be recovered  a valuation allowance is provided with a corresponding charge to tax expense to reserve the portion of the deferred tax assets which are estimated to be more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any required valuation allowance 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of incurring cumulative losses for a three year period  we established a valuation allowance totaling approximately million  or the entire deferred tax asset balance existing as of the beginning of fiscal  as reclassified 
we reclassified  of reserves relating to research and experimentation credits included in the current taxes receivable as of january  to the net deferred tax asset upon the determination that it was more likely than not that the benefit of  would not be realized 
in addition  a full valuation allowance has been provided on all net deferred tax asset additions during fiscal  resulting in a fully reserved net tax asset 
this valuation allowance was established based on management s overall assessment of risks and uncertainties related to our future ability to realize  and hence  utilize certain deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses  carry forward temporary differences and future tax deductions resulting from certain types of stock option exercises 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of  due to the generation of refund claims created upon completion of our fiscal corporate tax returns  which were completed in the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we recorded net income of million and utilized approximately million of our net operating loss carryforwards 
the remaining net deferred tax asset of million at january   continues to be fully reserved 
valuation of goodwill we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  we no longer amortize goodwill from 
table of contents acquisitions  but continue to amortize other acquisition related intangibles and costs 
as of january   we had million of goodwill recorded in our audited consolidated balance sheet 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value generally determined using a discounted cash flow methodology applied to the particular unit 
this methodology differs from our previous policy  in accordance with accounting standards existing at that time  of using undiscounted cash flows on an enterprise wide basis to determine recoverability 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash charge of million to write down fully the carrying value of the goodwill related to our edx reporting unit 
as the net assets of the edx reporting unit were sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal  such charge is reflected as a component of discontinued operations 
future impairments of intangible assets  if any  will be recorded as operating expenses 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of january   and identified no impairment 
the impairment review is based upon a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future market share and revenue and costs for the reporting units  as well as appropriate discount rates 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses 
however  if we fail to deliver new products for these groups  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or if market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable  revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
for intangible assets with definite useful lives  we amortize the cost over the estimated useful lives and assess any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we also annually review the useful lives of each of our intangible assets 
as of january   we had million of non goodwill acquired intangible assets recorded in intangible assets  which includes million for software rights and million for intellectual property rights 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets used in operations  including purchased intangible assets  when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns that negatively impact our customers or markets  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of assets is impaired based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using a weighted average of the market approach and the discounted expected future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our cost of capital 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected discounted cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates of anticipated future net revenue  the remaining estimated economic life of the products and technologies  or both  could differ from those used to assess the recoverability of these assets 
in that event  additional impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long lived assets could be required

as a percentage of revenue  cost of revenue in fiscal decreased by percentage points to percent 
excluding amortization of software development costs  cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue in fiscal decreased percentage points to percent compared to fiscal the fiscal decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was principally due to increased year over year sales of our wts products in our north american region made by our direct sales force and increased absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead attributable to increased manufacturing activity experienced by our three business segments  partially offset by increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million 
cost of product revenue decreased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal due to significantly lower sales of our chargesource products during fiscal  related cost of revenue decreased approximately million  which was partially offset by a million increase in cost of revenue attributable to sales of our wts products 
gross margin in fiscal decreased percentage points to percent primarily due to lower sales of our chargesource products during fiscal and the inability to absorb fixed manufacturing and start up costs attributable to transitioning the production of our chargesource products to a contract manufacturer located in china  as well as increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million

selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased approximately million  or percent  compared to fiscal primarily due to legal settlements and related fees incurred in fiscal  totaling approximately million  which exceeded similar type costs incurred in fiscal by approximately million 
additionally  bad debt expense decreased  in fiscal  primarily due to the reversal of previously established reserves for uncollectible chargesource accounts receivable that were collected 
offsetting the decrease in legal related expenses and bad debt expense and consistent with increased sales of our wts products  selling related expenses increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal allocated corporate overhead consists of salaries and other personnel related expenses of our accounting and finance  human resources and benefits  and other administrative personnel  as well as professional fees  directors fees  and other costs and expenses attributable to being a public company 
these costs are typically allocated to our three segments based on each business s percentage share of total company costs and expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  allocated corporate overhead remained stable at percent and percent of revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
the million increase in fiscal allocated corporate overhead relates primarily to consulting fees incurred for sarbanes oxley readiness of million and increased professional services expense of million  primarily audit and tax related  and increased incentive compensation of approximately million reflecting improved financial results in fiscal gross engineering and support expenses generally consist of salaries  employer paid benefits  and other personnel related costs of our hardware and software design engineers and testing and product support personnel  as well as facility and it costs  professional and consulting fees  lab costs  material usages  and travel and related costs incurred in the development and support of our products 
engineering and support expenses in fiscal increased approximately million compared to fiscal following a million decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal during the first half of fiscal  our wts business completed the development of our seven 
five product platform 
as a result  we were able to reduce our engineering and support costs in fiscal and maintain stable engineering and support expenses in fiscal 
table of contents we capitalize costs incurred for the development of software embedded in our wts products subsequent to establishing technological feasibility 
these capitalized costs are subject to an ongoing assessment of recoverability based on anticipated future revenue and changes in hardware and software technologies 
costs that are capitalized include direct labor and related overhead 
we did not capitalize any software development costs in fiscal or as we completed the development of the software embedded in our seven 
five product platform during the first half of fiscal currently  we do not expect to capitalize software development costs during fiscal capitalized software development costs totaled approximately million for fiscal and were consistent with the timing of the seven 
five product platform development program 
other income  net other income  net  consists primarily of interest income earned on invested cash balances 
other income  net  was   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
the increase in other income in over of  is due to increases in our cash balances coupled with higher interest rates 
the decline in other income in over is primarily caused by reduced interest income earned on decreased cash balances 
gain on sale of investment in swissqual and intangible asset as further discussed in the section entitled results of operations wireless test solutions during january  we sold our percent interest in swissqual 
upon the closing of the transaction  we received approximately million of the closing consideration  net of transaction costs  and may receive up to an additional million of any escrow distribution and contingent consideration 
we recorded a gain on sale of investment totaling million  which was based on the cash consideration we received 
prior to the sale transaction  swissqual declared and paid a dividend to its then current shareholders 
during january  we recorded the approximately million dividend declared as a reduction in the cost basis of our investment in swissqual 
additionally  during december  we sold rights to software to swissqual for approximately million 
at the time of the sale  such software rights had an unamortized book value of approximately million 
accordingly  we recorded a gain on sale of intangible assets totaling approximately million 
income tax expense benefit significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any required valuation allowance 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we established a valuation allowance totaling approximately million  or the entire deferred tax asset balance existing as of the beginning of fiscal  as reclassified 
in addition  a full valuation allowance has been provided on all net deferred tax asset additions during fiscal  resulting in a fully reserved net tax asset 
this valuation allowance was established based on management s overall assessment of risks and uncertainties related to our future ability to realize  and hence  utilize certain deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses  carry forward temporary differences and future tax deductions resulting from certain types of stock option exercises 
due to the losses of the third and fourth quarters  the adjusted net deferred tax assets remain fully reserved as of january  during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of  due to the generation of refund claims created upon completion of fiscal corporate tax returns  which were completed in the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we recorded net income of million and million in amt income tax expense and utilized approximately million of our net operating loss carryforwards

these contracts were significant to our wts business and its operations for fiscal and were primarily responsible for the fiscal revenue increase in our north american region  which increased percent compared to fiscal revenue in fiscal derived from our customers in latin america south america decreased percent compared to fiscal this decrease highlights that the wireless industry is composed of a relatively small number of wireless carriers and equipment vendors  which can lead to volatility in our results and that our business is characterized by sales to a limited set of customers in each region where we do business 
the timing and size of customer orders can vary greatly making it difficult to forecast our results from period to period 
consequently  our wts business is affected in any single region by the priorities of a small group of customers

kensington replaced belkin as our exclusive distributor for the retail channels during the third quarter of fiscal revenue in fiscal decreased by percent over fiscal this decrease is attributable to disruption in our business caused by the following initiatives replacing targus and belkin with kensington as our exclusive distributor for the retail channels during fiscal  redesigning our entire chargesource product line  and transitioning all product manufacturing to a contract manufacturer located in china 
the above initiatives were substantially completed during fiscal and are expected to enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace during fiscal in fiscal and in cooperation with the us cpsc  we announced a voluntary product safety recall of approximately  detachable plugs used on our legacy chargesource watt universal ac power adapter

table of contents business outlook our wts business derives revenue from a limited set of customers and the timing and size of customer orders can vary greatly

currently  we expect wts revenue for fiscal to range from million to million with a stronger second half of the year 
wts revenue for the first quarter ended april  is expected to range between million and million 
regarding chargesource  we expect to continue to gain placement in retail  oem  and other channels through its relationship with kensington and others and launch a range of strategic new products

within the net change in operating assets and liabilities  decreased sales resulted in a decrease in accounts receivable and due from affiliate  increasing cash flow by million  which was offset by a million increase in inventory and a million increase in deferred revenue 
previously  we included cash flows from discontinued operations as a single amount in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
in fiscal  we separately disclosed the components of cash flows of discontinued operations  reconciled operating cash flows from net income rather than income from continuing operations  and restated our statements of cash flows for fiscal and to conform to the current presentation 
we increased our inventory balance in fiscal by approximately million in support of expected demand 
as discussed above  we transitioned the manufacturing of our chargesource products from in house to a contract manufacturer located in china 
in support of this effort  we have procured long lead and other electrical components in accordance with our planned production plan 
it is our current strategy to have our contract manufacturer build chargesource products under a turnkey model  whereby the contract manufacture procures all necessary components directly from our existing supply base and we simply procure the finished good from the contract manufacturer 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we received the first purchase orders for our component inventory  totaling approximately million  from our contract manufacturer 
cash flows from investing activities we purchased million of property and equipment in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the decreases in fiscal and fiscal are primarily due to transitioning manufacturing of our chargesource products from in house to a contract manufacturer located in china 
accordingly  we no longer have requirements to acquire  upgrade  and maintain chargesource production equipment 
additionally  we have outsourced the design of non critical components to our supply chain located in asia  which has reduced our on going investment in tooling 
the development of software is critical to our wts products 
during the first half of fiscal  we completed the development of our seven 
five product platform  which is compatible with all g  g  and g wireless technologies 
during fiscal and subsequent to the completion of the development program  we transitioned into a maintenance mode 
accordingly  we capitalized no software development costs in fiscal and fiscal in fiscal  we capitalized software development costs totaling million 
currently  we do not expect to capitalize any software development in fiscal as our seven 
five product platform is a modular solution that can be upgraded for new wireless technologies and configured for all wireless carriers irrespective of the wireless technologies deployed 
in conjunction with the development and maintenance of seven 
five  we expended million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  on rights to various wireless technologies 
during january  we sold our percent interest in swissqual to spirent 
see the wireless test solutions section of item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents prior to the acquisition by spirent  swissqual declared and paid a dividend to the then current shareholders 
during january  we recorded the approximately million dividend declared as a reduction in the cost basis of our investment in swissqual 
as of january   we have received approximately million  net of million withheld by swiss tax authorities and which we currently expect to be recaptured 
additionally  during december  we sold rights to software to swissqual for approximately million 
at the time of the sale  such software rights had an unamortized book value of approximately million 
accordingly  we recorded a gain on sale of intangible assets totaling approximately million 
during january  we sold the net assets of our edx reporting unit for million in cash and recognized a pre tax gain of million 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal proceeds from the sales of common stock issued through employee and director stock option plans constituted all of our cash flows from financing activities 
in fiscal proceeds from the sales of common stock issued through employee and director stock option plans  offset by the repurchase of our common stock  constituted all of our cash flows from financing activities 
during  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million shares of our common stock 
from program inception through january   we repurchased approximately million shares for an average price of per share 
during fiscal  we repurchased approximately  shares in the open market for an average price of per share 
during fiscal and  we had no stock repurchases 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances will provide us sufficient funds to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
in addition to our cash and cash equivalent balances  we expect to derive a portion of our liquidity from our cash flows from operations 
as discussed above  certain factors and events could negatively affect our cash flows from operations  including due to the uncertainties associated with the spending patterns of our customers and the corresponding demand for our wts products  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in demand 
such fluctuations have caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in revenue  operating results  and cash flows 
we rely exclusively on swissqual to sell to and support customers in a very important region  europe 
should swissqual sales decrease or if their ability to pay for our products becomes impaired  our revenue  operating results  and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
we are currently establishing a direct sales and support organization for the european region to replace swissqual once the current reseller agreement expires 
additionally  we are exploring other potential strategic alliances that could enhance our technologies  positioning  and global footprint for sales and support 
we are unsure as to what long term effect  if any  the sale of swissqual to spirent will have on swissqual s future sales of our products 
in the event kensington  the distributor of our chargesource products  is unable to perform under their non cancelable commitments due to their inability to take delivery of the products and or pay for such products in a timely manner  we would be required to establish alternative distribution channels 
such significant change would negatively impact our revenue  operating results  and cash flows 
should the contract manufacturer of our chargesource products become unable to manufacturer our chargesource products at the level currently anticipated  our operating results and cash flows would be negatively impacted 
we are focused on preserving our cash balances by continuously monitoring expenses  identifying cost savings  and investing only in those development programs and products most likely to contribute to our profitability

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency risk we are exposed to the risk of changes in currency exchange rates 
as of january   we had no material accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
our standard terms require customers to pay for our products and services in us dollars 
for those orders denominated in foreign currencies  we may limit our exposure to losses from foreign currency transactions through forward foreign exchange contracts 
to date  sales denominated in foreign currencies have not been significant and we have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts 
interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in value 
to minimize this risk  we maintain a significant portion of our cash balances in money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we do not hold any derivative financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents have maturities dates of three months or less and the fair value approximates the carrying value in our financial statements 
equity price risk our short term investments consist of balances maintained in a non qualified deferred compensation plan funded by our executives and directors 
we value these investments using the closing market value for the last day of each month 
these investments are subject to market price volatility 
we reflect these investments on our balance sheet at their market value  with the unrealized gains and losses reflected as adjustments to both short term investments and the deferred compensation liability 
we have also invested in equity instruments of swissqual  a privately held company 
as previously discussed  we sold our percent interest in swissqual to spirent in january due to the inherent risk associated with some of our investments  and in light of current stock market conditions  we may incur future losses on the sales  write downs  or write offs of our investments 
we do not currently hedge against equity price changes
