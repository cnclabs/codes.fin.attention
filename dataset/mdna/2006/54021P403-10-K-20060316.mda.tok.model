also  the discussion which follows contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed above under the caption risk factors 

table of contents executive summary we are one of the largest independent owners and operators of full service hotels in the united states in terms of our number of guest rooms  as reported by hotel business in the green book issue published in december we are considered an independent owner and operator because we do not operate our hotels under our own name 
we operate substantially all of our hotels under nationally recognized brands  such as crowne plaza  holiday inn  marriott and hilton 
as of march   we operated hotels with an aggregate of  rooms  located in states and canada 
of the hotels we operated as of march   hotels  with an aggregate of  rooms  are part of our continuing operations  while eight hotels  with an aggregate of  rooms  are held for sale 
five of the eight hotels  with an aggregate of rooms  were classified as held for sale in the first two months of january and are  therefore  included in continuing operations at december  our portfolio of hotels  all of which we consolidate in our financial statements  consists of hotels that we wholly own and operate through subsidiaries  and four hotels that we operate in joint ventures in which we have a or greater equity interest and exercise control 
in  we developed a strategy of owning and operating a portfolio of profitable  well maintained and appealing hotels at superior locations in strong markets 
we have implemented this strategy by renovating and repositioning certain of our existing hotels to improve performance  divesting hotels that do not fit this strategy or that are unlikely to do so without significant effort or expense  and acquiring one hotel that better fits this strategy 
in accordance with this strategy  and our efforts to reduce debt and interest costs  in we identified hotels  our only office building and three land parcels for sale 
in  we sold one hotel and the office building 
in  we sold hotels and two land parcels 
in  we sold hotels 
in  we also identified an additional five hotels as held for sale 
in the first two months of  we identified an additional five hotels as held for sale 
since the start of our portfolio improvement strategy in november  we have listed hotels  one office building and three land parcels for sale and we have sold hotels  two land parcels and the office building 
the total aggregate sales price of these sales was million and  of the million in aggregate net proceeds  we used million to pay down debt and the balance for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures 
one hotel previously included in discontinued operations was reclassified into continuing operations in the fourth quarter as management no longer expected the hotel to be sold within one year 
additionally  on february   our two kansas properties were surrendered to the trustee pursuant to the settlement agreement signed in august on february   our minority owned hotel in columbus  oh  accounted for under the equity method of accounting  was deeded to the lender 
as detailed below  after the surrender of these three hotels in the first two months of and the identification of five additional hotels as held for sale in the first two months of  as of march   our portfolio consisted of hotels  with hotels in continuing operations and eight hotels and one land parcel in discontinued operations 
continuing discontinued operations operations total hotel count in portfolio as of december  hotels identified for sale in first quarter two kansas hotels surrendered to trustee columbus hotel deeded to lender hotel count in portfolio as of march  
table of contents operating summary below is a summary of our results of operations  presented in more detail in results of operations continuing operations revenues increased in due to improved performance in occupancy and adr  mostly driven by increases in room rate 
revenues for were negatively affected by the rooms that were displaced by our renovation program  the impact of two hotels that were closed for the balance of for hurricane repairs with the exception of the crowne plaza west palm beach that reopened on december   and the closure of one hotel in the fourth quarter for repairs related to a water main break  direct operating expenses increased due to increased revenues and the corresponding increase in variable expenses such as franchise fees which increase with revenues 
other hotel operating costs increased due to data conversion and training costs for property management system upgrades mandated by our franchisors  higher bad debts related to airline chapter filings  higher advertising and promotion costs related to our newly renovated properties including our two hurricane damaged properties that reopened in december and january  and significantly higher utility rates  corporate and other expenses were higher in due to severance costs  expenses related to the hiring of the company s president and chief executive officer  the write off of a receivable from and the investment in the minority owned holiday inn city center columbus  oh hotel  and legal and settlement fees surrounding the two kansas hotels that were surrendered to the bond trustee  during  we reached a settlement with our insurance carriers on the property damage related to the hurricane season and  as a result  recognized a net casualty gain on five hotels offset by additional hurricane expenses at our radisson new orleans airport hotel and other continuing operations hotels 
we also recognized business interruption proceeds for the two florida hotels that were closed for hurricane repairs  interest expense decreased in as compared to because we incurred significant charges related to the refinancing executed in connection with our secondary stock offering completed on june   and during  we analyzed our assets held for use for conditions of impairment and  where appropriate  recorded impairment charges where the carrying values exceeded their estimated fair values 
our analysis included such factors as cash flow  negative demographic or economic factors in each market and increased guest room supply in each market 
discontinued operations at december   three hotels and one land parcel were held for sale 
at december   seven hotels and one parcel of land were held for sale 
the combined condensed statement of operations for discontinued operations as of december  includes the results of operations for the three hotels and one land parcel held for sale and the eight hotels that were sold in the combined condensed statement of operations for discontinued operations as of december  includes the results of operations for the seven hotels and one land parcel held for sale  the hotels that were sold in and the eight hotels sold in the assets and liabilities related to these held for sale assets are separately disclosed in our consolidated balance sheet 
where the carrying values of the assets held for sale exceeded their estimated fair values  net of selling costs  we reduced the carrying values and recorded impairment charges 
fair values were determined using market prices and where the estimated selling prices  net of selling costs  exceeded the carrying values  no adjustments were recorded 
we classify an asset as held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market a property for sale 
while we believe the completion of these dispositions is 
table of contents probable  the sale of these assets is subject to market conditions and we cannot provide assurance that we will finalize the sale of all or any of these assets on favorable terms or at all 
between november  and march   we sold hotels  our only office building and two land parcels for aggregate net proceeds of million  of which we used million to pay down debt and the balance for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures 
for the eight assets sold in  the total revenues for the year ended december  were million  the direct operating expenses were million  and the other hotel operating expenses were million 
the results of operations of the other hotels that we consolidate in our consolidated financial statements are reported in continuing operations as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
as we prepare our financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies and estimates consolidation policy all of our hotels are owned by operating subsidiaries 
we consolidate the assets  liabilities and results of operations of those hotels where we own at least of the voting equity interest and we exercise control 
all of the subsidiaries are wholly owned except for five joint ventures  one of which is not consolidated but is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
when we consolidate hotels in which we own less than of the voting equity interest  we include the assets and liabilities of these hotels in our consolidated balance sheet 
the third party interests in the net assets of these hotels are reported as minority interest on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  our consolidated statement of operations reflects the full revenues and expenses of these hotels and the third party portion of the net income or loss is reported as minority interest in our consolidated statements of operations 
if the loss applicable to the minority interest exceeds the minority s equity  we report the entire loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
when we account for an entity under the equity method of accounting  we record only our share of the investment on our consolidated balance sheet and our share of the net income or loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
we own a non controlling equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture and have historically included our share of this investment in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
our share of the net income or loss of the unconsolidated joint venture is shown in interest income and other in our consolidated statements of operations 
in the third quarter we wrote off the investment in this minority owned hotel as we had plans to surrender this hotel to its lender 
deferral policy we defer franchise application fees on the acquisition or renewal of a franchise as well as loan origination costs related to new or renewed loan financing arrangements 
deferrals relating to the acquisition or renewal of a franchise are amortized on a straight line basis over the period of the franchise agreement 
we amortize deferred financing costs over the term of the loan using the effective interest method 
the effective interest method incorporates the present values of future cash outflows and the effective yield on the debt in determining the amortization of loan fees 
at december   these deferrals totaled million for our continuing operations hotels 
if we were to write these expenses off in the year of payment  our operating expenses in those years would be significantly higher 
asset impairment we invest significantly in real estate assets 
property and equipment represent of the total assets on our consolidated balance sheet at december  accordingly  our policy on asset impairment is considered a critical accounting estimate 
under gaap  real estate assets are stated at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value  if deemed impaired 
management periodically evaluates the company s property and equipment to determine whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that a possible 
table of contents impairment in the carrying values of the assets has occurred 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered for impairment when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by that asset over its estimated useful life is less than the asset s carrying amounts 
in determining the undiscounted cash flows we consider the current operating results  market trends  and future prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
if it is determined that an impairment has occurred  the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value is charged to operating expenses 
we obtain fair values through broker valuations or appraisals 
these broker valuations of fair value normally use the cap rate approach of estimated cash flows  a per key valuation approach  or a room revenue multiplier approach for determining fair value 
if the projected future cash flow exceeds the asset s carrying values  no adjustment is recorded 
impairment loss for an asset held for sale is recognized when the asset s carrying value is greater than the fair value less estimated selling costs 
see note for further discussion of the company s charges for asset impairment 
as part of this evaluation  and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 we classify our properties into two categories  assets held for sale and assets held for use 
we consider an asset held for sale when the following criteria per sfas no 
are met management commits to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition  an active marketing plan to sell the asset has been initiated at a reasonable price  the sale of the asset is probable within one year  and it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan to sell the asset will be made 
upon designation of an asset as held for sale  we record the carrying value of the asset at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value which is determined after consultation with real estate brokers less estimated selling costs  and we cease depreciation of the asset 
the fair values of the assets held for sale are based on the estimated selling prices 
we determine the estimated selling prices in conjunction with real estate brokers 
the estimated selling costs are based on our experience with similar asset sales 
we record impairment charges and write down respective hotel assets if their carrying values exceed the estimated selling prices less costs to sell 
during  we recorded million of impairment losses on six assets held for sale 
during  we recorded million of impairment losses on seven hotels and two land parcels held for sale 
with respect to assets held for use  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by these assets 
we then compare the estimated undiscounted cash flows for each hotel with their respective carrying values to determine if there are indicators of impairment 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered for impairment when the undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset over its estimated useful life is less than the asset s carrying value 
for those assets where there are indicators of impairment  we determine the estimated fair values of these assets using broker valuations or appraisals 
the broker valuations of fair value normally use the cap rate approach of estimated cash flows  a per key approach or a room revenue multiplier approach for determining fair value 
if the projected future cash flow exceeds the assets carrying value  no adjustment is recorded 
during  we recorded million of impairment losses  with million on six hotels held for use and million for net book value write offs for held for use assets that were replaced in and had remaining book value 
during  we recorded million of impairment losses with million in adjustments made to the carrying value on two hotels and million for net book value write offs for assets that were replaced in that had remaining book value 
accrual of self insured obligations we are self insured up to certain amounts with respect to employee medical  employee dental  property insurance  general liability insurance  personal injury claims  workers compensation  automobile liability and other coverages 
we establish reserves for our estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims as well as estimates for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
our reserves  which are reflected in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  are based on actuarial valuations and our history of claims 
our actuaries incorporate historical loss experience 
table of contents and judgments about the present and expected levels of costs per claim 
trends in actual experience are an important factor in the determination of these estimates 
we believe that our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  however  actual experience in claim frequency and amount could materially differ from our estimates and adversely affect our results of operations  cash flow  liquidity and financial condition 
as of december   we had an accrued balance of million for these expenses 
income statement overview the discussion below focuses primarily on our continuing operations 
in the continuing operations discussions  we compare the results of operations for the last three years for consolidated hotels that as of december  are classified as assets held for use 
revenues we categorize our revenues into the following three categories room revenues derived from guest room rentals  food and beverage revenues derived from hotel restaurants  room service  hotel catering and meeting room rentals  and other revenues derived from guests long distance telephone usage  laundry services  parking services  in room movie services  vending machine commissions  leasing of hotel space and other miscellaneous revenues 
transient revenues  which generally account for approximately of room revenues  are revenues derived from individual guests who stay only for brief periods of time without a long term contract 
demand from groups makes up approximately of our room revenues while our contract revenues such as contracts with airlines for crew rooms account for the remaining 
we believe revenues in the hotel industry are best explained by the following four key performance indicators occupancy computed by dividing total room nights sold by the total available room nights  average daily rate adr computed by dividing total room revenues by total room nights sold  and revenue per available room revpar computed by dividing total room revenues by total available room nights 
revpar can also be obtained by multiplying the occupancy by the adr 
revpar index computed by dividing lodgian s revpar performance by the industry or market revpar performance which is a measure of market share 
to obtain available room nights for a year  we multiply the number of rooms in our portfolio by the number of days in the year 
to obtain available room nights for a hotel sold during the year  we multiply the number of rooms in the hotel by the number of days between january and the date the hotel was sold 
we have adjusted available rooms accordingly  for the crowne plaza melbourne  fl hotel  which was closed throughout due to hurricane renovations  the crowne plaza west palm beach  fl hotel that reopened december  after the completion of its hurricane repairs  and the clarksburg  wv hotel  which closed in october as a result of damage caused from a water main break 
the hotel reopened on january  these measures are influenced by a variety of factors including national  regional and local economic conditions  the degree of competition with other hotels in the area and changes in travel patterns 
the demand for accommodations is also affected by normally recurring seasonal patterns and most of our hotels experience lower occupancy levels in the fall and winter months  november through february  which generally results in lower revenues  lower net income and less cash flow during these months 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses fall into the following categories direct expenses these expenses tend to vary with available rooms and occupancy 
however  hotel level expenses contain significant elements of fixed costs and  therefore  do not decline proportionately with revenues 
direct expenses are further categorized as follows room expenses expenses incurred in generating room revenues  food and beverage expenses expenses incurred in generating food and beverage revenues  and other direct expenses expenses incurred in generating the revenue activities classified in other revenue  other hotel operating expenses these expenses include salaries for hotel management  advertising and promotion  franchise fees  repairs and maintenance and utilities  property and other taxes  insurance and leases these expenses include equipment  ground and building rentals  insurance  and property  franchise and other taxes  corporate and other these expenses include corporate salaries and benefits  legal  accounting and other professional fees  directors fees  costs for office space and information technology costs 
also included are costs related to compliance with sarbanes oxley legislation  casualty gains losses  net these expenses include hurricane repair costs and charges related to the assets written off that were damaged during the and hurricane seasons  netted again any gains realized on the final settlement of our property damage claims  depreciation and amortization depreciation of fixed assets primarily hotel assets and amortization of deferred franchise fees  and impairment of long lived assets charges which were required to write down the carrying values of long term assets to their fair values on assets where the undiscounted cash flows over the life of the asset were less than the carrying value of the asset 
non operating items non operating items include business interruption insurance proceeds represent proceeds from our insurance company for lost profits as a result of a business shutdown 
our business interruption proceeds relate to the recovery of lost profits and reimbursement for additional expenses incurred as a result of hurricane damage sustained during the hurricane season  interest expense and other financing costs includes preferred stock dividend  interest expense which includes amortization of deferred loan costs  and loss on preferred stock redemption  interest income  our share of the income or loss of our non controlling equity interest in one hotel  for which we account under the equity method of accounting for and prior years but which we wrote off in as the hotel was surrendered to the lender on november   and minority interests our equity partners share of the income or loss of the four hotels owned by joint ventures that we consolidate

estimated full year room and total revenue displacement for the crowne plaza west palm beach  fl and crowne plaza melbourne  fl hotels  as calculated in the business interruption claims  are million and million 
revenue is considered displaced only when a hotel has sold all available rooms and denies additional reservations due to rooms being out of order 
we feel this method is conservative  as it does not include estimated other or soft displacement associated with a renovation  for example  guests who depart earlier than planned due to the disruption caused by the renovation work  local customers or frequent guests who may choose an alternative hotel during the renovation  or local groups that may not solicit the hotel to house their groups during renovations

we made substantial progress on our renovation program in  but with many rooms out of service while under renovation  we experienced substantial room revenue displacement

we then compare the estimated undiscounted cash flows for each hotel with their respective carrying values to determine if there are indicators of impairment 
if there are indicators of impairment  we determine the estimated fair values of these assets in conjunction with real estate brokers 
these broker valuations of fair value normally use the cap rate approach of estimated cash flows  a per key valuation approach  or a room revenue multiplier approach for determining fair value 
as a result of these evaluations  we recorded impairment charges in as follows a million on the park inn brunswick  ga hotel  which was converted from a holiday inn  as this hotel lost the business of a significant military group contract and the conversion of this hotel to a park inn was not expected to improve operating results  and b million on the holiday inn lawrence  ks hotel as the financial performance of this hotel continued to decline as it is in need of a major renovation which is not economically justifiable as management was notified the franchise agreement would not be renewed

ebitda is a non gaap measure and should not be used as a substitute for measures such as net income loss  cash flows from operating activities  or other measures computed in accordance with gaap

we expect these variations to continue for a variety of reasons  primarily seasonality 
due to the fixed nature of certain expenses  such as marketing and rent  our operating expenses do not vary as significantly from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources working capital we use our cash flows primarily for operating expenses  debt service  and capital expenditures 
currently  our principal sources of liquidity consist of cash flows from operations  proceeds of insurance claims relating principally to damage caused by the and hurricanes and existing cash balances 
additionally  on march   we completed the refinance of three other hotels  all of which had higher than current market rate mortgages and received excess proceeds of million 
cash flows from operations may be adversely affected by factors such as a reduction in demand for lodging or displacement from large scale renovations being performed at our hotels 
to the extent that significant amounts of our accounts receivable are due from airline companies  a further downturn in the airline industry also could materially and adversely affect the collectibility of our accounts receivable  and hence our liquidity 
at december   airline receivables represented approximately of our 
table of contents accounts receivable  net of allowances 
a further downturn in the airline industry could also affect our revenues by decreasing the aggregate levels of demand for travel 
we expect that the sale of certain assets will provide additional cash to pay down outstanding debt  fund a portion of our capital expenditures and provide additional working capital 
eight hotels were sold in at december   we had three hotels and one land parcel classified as held for sale 
in the first two months of we identified an additional five hotels for sale 
as of march   we had eight hotels and one land parcel as held for sale 
of the hotels  two land parcels and the office building that were sold between november  and march   the aggregate net proceeds received from these sales were million  of which million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes including capital expenditures 
our ability to make scheduled debt service payments and fund operations and capital expenditures depends on our future performance and financial results  the successful implementation of our business strategy and  to a certain extent  the general condition of the lodging industry and the general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory environment 
in addition  our ability to refinance our indebtedness depends to a certain extent on these factors as well 
many factors affecting our future performance and financial results  including the severity and duration of macro economic downturns  are beyond our control 
see item a  risk factors 
we intend to continue to use our cash flow to make scheduled debt service payments and fund operations and capital expenditures and build cash reserves and  therefore  do not currently have plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
on june   we completed the final distribution of shares and cash to general unsecured creditors in connection with the conclusion of our bankruptcy claim distribution process 
because our final distribution was less than the liability established at the time of the stock offering to pay such claims  we have relieved the excess liability related to the bankruptcy claims and credited additional paid in capital 
we do not anticipate any additional material charges related to our chapter bankruptcy filing 
in accordance with gaap  all assets held for sale  including assets that would normally be classified as long term assets in the normal course of business  were reported as assets held for sale in current assets 
similarly  all liabilities related to assets held for sale were reported as liabilities related to assets held for sale in current liabilities  including debt that would otherwise be classified as long term liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
at december   we had working capital current assets less current liabilities of million compared to million at december  the increase in working capital was primarily to the result of the refinancings of our holiday inn hilton head  sc hotel  which generated approximately million of net proceeds in excess of the payoff of the old loan and the refinance of our holiday inn phoenix west  az hotel  which generated approximately million of net proceeds in excess of the payoff of the old loan 
two of our hotels  the quality inn conference center in metairie  la and the radisson new orleans airport hotel in kenner  la  were damaged by hurricane katrina in august the quality inn conference center in metairie  la is held for sale and is included in discontinued operations and is currently open for business 
the radisson new orleans airport hotel is included in our continuing operations and is currently open for business 
the insurance deductible on the quality inn conference center metairie  la is million and million on the radisson new orleans airport hotel 
eight of our hotels were damaged by the hurricanes that hit the southeastern united states in august and september as of december  we had received million in advances for damage related to the radisson new orleans airport hotel kenner  la and million related to the quality inn conference center metairie  la 
two hotels  the crowne plaza west palm beach  fl and the crowne plaza melbourne  fl hotels  suffered extensive damage and were closed for renovation in september the crowne plaza west palm beach  fl reopened on december  and the melbourne property reopened as a crowne plaza on january  in the fourth quarter we settled the property damage claims on five hotels including the crowne plaza west palm beach  fl  holiday inn melbourne  fl which converted to a crowne plaza  holiday inn winter haven  fl  holiday inn pensacola  fl and holiday inn express pensacola  fl 
the settlement of the property claims for these five hotels resulted in a casualty gain of million  offset by hurricane 
table of contents repair expenses of million on the radisson new orleans airport hotel kenner  la and other continuing operations hotels 
approximately million was spent on the repair and renovation of these hotels and we received proceeds for this property damage totaling approximately million through march  we have recorded million in business interruption proceeds for the crowne plaza west palm beach  fl and the crowne plaza melbourne  fl hotels 
for the crowne plaza west palm beach  fl hotel  million was recorded for the period september through november for the crowne plaza melbourne  fl hotel  million was recorded for the period september through december we had received million in proceeds or had signed proofs of loss for million which we established as a receivable from the insurance company as of december  at december   million was included on our consolidated balance sheet for receivables related to business interruption proceeds 
at december   we had million of liabilities for insurance advances on our continuing operations balance sheet related to outstanding insurance claims 
of this amount  million relates to the crowne plaza west palm beach  fl for an open mold policy claim from the hurricane season that has not yet been finalized and million related to our radisson new orleans airport hotel claim for hurricane katrina 
in our discontinued operations  we are carrying a liability of million for insurance advances for our claim related to the quality inn conference center metairie  la hotel from hurricane katrina 
for the year ended december   we spent approximately million on capital expenditures for our continuing operations  which includes million for hurricane repairs and million on our discontinued operations 
during  we expect to spend million in capital expenditures for our hotels  which includes committed hurricane repair capital expenditures of approximately million 
we believe that the combination of our current cash  cash flows from operations  capital expenditure escrows and asset sales will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next months 
our ability to meet our long term cash needs is dependent on the continuation and extent of the recovery of the economy and the lodging industry  improved operating results  the successful implementation of our portfolio improvement strategy and our ability to obtain third party sources of capital on favorable terms when and as needed 
in the short term  we continue to diligently monitor our costs 
our future financial needs and sources of working capital are  however  subject to uncertainty  and we can provide no assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity to be able to meet our operating expenses  debt service requirements  including scheduled maturities  and planned capital expenditures 
we could lose the right to operate certain hotels under nationally recognized brand names  and furthermore  the termination of one or more franchise agreements could trigger defaults and acceleration under one or more loan agreements as well as obligations to pay liquidated damages under the franchise agreements if we are unable to find a suitable replacement franchisor 
see item a risk factor for further discussion of conditions that could adversely affect our estimates of future liquidity needs and sources of working capital

we may  after the earlier of months after the closing of any fixed rate loan or the second anniversary of the securitization of any fixed rate loan  defease such fixed rate loan  in whole or in part 
on april   we entered into an amendment with merrill lynch to modify certain of the provisions of the floating rate loan 
under the terms of the amendment  merrill lynch agreed to allow the release of the holiday inn st 
louis  mo as collateral under the loan in exchange for debt paydown of million 
approximately million of this amount was paid through the release of certain reserves held on other properties which were sold or were expected to be sold in the near future 
we paid the balance of the release price  approximately million  from our cash balances 
in addition to the release of the st 
louis property from the collateral pool  the amendment provided for the following extension of the initial maturity from june  to january  we still maintain the option  subject to certain conditions  to extend the loan for up to three years from the new initial maturity date in january three additional properties in the floating rate pool are now classified as sale properties 
once classified as sale properties a hotel will be able to be released from the collateral pool by payment of the greater of a of the aggregate allocated loan amount lowered from and b the net sales proceeds of the property  the prepayment penalty dropped to in july and has been further reduced for the three additional sale properties after july to  and certain required capital and environmental repairs under the original floating rate loan have been determined not to be necessary and have been removed as requirements under the loan 
as a result of these modifications in the terms of the floating rate loan  the floating rate debt has an initial maturity of january the floating rate debt is a year loan including the six month extension with three one year extension options and bears interest at libor plus 
the first extension option will be available to us only if no defaults exist and we have entered into the requisite interest rate cap agreement

each loan comprising the refinancing debt is non recourse  however  we have agreed to indemnify merrill lynch mortgage in certain situations  such as fraud  waste  misappropriation of funds  certain environmental matters  asset transfers in violation of the loan agreements  or violation of certain single purpose entity covenants 
in addition  each loan comprising the refinancing debt will become full recourse in certain limited cases such as bankruptcy of a borrower or lodgian 
during the term of the refinancing debt  we are required to fund  on a monthly basis  a reserve for furniture  fixtures and equipment equal to of the previous month s gross revenues from the hotels securing each of the respective loans comprising the refinancing debt

this amount is being amortized using the effective yield method over the remaining life of the debt 
column financial debt as of december  and december   the company was not in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio requirement of the loan from column financial secured by one of its hotels in phoenix  arizona 
the primary reason why the debt service coverage ratio is below the required threshold is due to the property undergoing an extensive renovation in and the first quarter of in order to convert from a holiday inn select to a crowne plaza 
the renovation caused substantial revenue displacement which  in turn  negatively affected the financial performance of this hotel 
under the terms of the column financial loan agreement until the required dscr is met  the lender is permitted to require the borrower to deposit all revenues from the mortgaged property into an account controlled by the lender 
the company was notified by the lender in december that it was in default of the debt service coverage ratio and would have to establish a restricted cash account whereby all cash generated by the property be deposited in an account from which all payments of interest  principal  operating expenses and impounds insurance  property taxes and ground rent would be disbursed 
the lender may apply excess proceeds after payment of expenses to additional principal payments 
at december   million was being retained in this restricted cash account 
notice of repayment has been given to the existing lender as this loan is currently in the process of being refinanced 
on march   this mortgage was refinanced and  as such  this non compliance issue has been resolved 
see note subsequent events 
other financings as of december   through our wholly owned subsidiaries  we owed approximately million under industrial revenue bonds secured by the holiday inns lawrence  kansas and manhattan  kansas hotels 
for the year ended december   the cash flows of the two hotels were insufficient to meet the minimum debt service coverage ratio requirements 
on march   we notified the trustee of the industrial revenue bonds which finance the holiday inns in lawrence  kansas and manhattan  kansas that we would not continue to make debt service payments 
we reclassified this debt to current liabilities because the debt became callable on march   when we did not make the march  debt service payment 
on february   we surrendered the holiday inn manhattan  ks and the holiday inn lawrence  ks hotels  respectively  to the bond trustee  and we no longer own or operate these hotels 
on november   the company entered into a million loan agreement with ixis real estate capital inc ixis which is secured by the holiday inn hilton head  sc hotel 
the loan agreement has a 
table of contents two year initial term with three one year extension options which are exercisable provided the loan is not in default 
the loan has a debt service coverage ratio requirement of x which is calculated quarterly 
the loan bears a floating rate of interest which is basis points above the day libor 
contemporaneously with the closing of the loan we purchased an interest rate cap agreement that effectively caps our interest rate for the first two years of the loan agreement at 
prior to entering into the loan agreement with ixis  the holiday inn hilton head  sc hotel served as part of the collateral  along with eight other hotels  under a loan agreement with column financial  inc the column financial loan agreement bears a fixed rate of interest of 
million of the ixis loan proceeds were used to pay down existing indebtedness under the column financial loan 
prior to the debt paydown  we were not in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio of the column financial loan 
after the debt paydown  the debt service coverage ratio is above the required threshold 
as of november   the principal balance of the column financial loan is million and is now secured by eight of the company s hotels 
the ixis loan agreement is non recourse to lodgian  inc  except in certain limited circumstances as set forth in the loan agreement

franchise agreements and capital expenditures we benefit from the superior brand qualities of crowne plaza  holiday inn  marriott  hilton and other brands 
included in the benefits of these brands are their reputation for quality and service  revenue generation through their central reservation systems  access to revenue through the global distribution systems  guest loyalty programs and brand internet booking sites 
reservations made by means of these franchisor facilities generally account for approximately of our total reservations 
to obtain these franchise affiliations  we enter into franchise agreements with hotel franchisors that generally have terms of between and years 
the franchise agreements typically authorize us to operate the hotel under the franchise name  at a specific location or within a specified area  and require that we operate the hotel in accordance with the standards specified by the franchisor 
as part of our franchise agreements  we are generally required to pay a royalty fee  an advertising marketing fee  a fee for the use of the franchisor s nationwide reservation system and certain other ancillary charges 
royalty fees range from to of gross room revenues  advertising marketing fees range from to  reservation system fees range from 
table of contents to and club and restaurant fees from to 
in the aggregate  royalty fees  advertising marketing fees  reservation fees and other ancillary fees for the various brands under which we operate our hotels range from to of gross room revenues 
these costs vary with revenues and are not fixed commitments 
franchise fees incurred which are reported in other hotel operating costs on our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december   and in thousands continuing operations discontinued operations during the term of the franchise agreements  the franchisors may require us to upgrade facilities to comply with their current standards 
our current franchise agreements terminate at various times and have differing remaining terms 
for example  the terms of  eight and nine of our franchise agreements are scheduled to expire in   and  respectively 
as franchise agreements expire  we may apply for a franchise renewal or request a franchise extension 
in connection with renewals  the franchisor may require payment of a renewal fee  increased royalty and other recurring fees and substantial renovation of the facilities  or the franchisor may elect not to renew the franchise 
the costs incurred in connection with these agreements are primarily monthly payments due to the franchisors based on a percentage of room revenues 
if we do not comply with the terms of a franchise agreement  following notice and an opportunity to cure  the franchisor has the right to terminate the agreement  which could lead to a default under one or more of our loan agreements  and which could materially and adversely affect us 
prior to terminating a franchise agreement  franchisors are required to notify us of the areas of non compliance and give us the opportunity to cure the non compliance 
in the past  we have been able to cure most cases of non compliance and most defaults within the cure periods  and those events of non compliance and defaults did not cause termination of our franchises or defaults on our loan agreements 
if we perform an economic analysis of the hotel and determine that it is not economically feasible to comply with a franchisor s requirements  we will either select an alternative franchisor  operate the hotel without a franchise affiliation or sell the hotel 
however  terminating or changing the franchise affiliation of a hotel could require us to incur significant expenses  including liquidated damages  and capital expenditures 
our loan agreements generally prohibit a hotel from operating without a franchise 
as of march   we have been notified that we were not in compliance with some of the terms of eight of our franchise agreements and have received default and termination notices from franchisors with respect to an additional seven hotels summarized as follows six hotels are held for sale 
two of these hotels are in default of their respective franchise agreement for failure to complete their property improvement plan pip 
four additional hotels are in default or in non compliance of their respective franchise agreements for not maintaining required guest satisfaction scores 
each of these hotels requires a significant capital investment for which we do not anticipate a sufficient return on our investment 
we have entered into a forbearance agreement with the franchisor regarding one of these hotels that is in default which will maintain the flag until the earlier of march  or until we sell the hotel 
we plan to enter into a voluntary termination agreement with the franchisor regarding two of these hotels which will maintain the flag until the earlier of june  or until we sell the hotels 
one hotel was held for sale but was reclassified into continuing operations in the fourth quarter as management no longer expected to have the hotel sold within one year due to issues related to the transfer of the ground lease to a prospective buyer 
this hotel is in default of its franchise agreement for not maintaining required guest satisfaction scores and has a license termination date of february  we may be subject to liquidated damages 
we have entered into a letter of intent to sell this 
table of contents hotel to a joint venture in which we will be a minority owner 
however  we will no longer continue to operate the hotel 
one hotel has received an extension to its default termination date until august  the franchisor has verbally agreed to our planned renovations of two floors of guestrooms and guestroom corridors 
this work began on january  and will take approximately days to complete 
we anticipate the renovations will assist us in improving the quest product scores 
seven hotels are in default or non compliance of their respective franchise agreement because of substandard guest satisfaction or quality scores 
three of these hotels are trending above the required thresholds  however  they must remain above that threshold for two consecutive years to earn a clean slate letter 
we anticipate these three hotels will earn their clean slate letters in august  august and february  respectively 
two of these hotels are awaiting follow up quality inspections by the franchisor to cure the non compliance issues 
two of these hotels have entered into the non compliance status due to a new measurement process implemented in january by the franchisor 
one of these hotels in non compliance recently received an up branding renovation 
the scores used to determine this non compliance were done before the pre renovation and we anticipate curing this non compliance as the new scores begin to cycle in 
our corporate operations team  as well as each property s general manager and associates  have focused their efforts to cure these failures through enhanced service  increased cleanliness  and product improvements by the required cure date 
if we do not achieve scores above required thresholds by the designated date  the hotel would be subject to default of its franchise agreement 
each hotel would receive another opportunity to improve its score before the hotel would be at the risk of having its franchise agreement terminated 
we believe that we will cure the non compliance and defaults as to which our franchisors have given us notice before the applicable termination dates  but we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to do so or that we will be able to obtain additional time in which to do so 
if a franchise agreement is terminated  we will either select an alternative franchisor or operate the hotel independently of any franchisor 
however  terminating or changing the franchise affiliation of a hotel could require us to incur significant expenses  including franchise termination payments and capital expenditures  and in certain circumstances could lead to acceleration of parts of our indebtedness 
this could adversely affect us 
we believe we are in compliance with our other franchise agreements in all material aspects 
while we can give no assurance that the steps taken to date  and planned to be taken during  will return these properties to full compliance  we believe that we will make significant progress and we intend to continue to give franchise agreement compliance a high level of attention 
the hotels that are either in default or non compliance under the respective franchise agreements are part of the collateral security for an aggregate of million of mortgage debt at march  in addition  as part of our bankruptcy reorganization proceedings  we entered into stipulations with each of our major franchisors setting forth a timeline for completion of capital expenditures for some of our hotels 
however  as of march   we have not completed the required capital expenditures for eight continuing operations hotels in accordance with the stipulations and estimate that completing those improvements will cost million 
as of march   approximately million is deposited in escrow with our lenders to be applied to these capital expenditure obligations pursuant to the terms of the respective loan agreements with these lenders 
under the stipulations  the applicable franchisors could therefore seek to declare certain franchise agreements in default and  in certain circumstances  seek to terminate the franchise agreement 
we have scheduled or have begun renovations on eight of these hotels  aggregating million of the million 
during  we entered into new franchise agreements for all of our marriott branded hotels at that time and agreed to pay a fee aggregating approximately million  of which million has been paid  and million is payable in  subject to offsets 
to improve our competitive position in individual markets  to comply with the requirements of our franchisors  and repair hurricane damaged hotels  we plan to spend million on our hotels in  which includes committed hurricane repair capital expenditures of approximately million 
this will substantially 
table of contents complete all of our deferred renovations 
we spent million on capital expenditures during on our continuing operations hotels including million for hurricane repairs 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas no 

the amendments made by sfas no 
are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
further  the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
sfas no 
is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
on july  did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued fas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
fas r supersedes apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no  statement of cash flows 
the approach in fas r is generally similar to the approach described in fas however  fas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the earnings statements based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure will no longer be an alternative 
we adopted fas r as of january  using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of fas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of fas for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
as permitted by fas  through december  we accounted for share based payments to employees using apb s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally have not recognized compensation cost for employee stock options 
we estimate that pretax compensation expense for stock options will range between million and million in in march  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin generally requires an entity to recognize a liability equal to the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred 
further  fin clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation 
fin is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
generally requires retrospective application for reporting a change in accounting principle  unless alternative transition methods are explicitly stated in a newly adopted accounting principle 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that errors be corrected by restating previously issued financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company began applying this standard on january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risks on our variable rate debt 
at december  and december   we had outstanding variable rate debt of approximately million and million  respectively 
on june   we refinanced both the merrill lynch exit financing and the lehman financing 
the new refinancing is organized in four fixed rate pools and one floating rate pool 
in order to manage our 
table of contents exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with the floating pool  we entered into a two year interest rate cap agreement  which allowed us to obtain this financing at a floating rate and effectively cap the interest rate at libor of plus 
when libor exceeds  the contract requires settlement of net interest receivable at specified intervals  which generally coincide with the dates on which interest is payable on the underlying debt 
when libor is below  there is no settlement from the interest rate cap 
we are exposed to interest rate risks on the floating pool for increases in libor up to but we are not exposed to increases in libor above because settlements from the interest rate caps would offset the incremental interest expense 
the notional principal amount of the interest rate cap outstanding was million at december  on november   we refinanced the mortgage on our holiday inn hilton head  sc property 
in order to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates with this loan  we entered into a month interest rate cap agreement  which allowed us to obtain the financing at a floating rate and effectively cap the interest at libor of plus 
when libor is below there is no settlement from the interest rate cap 
we are exposed to interest rate risks on this loan for increases in libor up to  but we are not exposed to increases in libor above because settlements from the interest rate caps would offset the incremental interest expense 
the notional principal amount of the interest rate cap outstanding was million at december  the fair value of the interest rate cap related to the refinancing debt as of december  was approximately  the fair value of the interest rate cap related to the holiday inn hilton head  sc loan was approximately  the fair values of the interest rate caps were recognized on the balance sheet in other assets 
adjustments to the carrying values of the interest rate caps are reflected in interest expense 
as a result of having our two interest rate caps  we believe that our interest rate risk at december  and december  was minimal 
the impact on annual results of operations of a hypothetical one point interest rate reduction on the interest rate caps as of december  would be a reduction in net income of approximately  these derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  we have not elected the hedging requirements of sfas no 
at december   approximately million of our outstanding debt instruments were subject to changes in libor 
without regard to additional borrowings under those instruments or scheduled amortization  the annualized effect of each twenty five basis point increase in libor would be a reduction in income before income taxes of approximately million 
the fair value of the fixed rate debt book value million at december  is estimated at million 
the nature of our fixed rate obligations does not expose us to fluctuations in interest payments 
the impact on the fair value of our fixed rate obligations of a hypothetical one point interest rate increase on the outstanding fixed rate debt as of december  would be approximately million
