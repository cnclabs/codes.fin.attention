overview and background we are a full service real estate operating company that owns  acquires  develops and manages office  retail and multi family properties on a nationwide basis 
we conduct our business through our operating partnership  of which we own and have control over the major decisions of the operating partnership 
during the period from our formation until we commenced operations upon consummation of our offering on october   we did not have any material corporate activity 
because we believe that a discussion of the results of our company prior to the consummation of our offering would not be meaningful  we have set forth below a discussion of our results of operations beginning october  and tpgi predecessor s historical results of operations prior to that date 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the relevant reporting periods 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting estimates  as these policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
we believe the following accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
for a summary of significant accounting policies  see note to our financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
investments in real estate 
the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  the existence of above and below market tenant leases  the creditworthiness of the tenants  favorable or unfavorable financing  above or below market ground leases and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  any ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  tenant relationships  the value or negative value of above or below market leases and any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
our calculation methodology is summarized in note to our consolidated and combined financial statements 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases 
additionally  the amortization of value or negative value assigned to non market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated and combined statements of operations 

table of contents we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
we evaluate a property for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current book value of the property may not be recoverable 
in the event that these periodic assessments result in a determination that the carrying amount of a property exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest that are expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the property  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the property 
estimates of expected future net cash flows are inherently uncertain and are based on assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
these estimates require us to make assumptions relating to  among other things  future rental rates  tenant allowances  operating expenditures  property taxes  capital improvements  occupancy levels  and the estimated proceeds generated from the future sale of the property 
revenue recognition 
leases with tenants are accounted for as operating leases 
rental income is recognized as earned based upon the contractual terms of the leases with tenants 
minimum annual rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term regardless of when the payments are made 
the deferred rents asset on our balance sheets represents the aggregate excess rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the cash received under the applicable lease provisions 
our leases generally contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate related taxes associated with the property 
these reimbursements are recognized in the period the related expenses are incurred 
real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded as income after we satisfy all obligations under the commission agreement 
a typical commission agreement provides that we earn of the lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant 
the remaining of the lease commission is earned at a later date  usually upon tenant occupancy 
the existence of any significant future contingencies will delay recognition of commission revenue until those contingencies are satisfied 
investment advisory and property management fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related agreements 
development fees are recognized as the real estate development services are rendered  using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
allowances for uncollectible current tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rents receivable 
tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent receivables are carried net of the allowances for estimated uncollectible tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent 
our determination of the adequacy of these allowances requires significant judgments and estimates 
unbilled deferred rents receivable represents the amount that the cumulative straight line rental revenue recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the lease agreements 
given the longer term nature of these types of receivables  our determination of the adequacy of the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivables is based primarily on historical loss experience 
we evaluate the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivable using a specific identification methodology for our company s significant tenants  assessing a tenant s financial condition and the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations 
in addition  the allowance includes a reserve based upon our historical experience and current and anticipated future economic conditions that are not associated with any specific tenant 
depreciable lives of leasing costs 
we incur certain capital costs in connection with leasing our properties 
these costs consist primarily of lease commissions and tenant improvements 
lease costs are amortized on the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the estimated remaining term of the lease  ranging from one to years 
we reevaluate the remaining useful life of these costs as the creditworthiness of our tenants changes 
if we determine that the estimated remaining life of the respective lease has changed  we adjust the amortization period and  therefore  the amortization or depreciation expense recorded each period may fluctuate 
if we experience increased levels of amortization or depreciation expense due to changes in the estimated useful lives of leasing costs  our results of operations may be adversely affected 

table of contents income taxes 
we are subject to federal income taxes in the united states  and also in several states and local jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
in accordance with the criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  the company records tax contingencies when the exposure item becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
we assess the tax uncertainties on a quarterly basis and maintain the required tax reserves until the underlying issue is resolved or upon the expiration of the statute of limitations 
our estimate of potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
factors that may influence future results of operations the following is a summary of the more significant factors we believe may affect our results of operations 
for a more detailed discussion regarding the factors that you should consider before making a decision to acquire shares of our common stock  see the information under the caption risk factors elsewhere in this report 
rental income 
the amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space  to lease currently available space as well as space in newly developed or redeveloped properties and space available from unscheduled lease terminations 
the amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in the submarkets where our properties are located 
los angeles  philadelphia  and houston submarket information 
a significant portion of our income is derived from properties located in los angeles  philadelphia and houston 
the market conditions in these submarkets have a significant impact on our results of operations 
information regarding significant tenants conrail 
currently  our largest tenant portfolio wide is conrail 
conrail leased  rentable square feet of office space in two commerce square as of december  this lease represents of our consolidated annual rental and tenant reimbursements revenues for the year ended december  the lease has staggered expirations  with  square feet expiring in and the remaining  square feet expiring in we have entered into leases with tenants currently subleasing this space covering  square feet commencing  and  square feet commencing of the leases commencing and   square feet will expire in   square feet will expire in   square feet will expire in  and  square feet will expire in the lease expiring in has an early termination option in because of these direct leases  we believe we have mitigated some of the risks associated with the conrail tenant concentration 
development and redevelopment activities 
we believe that our development activities present growth opportunities for us over the next several years 
we continually evaluate the size  timing and scope of our development and redevelopment initiatives and  as necessary  sales activity to reflect the economic conditions and the real estate fundamentals that exist in our submarkets 
however  we may not be able to lease committed development or redevelopment properties at expected rental rates or within projected time frames or complete projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we currently own interests in three development projects  and our joint venture with calstrs includes redevelopment properties and a development site 
as of december   we had incurred  on a consolidated basis  approximately million in costs related to the three development projects 
to the extent that we  or joint ventures we are a partner in  do not proceed with projects as planned  development and or redevelopment costs would need to be evaluated for impairment

our requirement to fund all or a portion of this commitment is subject to our identifying properties to acquire that are mutually acceptable to us and calstrs 
we intend to declare and pay annual dividends on our common stock 
the availability of funds to pay dividends is impacted by property level restrictions on cash flows 
two commerce square is subject to debt financing covenants containing lock box arrangements 
funds generated by two commerce square cannot be distributed to us under the terms of the lock box arrangements established for the existing lenders for the property 
in addition  our joint venture with calstrs is subject to debt financing with a lockbox arrangement 
with respect to our joint venture properties  we do not control decision making with respect to these properties  and may not be able to obtain monies from these properties even if funds are available for distribution to us 
in addition  future financing arrangements we may enter into may contain restrictions on our use of cash generated from our properties 
development and redevelopment projects we currently own interests in three development projects and our joint venture with calstrs includes redevelopment properties and a development site 
we have considerable expertise in the completion of large scale development and redevelopment projects 
we anticipate developing these three development projects as market feasibility permits 
we also anticipate seeking to mitigate development risk by obtaining significant pre leasing and guaranteed maximum cost construction contracts 
there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully implement these risk mitigation measures 
the amount and timing of costs associated with our development and redevelopment projects is inherently uncertain due to market and economic conditions 
we presently intend to fund development and redevelopment expenditures primarily through construction or refurbishment financing 
in a parent of the entity that owns city national plaza refinanced the loan for city national plaza  which provides proceeds to cover the estimated future redevelopment costs for this property 
presently  we have not obtained construction financing for these three development projects 
if we finance the development projects through construction loans and are unable to obtain permanent financing on advantageous terms or at all  we would need to fund these obligations from cash flow from operations or seek alternative capital sources 
if unsuccessful  this could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations 
if we are successful in obtaining construction or refurbishment financing and permanent financing  we anticipate that the corresponding interest costs would represent both a significant use of our cash flow and a material component of our results of operations 
leasing  tenant improvement and capital needs in addition to our development and redevelopment projects  our company also owns majority interests in one commerce square and two commerce square 
these properties are substantially leased and have significant stabilized cash flows 
these properties require routine capital maintenance in the ordinary course of business 
the properties also require that we incur expenditures for leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs 
the level of these expenditures varies from year to year based on several factors  including lease expirations 
based upon historical expenditure levels  the leasing activity for the properties and the current rent roll  we anticipate incurring expenditures of approximately million in capital improvements  tenant improvements  and leasing costs for the one commerce square and two commerce square properties collectively during and

table of contents inflation substantially all of our office leases provide for tenants to reimburse us for increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses related to the leased space at the applicable property 
in addition  many of the leases provide for increases in fixed base rent 
we believe that inflationary increases may be partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense reimbursements as described above 
we have one multi family residential property and are considering other future multi family residential properties 
the existing residential property is located in the philadelphia central business district and subject to short term leases 
inflationary increases can often be offset by increased rental rates  however  a weak economic environment may restrict our ability to raise rental rates
