in june  the company exited its retail business activities which represented the company s sole source of revenue from continuing operations 
the company expects to consummate initial oem relationships in for the design of the company s ics and or technologies into mobile handsets 
however  based on the design cycle of these oems  the company anticipates that revenues from the mobile handset market in  if any  will not be significant  and will not be sufficient to offset its operating expenses 
the company intends to continue to use its working capital to support future marketing  sales  research and development and general operations 
no assurance can be given that such expenditures will result in revenues  new products  or technological advances or that the company has adequate capital to complete its products or gain market acceptance before requiring additional capital

the company s revenues in  and represent sales of its products primarily through retail distribution channels  with limited sales direct to end users through its own website and direct value added resellers 
retail distributors were generally given business terms that allowed for the return of unsold inventory 
in addition  the company offered a day money back guarantee on its products 
with regard to sales through a distribution channel where the right to return unsold product exists  the company recognized revenue on a sell through method utilizing information provided by the distribution channel 
in addition  since the company did not have sufficient history with sales of this nature to establish an estimate of expected returns  it recorded a return reserve in the amount of of product sales within the day guarantee period 
in addition to the reserve for sales returns  gross revenue was reduced for price protection programs  customer rebates and cooperative marketing expenses deemed to be sales incentives  to derive net revenue 
inventory valuation inventories  if any  are stated at the lower of cost as determined under the first in  first out method or market net realizable value 
cost includes the acquisition of purchased materials  labor and overhead 
purchased materials inventory consisted principally of components and subassemblies 
the company had an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the company recorded a million write down of inventory to net realizable value at june  and a million write down of inventory to net realizable value at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
these write downs are included as a separate deduction from gross margin in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations

accounting for stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
for employee stock option grants  no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
if the company applied the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  as amended by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  it would recognize stock based employee compensation of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the significant amount of employee based stock compensation is due to the substantial number of options granted under these plans as well as the factors impacting the fair value calculation  including high price volatility of the company s common stock 
the substantial decrease in employee based compensation from to is  in part  due to the completion of vesting in of options granted in and which had high fair market values due to the market value of the company s common stock at the time of grant 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  the company revised its estimate of forfeitures on previously issued grants to more accurately reflect actual forfeitures 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors  prototype expenses  maintenance costs for software development tools  depreciation  amortization  and a portion of facilities costs 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payment fas r which revises fas and requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
in addition to revising fas  fas r supersedes apb 
 and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
the provisions of fas r apply to awards that are granted  modified  or settled at the beginning of the annual reporting period that starts after june  the company will adopt fas r effective january  on a modified prospective basis without restatement of prior periods 
the company has determined that fas r will have a substantial impact on the financial statements of the company due to its requirement to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation in the company s consolidated statement of operations  thereby decreasing income and earnings per share 
the company anticipates that the impact of stock based compensation on based on current outstanding options that vest in future periods assuming no forfeitures or terminations is approximately  the substantial decrease in stock based compensation from  in to an estimated  for  is due to the completion of vesting in of options granted in which had a high fair market value due to the market value of the company s common stock at the time of grant 
future stock based compensation will be impacted by additional grants  forfeitures rates and stock price volatility  among other factors
