overview all of the operations of airtran holdings  inc are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  airtran airways  inc airways 
airways is one of the largest low cost scheduled airlines in the united states in terms of departures and seats offered 
we operate scheduled airline service primarily in short haul markets principally in the eastern united states  with a majority of our flights originating and terminating at our hub in atlanta  georgia 
as of march   we operated boeing b and boeing b aircraft making approximately scheduled flights per day to airports across the united states  serving more than communities in states  the district of columbia and the bahamas 
our plans for focus on continuing the growth of our operations 
we intend to do this by adding two new b and new b aircraft to our fleet  improving productivity  keeping our unit costs at levels that rank among the best in the industry  looking for new market opportunities that will satisfy the transportation needs of our customers  and providing our customers with a travel experience worth repeating 
we expect our mix of low fares  excellent customer service  an affordable business class product  and one of the youngest all boeing aircraft fleets will provide product value that customers will find attractive

index to financial statements year in review was another challenging year for the airline industry  the year was marked by intense competition  high energy prices  hurricanes  and capacity growth by airlines 
as a result we have seen three of our competitors enter bankruptcy with one competitor liquidating in early at one point during nearly half of all of the domestic us capacity was in bankruptcy 
despite the challenges of  we concluded the year as one of a few domestic passenger airlines to report a profit  recording million in net income for the year 
the revenue environment improved throughout as several carriers reduced capacity 
in our markets the competitive capacity reductions have been in the range of to year over year 
it is likely that further reductions in overall capacity will occur  including in the markets we serve 
our business model is based in part on low costs and our success in reducing costs has ensured our ability to persevere through the difficult economic environment we have faced  not only during but also during prior years as well 
our low costs have also given us a strategic advantage that allows us to grow profitably while our competitors have been unable to do the same 
as a result a number of airlines have incurred substantial losses in and are attempting to restructure their operations  gain wage concessions from their employees and lower their costs  including filing for bankruptcy protection 
highlights from include the following secured financing on all pre delivery purchase deposits through ratified agreements with our flight attendants and mechanics and inspectors named best low fare airline by entrepreneur magazine for initiated new service to richmond  indianapolis  charlotte  and detroit secured financing commitments for all aircraft deliveries received top faa recognition for maintenance excellence results of operations compared to summary we recorded operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per common share of for the year ended december  for the comparative period in  we recorded operating income of million  net income of million  and diluted earnings per common share of 
these results included million in other income expense  primarily related to payment of a break up fee to us in connection with our unsuccessful bid for certain leased gates and other assets of another airline at chicago s midway airport 
operating revenues our operating revenues for the twelve months ended december  increased million percent  primarily due to a percent increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues was largely due to a percent increase in passengers  as measured by revenue passenger miles rpms  and an increase in our average yield per rpm of percent to cents per rpm 
the increase in yield resulted primarily from a percent increase in our average fare to 
this increase in yield  when combined with our percentage point increase in passenger load factor  resulted in an percent increase in passenger unit revenues or passenger revenue available seat miles rasm to cents per asm

operating expenses our operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  increased million percent or percent on an asm basis 
our financial results were significantly affected by changes in the price of fuel 
during we experienced record high aircraft fuel prices driven by sharp increases in the cost of crude oil and disruptions to the gulf coast refineries as a result of hurricanes

our fuel price per gallon  including all fees and taxes  increased percent from for the twelve months ended december  to for twelve months ended december  the level of our flight operations  as measured by block hours flown  increased percent while our fuel consumption per block hour increased slightly percent to gallons 
in a continued effort to reduce our fuel costs  we have begun adding winglets to our b aircraft as they are delivered 
these enhancements extend the aircraft range  improve performance  and reduce fuel costs 
salaries  wages and benefits decreased percent on an asm basis  primarily due to gains in productivity driven by the increased number of aircraft and higher daily utilization 
we employed approximately  full time equivalent employees  as of december   representing a percent increase over the comparative period in maintenance  materials and repairs increased percent on an asm basis

under our maintenance agreements  we pay monthly charges based on either the number of flight hours flown or the number of landings 
aircraft insurance and security services decreased percent on an asm basis 
while the addition of new boeing aircraft to our fleet for the twelve month period ending december  increased our total insured hull value and related insurance premiums  the decrease on an asm basis is primarily due to a reduction in hull and liability insurance rates and security costs for our fleet coverage 
depreciation increased percent on an asm basis  primarily due to the addition of three b for the twelve month period ending december  as well as  the purchase of spare aircraft parts for the new b fleet 
with the exception of the three b s  all aircraft additions during the year were lease financed rather than purchased 
nonoperating income expense other income expense  net decreased by million percent 
increases in rates earned on cash and higher investment balances increased interest income by million 
interest expense increased by million and debt issuance cost amortization expense increased by million  primarily due to the issuance of new debt relating to new aircraft financing during the twelve months ended december  capitalized interest income increased million due to a million increase in progress payment balances on aircraft commitments in compared to additionally million of other income is included in our results relating to payment of a break up fee to us in connections with our unsuccessful bid for certain leased gates and other assets of another airline at chicago s midway airport 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate was percent and percent for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
our tax expense for december  includes a one time benefit of million resulting from an adjustment to our deferred tax liabilities for a decrease in our state effective rate 
the overall rate increase resulted primarily from permanent differences related to stock compensation 
at december  and  nol carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in management has determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected short term income  therefore no valuation allowance has been recorded at december  and compared to summary our performance during marked a major financial milestone we surpassed one billion dollars in total revenues for the year 
we recorded operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per common share of for the twelve months ended december  these results reflect a million net credit primarily related to our unsuccessful bid for certain leased gates and other assets of another airline at chicago s midway airport

index to financial statements operating revenues our operating revenues for the twelve months ended december  increased million percent  primarily due to a percent increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues was largely due to an percent increase in traffic  as measured by revenue passenger miles rpms  offset by a decrease in our average yield per rpm of percent to cents per rpm 
the decrease in yield resulted from a percent increase in our average passenger trip length to miles combined with a percent decrease in our average fare to 
this decrease in yield  when combined with our percentage point decrease in passenger load factor  resulted in a percent decrease in passenger unit revenues or passenger revenue available seat miles rasm to cents per asm 
we placed an order with an aircraft manufacturer in for up to aircraft  including options and purchase rights 
during the twelve months ended twelve months ended december   we took delivery of six b aircraft and eight b aircraft and retired one mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft 
as a result  our capacity  as measured by available seat miles asms  increased percent 
our traffic  as measured by rpms  increased percent  resulting in a percentage point decrease in passenger load factor to percent 
other revenues increased percent million  primarily due to fees earned from our airtran airways branded credit card issued by a third party financial institution  in addition to change and cancellation fees derived from our overall increase in traffic 
operating expenses our operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  increased million percent or increased percent on an asm basis

index to financial statements aircraft fuel  including fuel hedging activities  increased percent on an asm basis 
the cost of aircraft fuel reached then record highs during with our average per gallon cost  including all fees  taxes  and hedging activities increasing percent to cents 
our overall fuel consumption also increased percent primarily due to the growth of our operations 
improvements to our fuel consumption per block hour partially offset our greater fuel consumption and the record price increases 
our fuel consumption improved percent per block hour compared to our fuel performance improvements directly relate to our transition to an aircraft fleet comprised of two aircraft types that are significantly more fuel efficient than the dc s that were replaced 
we retired our last dc aircraft at the beginning of and accepted delivery of fourteen new b and b aircraft during the remainder of the year 
our fixed price fuel contracts and fuel cap contracts reduced our fuel expense by million and million during and  respectively 
maintenance  materials and repairs decreased percent on an asm basis 
on a block hour basis  maintenance costs decreased percent to approximately per block hour 
as the original manufacturer warranties expire on our b aircraft the maintenance  repair and overhaul of major aircraft engine  parts and components become covered by previously negotiated agreements with faa approved maintenance contractors 
contractually we pay monthly fees based on the level of our operations  generally measured by either the number of flight hours flown or the number of landings 
our increased level of operations during the year and the related costs associated with our maintenance agreements predominantly account for the overall increase in this area 
distribution costs decreased percent on an asm basis primarily due to the overall decrease of passenger revenues derived from travel agency sales 
although total distribution costs have increased  these costs as a percentage of passenger revenues have decreased as more of our passengers have shifted their bookings directly onto our website 
we recognize significant cost savings when our sales are booked directly through our website as opposed to more traditional methods  such as travel agents 
depreciation decreased percent on an asm basis 
overall depreciation expense increased due to the purchase of two new b aircraft 
however  with the exception of two bs  all aircraft additions during the year were lease financed rather than purchased 
non operating expenses other income expense  net increased by million primarily due to the receipt in of a government reimbursement pursuant to the wartime act of million  partially offset by a million charge related to the write off of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs due to the early retirement of debt and of conversion of debt to equity and by a million reduction in in interest expense as a result of having reduced our outstanding debt obligations 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of funds is cash provided by operations and cash provided by financing activities 
our primary uses of cash are for working capital including labor and fuel costs  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  which may include the acquisition of other airlines and their assets  whether in connection with bankruptcy proceedings relating to such carriers of their assets or otherwise in other investments in strategic alliances  code sharing agreements or other business arrangements

index to financial statements our total cash  including cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments totaled million and million at december   and  respectively 
short term investments represent auction rate securities with reset periods less than months 
operating activities for the twelve months ended december  generated million of cash compared to million for the comparable period in the increase was  primarily  due to an increase in passenger bookings for future travel  a decrease in prepaid fuel inventories and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due primarily to deferred credits that we received during and an increase in our outstanding payables due to increased operations 
this was offset by lower net income  an increase in other assets  primarily prepaid aircraft rent and maintenance reserves  and an increase in restricted cash during for our outstanding letters of credits 
investing activities for the twelve months ended december  used million in cash compared to million in our investing activities primarily consist of capital expenditures related to aircraft  aircraft purchase deposits required for scheduled deliveries in future periods and purchases and sales of auction rate securities that for cash investments 
additionally  cash is used for the purchase of spare parts and equipment related to the b and b aircraft fleets 
financing activities for the twelve months ended december  generated million of cash compared to million for the comparable period in during  we generated cash from the issuance of debt financing for aircraft pre delivery deposits of million  offset by debt repayments of million

index to financial statements off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 
we have no arrangements of the types described in the first three categories that we believe may have a material current or future affect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
certain guarantees that we do not expect to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  liquidity or resulted operations are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
effective october   we adopted fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires the consolidation of certain types of entities in which a company absorbs a majority of another entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the other entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the other entity 
these entities are called variable interest entities or vies 
the principal characteristics of vies are an insufficient amount of equity to absorb the entity s expected losses  equity owners as a group are not able to make decisions about the entity s activities  or equity that does not absorb the entity s losses or receive the entity s residual returns 
variable interests are contractual  ownership or other monetary interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the entity s net asset value 
as a result  vies can arise from items such as lease agreements  loan arrangements  guarantees or service contracts 
if an entity is determined to be a vie  the entity must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the holder of the variable interests that absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or receive a majority of the entity s residual returns in the event no holder has a majority of the expected losses 
there is no primary beneficiary in cases where no single holder absorbs the majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the residual returns 
the determination of the primary beneficiary is based on projected cash flows at the inception of the variable interest 
we have variable interests in our aircraft leases 
the lessors are trusts established specifically to purchase  finance and lease aircraft to us 
these leasing entities meet the criteria of vies 
we are generally not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee  a fixed price purchase option or similar feature that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft 
this is the case in the majority of our aircraft leases  however we have two aircraft leases that contain fixed price purchase options that allow us to purchase the aircraft at predetermined prices on specified dates during the lease term 
we have not consolidated the related trusts because even taking into consideration these purchase options  we are not the primary beneficiary based on our cash flow analysis 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the following is a description of what we believe to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided 
ticket sales for transportation which has not yet been provided are recorded as air traffic liability 
air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates 
the balance of the air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity 
nonrefundable tickets expire one year from the date the ticket is purchased 
a percentage of tickets expire unused 
we estimate the amount of unused tickets based on historical experience 
passenger traffic commissions and related fees are expensed when the related revenue is recognized 
passenger traffic commissions and related fees not yet recognized are included as a prepaid expense 
stock based compensation 
the adoption of sfas no 
r  share based payment  in will require the recording of stock based compensation expense for issuances under our equity incentive plans over their requisite service period using a fair value approach similar to the current pro forma disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r does not mandate an option pricing model to be used in determining fair value  but does require that the model selected consider certain variables 
different models would result in different valuations 
regardless of the method selected  significant judgment is required for some of the valuation variables 
the most significant of these is the volatility of our common stock and the estimated term over which our stock options will be outstanding 
the valuation calculation is sensitive to even slight changes in these estimates 
although there will be no impact to our overall cash flows  the adoption of sfas no 
r will have a impact on our results of operations 
most of the stock based compensation expense to be recorded in will relate to restricted stock awards and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan and not to stock options  as we accelerated the vesting of million outstanding stock options in september we will use the modified prospective method to account for stock based compensation 
we expect that the adoption of sfas r will reduce earnings by less than million 
frequent flyer program 
we accrue a liability for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel for awards earned under our a rewards program based on awards we expect to be redeemed 
we adjust this liability based on points earned and redeemed as well as for changes in the estimated incremental costs 
points under our a rewards program may also be earned using our branded credit card 
a pro rated portion of revenue earned from this credit card is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is likely to be provided  based on estimates of fair value of tickets to be redeemed 
amounts received in excess of the tickets fair values are recognized in income currently 
accounting for long lived assets 
when appropriate  we evaluate our long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the net book 
table of contents 
index to financial statements value of those assets 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimated fair market value of the assets  and ii estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values 
we have approximately million of long lived assets as of december  on a cost basis  including approximately million of flight equipment and related equipment on a cost basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions we are subject to certain market risks  including interest rates and commodity prices ie  aircraft fuel 
the adverse effects of changes in these markets pose a potential loss as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our financial accounting policies and additional information 
interest rates as of december  and  the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be million and million  respectively  based upon discounted future cash flows using current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments or market prices 
market risk  estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates  was approximately million as of december   and approximately million as of december  our long term debt obligations that bear fixed rates of interest may be prepaid without penalty prior to their respective maturity dates and  therefore  a change in market interest rates generally would not affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if interest rates average higher in than in  for our variable rate debt  our interest expense would increase by approximately million 
aviation fuel our results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
aircraft fuel expense for the years ended and represented approximately percent and percent of our operating expenses  respectively 
increases in fuel prices or a shortage of supply could have a material effect on our operations and operating results 
based in our projected fuel consumption  a percent increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel for the year ended december   would increase fuel expense for the next twelve months by approximately million including the effects of our fuel purchase contracts 
comparatively  based on fuel usage  a percent increase in fuel prices would have resulted in an increase in fuel expense of approximately million  including the effects of our contracts 
as of december   utilizing fixed price arrangements and cap arrangements  we agreed to purchase approximately percent and percent of our anticipated fuel needs at a weighted average price of and  respectively  per gallon of aviation fuel for and  including delivery to our operations hub in atlanta and other locations
