item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition as of december  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
also  additional information on our revenues and operations can found above in business general overview and operating strategy 
our revenue items produce different operating margins 
broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  luxury suite and track rentals  and on site advertising produce higher margins than souvenir and other merchandise sales  as well as sales of tsi  legends cars  oil chem  smi trackside  mbm  bulk petroleum transactions or other operating revenues 
significant growth in our revenues will depend  in part  on consistent investment in facilities 
as further described in capital expenditures below  we have several capital projects underway at each of our speedways 
we do not believe our financial performance has been materially affected by inflation 
we have generally been able to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices 
results of operations revenues and expenses our revenues and expenses are classified in the following categories because they are important to  and used by  us in assessing our operations 
we classify our revenues as admissions  event related revenue  nascar broadcasting revenue  and other operating revenue 
admissions includes ticket sales for all of our events 
event related revenue includes amounts received from sponsorship and naming rights fees  luxury suite rentals  souvenir sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  promotional and hospitality revenues  track rentals  driving school and karting revenues  broadcasting rights other than nascar broadcasting revenue  and other event and speedway related revenues 
nascar broadcasting revenue includes rights fees obtained for domestic television broadcasts of nascar sanctioned events held at our speedways 
other operating revenue includes tsi  mbm and certain smi properties merchandising revenues  bulk petroleum transactions  legends car and parts sales  speedway clubs restaurant  catering and membership income  oil chem revenues  and industrial park and office tower rentals 
our revenue items produce different operating margins 
our share of the profits or losses of the motorsports authentics merchandising joint venture is included in other income or expense  and will be reported separately if and when significant 
see business operations above for additional information on the composition of our revenues  including non product and product revenue sources 
we classify our expenses to include direct expense of events  nascar purse and sanction fees  and other direct operating expense  among other categories 
direct expense of events principally includes cost of souvenir sales  non nascar race purses and sanctioning fees  property and event insurance  compensation of certain employees  advertising  sales and admission taxes  cost of driving school and karting operations  event settlement payments to non nascar sanctioning bodies and outside event support services 
nascar purse and sanction fees includes payments to nascar for associated events held at our speedways 
other direct operating expense includes the cost of tsi  mbm and certain smi properties merchandising  gross bulk petroleum  legends car  speedway clubs  oil chem and industrial park rental revenues 
racing events we derive a substantial portion of our total revenues from admissions  event related and nascar broadcasting revenue

also  the chase for the cup the last ten races of season achieved strong ratings increases over the prior year 
management believes these rating increases bode well for smi and our industry in the future 
our results for the race season reflect ongoing increases in sponsorship  luxury suite rentals  advertising and other corporate event related revenues 
despite rising fuel prices and the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita  ticket sales increased over last year for most of our nascar nextel cup and busch series races 
almost million fans attended our events in  demonstrating that demand and appeal for motorsports entertainment in our markets has remained strong even in challenging circumstances 
all of our nascar nextel cup and busch speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents event sponsorships are already sold  and pre sales for other corporate event related revenues are showing similar trends 
however  at this early date  management is unable to determine whether event results will differ from those previously estimated 
the national incidents of september   along with the iraq war and terrorism alerts  have raised a combination of operating factors rarely encountered  including public concerns regarding air travel  military actions  and additional national or local catastrophic incidents 
natural disasters such as hurricanes katrina and rita can cause significant increases in fuel prices and significant adverse economic effects 
these factors affect consumer and corporate spending sentiment 
reduced consumer and corporate spending impacted the demand for souvenir  apparel and other merchandise at certain non event company and outside venues  with related effects on event related and other operating revenues 
economic conditions could be severely affected by future actual or threatened events of a similar nature or other national  regional or local incidents  which could materially adversely affect our future operating results 
while management believes our strong operating cash flow will continue  economic conditions  rising fuel prices  and the competitiveness of racing can affect ticket  corporate marketing  sponsorships and other sales 
management believes long term ticket demand  including corporate marketing and promotional spending  should continue to grow 
however  management decided not to increase many ticket and concession prices in to help foster fan support and mitigate any near term demand weakness 
nascar broadcasting rights agreement fiscal is our fifth year under the current multi year consolidated domestic television broadcast rights agreement for nascar nextel cup and busch series events 
our nascar broadcasting revenues were million  reflecting an increase of approximately million or over which includes the new nextel cup and busch series racing event at tms 
broadcasting revenues continue to be a significant long term revenue source for our core business  representing approximately of our total revenues 
total contracted revenues under this domestic broadcast rights agreement  based on the current race schedule  are approximately million in this reflects an increase of approximately million or over a substantial portion of our recent profit growth has resulted from a significant increase in our television revenues received from the arrangements nascar has made with various television networks 
nascar ratings may also impact attendance at our events and sponsorship opportunities 
the current six year nascar domestic television broadcast rights agreements with nbc sports  turner sports  fox and fx expire after nascar has recently announced that it has reached new combined eight year agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed channel for the domestic broadcast rights to all nascar nextel cup and busch series events for through nascar also announced that these agreements have a billion contract period value  representing approximately million in gross average annual rights fees for the industry and a average annual increase over the current contract annual average of million 
however  nascar announced that anticipated industry rights fees could range between approximately million and million  which are lower than the rights fees of approximately million 
no further details have been provided at this time 
although initially lower  this eight year arrangement provides us with a significant increase in average annual contracted revenues through we believe this new long term contracted revenue sources helps solidify our financial strength and stabilize our earnings and cash flows  and bodes well for smi and our industry in the future 
we also believe these new contracts have long term strategic benefits 
for instance  over the past several years major sports programming has begun to shift between network and cable 
cable broadcasters can support a higher investment through subscriber fees not available to networks  which is resulting in increased rights fees for these sports properties 
however  cable reaches fewer households than network broadcasts 
nascar s decision to retain approximately two thirds of its event schedule on network television is believed to be important to the sport s future growth  and should continue to drive increased fan and media awareness for all three nascar racing series  which should help increase long term attendance and corporate marketing appeal 
we believe espn s involvement should result in the busch series benefiting from the improved continuity of season long presence on espn  and motorsports in general should benefit from increased ancillary programming and nightly and weekly nascar branded programming and promotions  similar to that espn provides with the other major sports 
future changes in race schedules would impact these amounts 
similar to many televised sports  overall seasonal averages for motorsports may increase or decrease from year to year  while television ratings for certain individual events may fluctuate from year to year for any number of reasons 
while this long term rights agreement will likely result in annual revenue increases over the contract period  associated annual increases in purse and sanction fees paid to nascar may continue 
our share of the television broadcast revenues are contracted  and purse and sanction fees are negotiated  with nascar on an annual basis

table of contents new nascar nextel cup and busch series racing events at tms in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in july  we acquired certain tangible and intangible assets and operations of north carolina speedway for approximately million in cash as part of the ferko shareholder lawsuit settlement 
intangible assets acquired were principally race event sanctioning and renewal agreements with nascar for conducting one annual nextel cup and busch series racing event at tms  which were first held in november ams insurance recovery gain on july   a tornado struck ams causing significant damage to its facilities 
restoration progressed sufficiently to allow ams to conduct its nascar nextel cup series and other races as scheduled in october settlement of insurance claims was substantially completed in the fourth quarter  and a gain from insurance recoveries upon final resolution of insurance claims was recognized net of a loss on damaged property and equipment 
the gain of million  before income taxes of million  increased basic and diluted earnings per share by 
as part of restoration plans  significant improvements and modernization of ams s facilities continue 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we ceased depreciating damaged property and equipment in july and began depreciating new and restored assets when placed in service 
in future years  depreciation on new and restored assets will likely be higher because of replacing fully depreciated assets and increased depreciable carrying costs 
stock repurchase program in april  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing smi to repurchase up to million shares of outstanding common stock from time to time  depending on market conditions  share price  applicable limitations under the credit facility and senior subordinated notes see note to the consolidated financial statements  and other factors the board of directors or their designees  in their sole discretion  may consider relevant 
the purchases can be in the open market or private transactions 
the stock repurchase program is presently funded using our available cash and cash equivalents and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
in  we repurchased approximately  shares of common stock for million 
accounting for share based compensation as further described below in recently issued accounting standards  sfas no 
r shared based payment was issued in december which requires  among other things  recognizing compensation cost for the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation over the requisite service period 
sfas no 
r applies to all awards granted  modified  vesting  repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date  which for us begins january  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective october   our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of all then outstanding  unvested stock options granted under our stock option plan and stock incentive plan 
this accelerated vesting is expected to reduce non cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following application of sfas no 
r 
we have elected the modified prospective method of transitioning to sfas no 
r  and in will begin recognizing compensation expense related to future stock option and other share based compensation grants  including immediate recognition for grantees who are retirement eligible rather than ratably over the vesting period regardless of retirement eligibility 
we have applied the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb no 
whereby the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share is presented based on compensation cost for stock options and the employee stock purchase plan determined using the fair value recognition provisions of fasb no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
bank credit facility amendments in march  we amended our credit facility which  among other things  modified the following terms and conditions i the revolving credit facility overall borrowing limit of million  the five year term loan  and separate sub limit of million for day swing line loans were retained  with an increase in the separate sub limit for standby letters of credit from million to million  ii extended maturity from may to march  iii increased allowable annual aggregate payments of dividends and repurchases of smi securities from million to million  and increasing up to million subject to maintaining certain revised financial covenants  iv expanded permitted investments of available cash  v reduced interest is now based  at our option  upon libor plus to or the greater of bank of america s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  and vi reduced unused commitment fees from to 
in december  we amended the credit facility modifying the following terms and conditions i annual capital expenditures are limited to million  plus up to an additional million for certain specified capital expenditures during the two year period of fiscal and  ii we may consummate motorsports industry related transactions provided that aggregate cash consideration in any fiscal year does not exceed of our consolidated net worth at the immediately preceding fiscal year end  and speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents iii we may consummate other acquisitions consistent with our business provided that cash consideration paid for such other acquisitions does not exceed an aggregate of million over the credit facility term 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
income taxes as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have significant net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities  the majority of which pertain to accelerated depreciation on our property and equipment for tax reporting purposes 
in evaluating the potential effects of the tax advice memorandum  we filed in a change in tax accounting method with the irs with respect to  among other things  changing tax depreciation methods and extending depreciable lives for certain significant motorsports facility assets 
the tax method accounting change is expected to reduce our tax depreciation expense for certain previous years and is being included in federal and state taxable income over four years beginning in as of december   the change resulted in reclassifying noncurrent deferred income taxes of approximately million to current accrued income taxes and accelerating the payment of additional noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities of approximately million in through accelerated taxes of approximately million were paid in  after using alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
we believe our use of a seven year recovery period prior to was appropriate in view of then existing tax law and related guidance 
we believe the filing of the change in tax accounting method is the best course of action to minimize costs and uncertainty 
we anticipate that cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these payments 
we believe we have sufficiently provided for income taxes and associated reserves  and no current or future charge to earnings is expected at this time resulting from the tax accounting change 
these amounts should be substantially recovered in succeeding years from increased tax depreciation as these assets continue to be depreciated for tax purposes over long periods 
as such  management does not believe the tax accounting change will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
joint venture equity investments as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  in august  the company and isc formed smisc  llc  an equally owned joint venture  operating as an independent company named motorsports authentics  to produce  market and sell motorsports licensed merchandise 
in september  motorsports authentics acquired certain tangible and intangible assets and operations of team caliber  inc from roush corporation d b a roush racing  and entered into a long term license with roush racing for exclusive and non exclusive motorsports merchandise distribution for various racing drivers and teams in nascar nextel cup  busch and craftsman truck series 
team caliber markets and distributes licensed motorsports merchandise  including die cast replicas of motorsports vehicles  apparel  gifts and memorabilia through collectible  mass retail and trackside distribution channels 
in december  the joint venture purchased action performance companies  inc for per common share or approximately million in cash plus transaction costs 
action is the leader in design  promotion  marketing and distribution of licensed merchandise with products including a broad range of motorsports related die cast replica collectibles  apparel  gifts and other memorabilia  and has license agreements with many of the top nascar teams and drivers 
in addition  action designs and sells products relating to other motorsports including the nhra  formula one and irl and also has licenses to manufacture apparel and memorabilia for the national basketball association  major league baseball  and multiple other branded organizations 
action currently markets its products primarily through a combination of mass retail  domestic wholesale  trackside  international and collector s clubs 
we funded our share of the purchase price with available cash and cash equivalents 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we use the equity method of accounting for our ownership in ma  whose operations are presently comprised of action and team caliber 
our share of operating results of ma including the operations of action after acquisition in december for its fiscal year ending november  will be included in our fiscal consolidated statement of income 
our investment in ma is sizable and our share of future associated profits or losses may or may not be significant 
resulting profits or losses could be affected by or depend on future demand  trends  and other market conditions and factors such as the success of motorsports  the popularity of its licensed drivers and teams  particularly nascar s nextel cup series  competition for action and team caliber products  and the success of action and team caliber management in achieving sustained profitably and successful integration 
their ability to compete successfully and profitably depends on a number of factors both within and outside management s control 
there may be increases in our investment in these associated entities  including additional equity contributions or loans to ma 
the carrying value of these equity investments could become impaired for changes in profitability  operating cash flows  market  economic conditions  and other factors that could adversely impact their recovery

bulk petroleum transactions for several years  we maintained a presence in the petroleum and automotive aftermarket industries by way of motorsports and non motorsports activities and associations with automobile manufacturers and dealerships and petroleum product suppliers for the manufacture of oil chem products 
we have historically purchased significant amounts of petroleum products for use at our speedways and in the manufacture of oil chem products  particularly since when oil chem was acquired 
in an effort to reduce our costs for these products  we began to explore the purchase of petroleum products in larger quantities through our contractual relationships with parties having significant experience in all phases of the petroleum industry 
we believe we can use short term excess cash in the purchase and sale of these products resulting in enhanced earnings growth for smi and our oil chem subsidiary 
to effect this goal  we attempted to enter into short term purchase and supply contracts lasting approximately one year or less for the purchase and sale of crude oil and associated distillates of crude oil bulk petroleum products 
while attempting to employ this strategy over the past few years  the world markets for petroleum products became increasingly complex and competitive  lengthening the period of time needed to secure short term agreements 
we have pursued and continue to pursue such agreements with petroleum producers throughout the world 
during this process  we have occasionally purchased bulk quantities of petroleum products on the open market  chartered vessels when necessary and sold and delivered products to customers 
we insure such activities with maritime insurance experts and may enter into commodity hedges with major financial institutions to reduce price risk while bulk products are owned 
sales and purchases of bulk petroleum products are with petroleum and other companies who conduct business in the united states as well as foreign countries 
commodity hedges associated with petroleum products and letters of credit utilized  are issued by recognized domestic and foreign financial institutions 
purchases  sales  commodity hedges and letters of credit hereafter are collectively associated with or refer to bulk petroleum transactions 
these products have been principally purchased from suppliers  and sold to customers  in central america who are involved in the local  regional and national petroleum industry 
we also have profit and loss sharing arrangements with certain entities on the purchasing and selling of specified bulk petroleum products 
these entities generally share to of the profits and losses on the sale of specified products 
these bulk petroleum activities have comprised a relatively minor part of our business 
our core business has been and remains motorsports 
management recognizes that this bulk petroleum business has financial and operational risks different from those of our core operations 
however  many are risks ordinarily experienced by any new business  risks ordinarily associated with conducting business in foreign countries  as well as risks generally associated with petroleum products  commodities  hedging and similar transactions of this nature 
we evaluate the underlying transactional terms and conditions  along with associated accounting guidance  in determining whether revenues  costs  and operating profits or losses  including changes in the fair value of commodity hedges and shared profits and losses  from bulk petroleum transactions should be reported on a gross or net basis 
gross revenues and product and associated operating costs from bulk petroleum transactions are included in other operating revenue and other direct operating expense  respectively 
we have a contract to supply petroleum products that is considered an energy supply contract  which expires june   and is treated as a derivative under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we estimated the fair value of this derivative contract based on a pricing model using nymex and gulf market prices  and determined that its fair value was not significant as of december  or operating profits or losses associated with such contract are reported on a net basis in other operating revenue 
for bulk petroleum transactions reported on a gross basis during  revenues totaled million 
there were no bulk petroleum transactions reported on a gross basis in or for bulk commodity transactions reported on a net basis for and  associated billings totaled million and million  and associated realized profits or losses on the derivative energy trading contract were not significant 
there were no significant bulk commodity transactions reported on a net basis in as of december   we are party to certain commodity fair value hedges associated with bulk petroleum inventory 
these hedges have a fair market value of  as of december  and are included in current liabilities 
we have not used mark to market accounting for energy contracts that are not derivatives under sfas no 
or carried associated product inventories at fair market value  and dealer profit or unrealized gains or losses at inception of energy trading contracts have not been recognized 
we report the changes in fair value  and settlement gains or losses  of hedge contracts in other operating revenue 
net gains or losses on such hedges in or were not significant 
our amended credit facility increased the separate sub limit for standby letters of speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents credit to million in anticipation of possible increases in our bulk petroleum business and other business transactions 
as of december   we had outstanding standby letters of credit of approximately million associated with bulk petroleum transactions 
bulk petroleum transactions may involve concentrations of credit risk different from our motorsports operations 
at december   we had credit risk concentration in receivables and inventories and certain inventory hedges associated with bulk petroleum sales and purchase transactions 
approximately million or of our total accounts receivable are due from a relatively small number of petroleum industry customers in central america 
also  at december   bulk petroleum inventory products aggregating million are located and managed by one vendor in central america 
we are pursuing sales arrangements whose ultimate selling prices are not finalized and associated inventory costs are expected to be substantially recovered upon resale in realization of receivables and inventories are subject to many factors outside management s control 
factors that can adversely impact realization include changes or deterioration in customer financial condition and creditworthiness  current and future market demand  regional and global market and economic conditions  including geopolitical situations in and surrounding specific countries or regions  government actions that restrict transactions  access to or transfers of assets or funds  global petroleum product supply and demand  regional or worldwide natural disasters such as hurricanes that adversely impact supply channels  merchandising  distribution and operating costs  and other factors 
default on payment by one or more customers  or should inventory not be realized or recovered  could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
bulk petroleum transactions may continue to occur in the near future  and they may or may not be significant 
while revenues could become significant  resulting profit margins could be affected by market and other factors such as transaction  unrecoverable and other operating costs  and could be less than those on existing operations 
the accounting for bulk petroleum  including underlying hedge  transactions can be affected by many factors  including contract terms  title transfer  settlement timing  underlying hedge terms and other transactional terms or conditions 
future transactions and resulting gains or losses  if any  could be reported on either a gross or net basis 
mark to market accounting may be used for certain hedges and bulk petroleum purchases or supply contracts may constitute an energy contract that is deemed a derivative under sfas no 
 depending on the underlying transactional terms and conditions 
also  future gains or losses on such contracts could be significant depending on fluctuations in market prices of the associated covered petroleum products and timing differences between maturities of hedges and sales of petroleum products 
depending on settlement timing and other transactional factors  accounts receivable  inventories  liabilities  and outstanding letters of credit could significantly increase during and between reporting periods 
at this time  management is unable to determine whether resulting revenues or profits or losses could be material 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on bulk petroleum transactions 
non event souvenir and other merchandising revenues management intends to develop new merchandising opportunities  expand product offerings through electronic media promotional programming  and market racing and other sports related souvenir merchandise and apparel with corporate customers and other third party venues 
our other operating revenues may increase depending on  among other factors  the success of such efforts  the success of motorsports  particularly nascar s nextel cup series  and future market demand  trends and competition for our non event products and outside venues 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside management s control 
these revenue items may produce lower operating margins than broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals 
while our revenues may increase  there may be associated increases in receivables and inventory levels whose realization is subject to changes in market and economic conditions and other factors that might adversely impact realization 
earnings guidance in connection with our fourth quarter and full year earnings release  we provided full year guidance of per diluted share assuming current industry and economic trends continue  and excluding our share of motorsports authentics joint venture operating results  changes in our non core businesses  capital expenditures exceeding our current plans and other unforeseen factors

other income expense  net 
other income  net for was million compared to other expense  net of  for the change results primarily from current period recovery of a million pre tax charge to earnings previously recorded in for litigation associated with bms 
this recovery was recorded based on recent court reversal of the decision that awarded damages and dismissal of claims against the company upon successful appeal see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
this change is also due to a gain recognized on sale of land in  and to recognizing a loss on disposal of equipment damaged at tms in no such losses were recognized in the remainder of the change was due to a combination of individually insignificant items 
income tax provision 
our effective income tax rate for was and for was 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the tax rate reflects decreased effective state income tax rates speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents resulting primarily from reduction of previously recorded valuation allowances in against deferred tax assets  associated with state net operating loss carryforwards  because management determined ultimate realization is more likely than not 
the reduction was based principally on the anticipated future increase in taxable income resulting from the additional nascar nextel cup and busch series racing events at tms 
net income for increased by million  or  over such income for this increase is due to the factors discussed above 
seasonality and quarterly results our business has been  and is expected to remain  highly seasonal 
we produce minimal operating income during our third quarter when we host only one major nascar race weekend 
concentration of racing events in any particular future quarter  and the growth in our operations with attendant increases in overhead expenses  may tend to minimize operating income in respective future quarters 
racing schedules may change from time to time which can lessen the comparability of operating results between quarters of successive years and increase or decrease the seasonal nature of our motorsports business

capital expenditures management believes significant growth in our revenues depends  in part  on consistent investment in facilities 
as such  we expect to continue to make substantial capital improvements in our facilities to meet increasing demand and to increase revenue 
currently  a number of significant capital projects are underway 
projects at december   we had various construction projects underway to increase and improve facilities for fan amenities and for other site improvements at our speedways 
similar to prior years  we continue to expand concessions  camping  restrooms and other fan amenities at certain facilities 
in  lvms began construction of approximately  new permanent grandstand seats for a net increase of approximately  that was completed in march in  ams plans to begin construction of approximately  new premium front stretch and club style permanent seats 
we plan to renovate and modernize certain infield garages  media centers  scoring towers and other facilities  resurface or modify the banking of certain speedways  and purchase additional land for expansion or development 
we also plan to continue improving and expanding on site roads and available parking  reconfiguring traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow at our speedways 
in march  the company announced construction plans for a unit condominium speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents project at lvms  which would include trackside office space  banquet facilities  spa and health club and other amenities 
commencement of construction is subject to governmental approval and permitting processes  which could materially affect the ultimate cost and timing of construction 
see item properties above for additional information 
projects in  bms completed construction of new luxury speedway suites and new permanent dragway seats 
similar to prior years  we continued to expand concessions  camping  restrooms and other fan amenities for the convenience  comfort and enjoyment of fans at several of our speedways 
we also continued to improve and expand on site roads and available parking  reconfigured traffic patterns and entrances to ease congestion and improve traffic flow  and enhanced safer crash walls at several of our speedways and purchased certain land for expansion or development  and remodeled the dining and entertainment facilities at the speedway club at lms 
ams speedway facilities were restored  improved and modernized after the tornado that struck in july the estimated aggregate cost of capital expenditures in is approximately to million 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at our facilities  including undetected soil or land conditions  additional land acquisition costs  increases in the cost of construction materials and labor  unforeseen changes in design  litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site  and national or regional economic changes 
in addition  the actual cost could vary materially from our estimates if our assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
construction is also subject to state and local permitting processes  which if changed  could materially affect the ultimate cost and timing of construction 
we also continually evaluate new opportunities that will add value for our stockholders  including the acquisition and construction of new speedway facilities  the expansion and development of our existing bulk petroleum business  legends cars and oil chem products and markets  and the expansion into new and complementary businesses 
dividends any decision concerning the payment of common stock dividends depends upon our results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans  applicable limitations under the credit facility and senior subordinated notes  and other factors the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
as further described above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  our credit facility allows annual aggregate payments of dividends and repurchases of smi securities of up to million  and increasable up to million  subject to maintaining certain financial covenants 
the senior subordinated notes indenture permits annual dividend payments of up to approximately per share of common stock  increasable subject to meeting certain financial covenants 
on october   the company s board of directors approved an annual cash dividend of per share of common stock aggregating approximately million payable on november  to shareholders of record as of november  the annual cash dividend was paid using available cash and cash investments 
off balance sheet arrangements as further described in liquidity and capital resources above  we had aggregate outstanding letters of credit of million associated principally with bulk petroleum transactions and contingent guarantee obligations of million as of december  as further described in significant recent developments above  our amended credit facility increased the separate sub limit for standby letters of credit to million in anticipation of possible increases in our bulk petroleum business and other business transactions 
we presently do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements including off balance sheet obligations  guarantees  commitments  or other contractual cash obligations  other commercial commitments or contingent obligations that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  including amounts that are susceptible to change 
we continually review our accounting policies and accounting estimates  and their application and effect on our financial statements and disclosures  for conformity with gaap  including relevance  speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents accuracy  completeness and non omission of material information 
our critical accounting policies include accounting methods and estimates underlying such financial statement preparation  as well as judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies 
in applying critical accounting policies and making estimates  materially different amounts or results could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the consolidated financial statements  including the associated notes  appearing elsewhere in this report 
we believe our critical accounting policies  including amounts involving significant estimates  uncertainties and susceptibility to change include the following recoverability of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets and equity investments in associated entities as of december   we have net property and equipment of million  net goodwill and other intangible assets of million and equity investments in associated entities of million 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we periodically evaluate long lived assets for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows and profitability attributable to such assets or when indications of possible impairment occur 
the evaluation is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
while we believe no impairment exists at december   different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and our financial condition or future results of operations 
nascar has announced it would consider potential track realignment of nextel cup series racing events to desirable  potentially more profitable market venues of speedway operators 
while relocation of any nextel cup event among our speedways we now or may own in the future could result in a net increase in our future operating profitability  long lived assets of a speedway from where a nextel cup racing event may move could become impaired resulting in a material impairment charge that adversely affects our financial condition or future results of operations 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  equity investments in associated entities consist primarily of our owned joint venture motorsports authentics  whose operations are presently comprised of action and team caliber 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we use the equity method of accounting for this joint venture 
ma has a november fiscal year end that we adopted for reporting our share of ma s operating results so that reporting periods coincide 
we record our share of ma s net income or loss based on their most recent quarterly financial statements 
our share of operating results of motorsports authentics including the operations of action since its acquisition in december for its fiscal year ending november  will be included in our fiscal consolidated statement of income 
our investment in ma is sizable and our share of future associated profits or losses may or may not be significant 
resulting profits or losses could be affected by or depend on future demand  trends  and other market conditions and factors such as the success of motorsports  the popularity of its licensed drivers and teams  particularly nascar s nextel cup series  competition for action and team caliber products  and the success of action and team caliber management in achieving sustained profitably and successful integration 
their ability to compete successfully and profitably depends on a number of factors both within and outside management s control 
there may be increases in our investment in these associated entities  including additional equity contributions or loans to ma 
the carrying value of these equity investments could become impaired for changes in profitability  operating cash flows  market  economic conditions  and other factors that could adversely impact their recovery 
depreciable and amortizable lives for property and equipment and intangible assets depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
we have net property and equipment of million and net amortizable intangible assets of million as of december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our property and equipment  other intangible assets and estimated useful lives 
as of december   we have nonamortizable intangible assets of million and goodwill of million for race event sanctioning and renewal agreements that are considered to have indefinite useful lives because their renewal and cash flow generation is expected to continue indefinitely 
useful lives are estimated based on outside cost segregation and valuation studies conducted on purchased or constructed speedway property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  historical experience  intended use  condition  available information for comparable assets  and other factors and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives we use to record depreciation and amortization expense  and believe such estimated useful lives are appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
we also periodically review whether non amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents remains appropriate  and believe such non amortization is appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
however  because we have a material investment in depreciable property and equipment and intangible assets  changes in depreciable and amortizable lives  should they occur  could have a significant impact on our financial condition or future results of operations 
revenue recognition for our racing events we recognize admissions  nascar broadcasting and other event related revenues when an event is held 
advance revenues and certain related direct expenses pertaining to specific events are deferred until the event is held 
deferred expenses primarily include race purses and sanctioning fees remitted to nascar or other sanctioning bodies and sales and admission taxes and credit card processing fees on advance revenues 
deferred race event income relates to scheduled events to be held in upcoming periods 
if circumstances prevent a race from being held during the racing season i generally advance revenue is refundable and ii all deferred direct event expenses would be immediately recognized except for race purses and sanction fees which would be refundable from nascar or other sanctioning bodies  and for sales and admission taxes which would be refundable from taxing authorities 
we believe this accounting policy results in appropriate recognition and matching of revenues and expenses associated with our racing events and helps ensure comparability and consistency between our financial statements 
we believe our revenue recognition polices follow the guidance issued in sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue recognition for bulk petroleum transactions as further discussed in significant recent developments bulk petroleum transactions above  from time to time  we are engaged in the purchase and sale of bulk petroleum and related products and commodity transactions 
we also enter into commodity hedges associated with petroleum products and utilize letters of credit for the purchase and sale of bulk petroleum products 
gross revenues and product and associated operating costs from bulk petroleum transactions are included in other operating revenue and other direct operating expense  respectively 
we have profit and loss sharing arrangements with certain entities on the purchasing and selling of specified bulk petroleum products  under which we generally share to of the profits and losses on the sale of specified products 
we evaluate the underlying transactional terms and conditions  along with associated accounting guidance  in determining whether revenues  costs  and operating profits or losses  including changes in the fair value of commodity hedges and shared profits and losses  from bulk petroleum transactions should be reported on a gross or net basis 
we have a contract to supply petroleum products that is considered an energy supply contract and is treated as a derivative under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we estimate the fair value of this derivative contract based on a pricing model using nymex and gulf market prices 
we report the changes in fair value  and settlement gains or losses  of hedge contracts in other operating revenue 
operating profits or losses associated with such contract are reported on a net basis in other operating revenue 
the accounting for bulk petroleum  including underlying hedge  transactions can be affected by many factors  including contract terms  title transfer  settlement timing  underlying hedge terms and other transactional terms or conditions 
depending on transactional terms and conditions  future transactions and resulting gains or losses  if any  could be reported on either a gross or net basis 
mark to market accounting may be used for certain hedges and bulk petroleum purchases or supply contracts if deemed to be derivatives under sfas no 
depending on settlement timing and other transactional factors  accounts receivable  inventories  liabilities  and outstanding letters of credit could significantly increase during and between reporting periods 
see significant recent developments bulk petroleum transactions above  realization of receivables and inventories below  and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on bulk petroleum transactions 
realization of receivables and inventories we assess realization of accounts and notes receivable and inventories  including any need for allowances for doubtful accounts or inventories 
we consider such factors  among other things  as customer creditworthiness  historical collection and sales experience for receivables  and current inventory levels  current and future market demand  and trends and conditions for inventories 
the assessment is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  which are subject to changes in market and economic conditions  including changes or deterioration in customer financial condition or merchandising distribution and other factors  that might adversely impact realization 
if revenues increase  there may be associated increases in receivables and inventory levels whose realization is subject to these same conditions and factors 
as further described significant recent developments bulk petroleum transactions and risk factors our bulk petroleum business incurs financial and operational risks different from those of our other operations above  bulk petroleum transactions may involve factors and considerations with respect to the realization of receivables and inventories that are different from our motorsports operations 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities assuming they will be realized and settled at amounts reported in the financial statements 
our accounting for income taxes reflects our assessment of future tax liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing  likelihood of realization  and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation 
at december   net deferred tax liabilities totaled million  after reduction for net deferred tax assets of million 
these net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
a valuation allowance of million is provided against deferred tax assets as of december  management has assessed the deferred tax assets  after reduction for the valuation allowance  and believes realization is more likely than not 
however  changes in tax laws  assumptions or estimates used in the accounting for income taxes  or changes or adjustments resulting from review by taxing authorities  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement 
such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future results of operations 
as further discussed in significant recent developments income taxes above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have significant net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities  the majority of which pertain to accelerated depreciation on our property and equipment for tax reporting purposes 
in evaluating the potential effects of a july irs published tax advice memorandum  we filed in a change in tax accounting method with the irs with respect to  among other things  changing tax depreciation methods and extending depreciable lives for certain significant motorsports facility assets 
the tax method accounting change is expected to reduce our tax depreciation expense for certain previous years and is being included in federal and state taxable income over four years beginning in as of december   the change resulted in reclassifying noncurrent deferred income taxes of approximately million to current accrued income taxes and accelerating the payment of additional noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities of approximately million in through accelerated taxes of approximately million were paid in  after using alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
we believe our use of a seven year recovery period prior to was appropriate in view of then existing tax law and related guidance 
we believe the filing of the change in tax accounting method is the best course of action to minimize costs and uncertainty 
we anticipate that cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these payments 
we believe we have sufficiently provided for income taxes and associated reserves  and no current or future charge to earnings is expected at this time resulting from the tax accounting change 
these amounts should be substantially recovered in succeeding years from increased tax depreciation as these assets continue to be depreciated for tax purposes over long periods 
as such  management does not believe the tax accounting change will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
accounting for stock based compensation as of december   we continued to account for stock based employee compensation using accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees which recognizes compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of equity instruments awarded as permitted under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
as all stock options granted under our stock option plans have exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock at grant date  no compensation cost has been reflected in net income for these plans 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we currently disclose the pro forma effect on net income and earnings per share based on compensation cost for stock options and the employee stock purchase plan determined using fair value 
as further described below in recently issued accounting standards  sfas no 
r shared based payment was issued in december and requires  among other things  recognizing compensation cost for the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation over the requisite service period 
sfas no 
r applies to all awards granted  modified  vesting  repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date  and is effective for us beginning january  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  effective october   our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of all then outstanding  unvested stock options granted under our stock option plan and stock inventive plan 
this accelerated vesting is expected to reduce non cash compensation expense that would have been recorded in future periods following application of sfas no 
r 
we have elected the modified prospective method of transitioning to sfas no 
r  and in will begin recognizing compensation expense related to future stock option and other share based compensation grants  including immediate recognition for grantees who are retirement eligible rather than ratably over the vesting period regardless of retirement eligibility 
the effect of adopting sfas no 
r  speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k 
table of contents depending on numerous factors including  among others  market conditions and prices for our common stock  the number and vesting periods of options granted  exercised or cancelled  or the sensitivity and fluctuation in assumptions used in valuation methods  could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
legal proceedings and contingencies as discussed above in legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal matters and intend to continue to defend ourselves in existing legal actions in fiscal we use a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with our speedways  other properties and motorsports events  and other business risks 
we accrue a liability for contingencies if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
the likelihood of an adverse outcome and estimation of amounts are assessed using legal counsel on litigation matters  outside insurance administrators and consultants for insured and self insured claims  along with historical trends  assumptions and other information available at the time of assessment 
we believe amounts requiring accrual are properly reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
we do not believe the outcome of the lawsuits  incidents or other legal or business risk matters  will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations 
however  new or changes in pending or threatened legal action or claims against us  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of these matters and our financial condition or future results of operations

in june  we terminated the fair value hedge swap agreement that was settled with a  net payment to us 
the cash flow hedge swap agreement has notional amounts  interest payments and maturity dates that match the underlying debt 
the swap has a principal notional amount of million  provides for quarterly settlement and expires corresponding with the underlying hedged debt term 
at december  and  we have reflected net derivative assets for these hedges combined of approximately million and  and  and  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
fair value estimates are based on relevant market information at a specific point in time  and changes in assumptions or market conditions could significantly affect estimates
