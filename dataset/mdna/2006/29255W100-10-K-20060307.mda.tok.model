our business strategies include maintaining an active drilling and workover program  maximizing existing reserves and programs through high pressure air injection  utilizing other improved recovery techniques to maximize existing reserves and production  expanding our reserves  production  and drilling inventory through a disciplined acquisition program  exploring for reserves  and operating in a cost effective  efficient  and safe manner 

table of contents our financial results and ability to generate cash depend upon many factors  particularly the price of oil and natural gas 
commodity prices continued to strengthen in  with the average nymex prices increasing significantly in the past three years 
the average oil price per barrel for the nymex futures market was   and for   and  respectively 
the average natural gas price per mmbtu for the nymex futures market was   and for   and  respectively 
commodity prices are influenced by many factors that are outside of our control 
we cannot predict future commodity benchmark or wellhead prices 
for this reason  we attempt to mitigate the effect of commodity price risk by hedging a portion of our future production 
the significant increase in oil and natural gas prices over the past three years has continued to bid up the price of reserves to historically high levels 
we closed two significant acquisitions during the purchase of crusader energy corporation in october added substantial proved reserves to our mid continent properties 
the november acquisition of producing properties from kerr mcgee corporation also added substantial proved reserves to the mid continent region and the permian basin in west texas 
due to the rising cost of acquisitions  we are continuing to make significant investments within our core areas to develop proved undeveloped reserves and increase production from proved developed reserves through various secondary and tertiary recovery techniques  including our high pressure air injection program in the cca 
we will  however  continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as they arise and to the extent we believe we can realize a good rate of return to our shareholders 
we continue to believe that a portfolio of long lived quality assets will position us for future success  and that reserve replacement is a key statistical measure of our success in growing our asset base 
during  we replaced of our production 
our development program replaced of production and acquisitions replaced of production 
see business and properties general oil and natural gas production and reserves on page for the calculation of our reserve replacement ratios 
also in  we continued to see positive results from our phase i high pressure air injection project at the pennel unit and the phase ii implementation was completed in pennel is the largest unit of the cca units 
in the little beaver unit at the southern end of the cca  we continue to see positive production response in line with expectations with a barrel per day increase over the forecast production decline prior to the initiation of the project 
our independent reserve engineers  miller and lents  ltd 
estimated that we added million  million and million barrels  respectively  of proved undeveloped oil reserves associated with our high pressure air injection program at the end of   and over the long term  we believe that high pressure air injection technology can be applied throughout the cedar creek anticline 
highlights our financial and operating results for the year ended december  include the following oil and natural gas reserves increased to mmboe 
during  we added mmboe  replacing of the mmboe produced in see business and properties general oil and natural gas production and reserves on page for the calculation of our reserve replacement ratio 
oil reserves accounted for of total proved reserves  and of proved reserves are developed 
the estimated pretax present value of our reserves increased by to billion using a discount rate and constant year end prices of for oil and for natural gas 
the standardized measure at december  is billion 
standardized measure differs from pv by million  because standardized measure includes the effect of asset retirement obligations and future income taxes 
during  we had oil and natural gas revenues of million 
this represents a increase over the million of oil and natural gas revenues reported in we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  in this represents an increase of million  or per diluted share  over net income reported in net income for was reduced due to a one time million loss on early redemption of debt related to 
table of contents redemption premiums and the expensing of unamortized debt issuance costs related to our senior subordinated notes 
our realized average oil price for  including the effects of hedging  increased per bbl to per bbl as compared to the average price of per bbl 
our realized average natural gas price for  including the effects of hedging  increased per mcf to per mcf as compared to the average price of per mcf 
production volumes for increased to  mboe  boe per day  compared with production volumes of  mboe  boe per day 
the rise in production volumes was attributable to the continued success of our drilling program  uplift from our hpai tertiary recovery project in the cca  and acquisitions completed in and oil represented and of our total production in and  respectively 
on july   we issued million of senior subordinated notes due we received net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance and used approximately million of the net proceeds to redeem all of the outstanding principal and related accrued interest of our senior subordinated notes 
the remaining proceeds were used to reduce our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
on november   we issued million of senior subordinated notes due we received net proceeds of approximately million and used substantially all of the proceeds to reduce our indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
we invested million in oil and natural gas activities during excluding development related asset retirement obligations 
we invested million in development  exploitation  hpai expansion  and exploration activities  which yielded gross net wells  and million in acquiring proved properties and undeveloped leases during excluding asset retirement obligations 
in october  we completed the acquisition of crusader energy corporation  a privately held  independent oil and natural gas company for a purchase price of approximately million 
in november  we acquired oil and natural gas properties from kerr mcgee corporation for approximately million 
in september  we acquired oil and natural gas properties in the williston basin for approximately million 
during  we improved our financial flexibility and liquidity by extending the maturity of our revolving credit facility to december  and increasing our borrowing base to million 
at december   we had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility  million in outstanding letters of credit  and available borrowing capacity of million 

table of contents results of operations comparison of to below is a comparison of our results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  revenues and production 
the following table illustrates the primary components of oil and natural gas revenue for the years ended december  and  as well as each year s respective oil and natural gas volumes dollars in thousands except per unit and per day amounts year ended december  increase decrease revenues oil wellhead oil hedges total oil revenues natural gas wellhead natural gas hedges total natural gas revenues combined wellhead combined hedges total combined revenues revenues unit oil wellhead oil hedges total oil revenues natural gas wellhead natural gas hedges total natural gas revenues combined wellhead combined hedges total combined revenues total production volumes oil bbls natural gas mcf combined boe daily production volumes oil bbls day natural gas mcf day combined boe day average nymex prices oil per bbl natural gas per mcf 
table of contents oil revenues increased million from million in to million in the increase is due primarily to higher realized average oil prices which contributed approximately million in additional revenues and an increase in oil production volumes of mbbl which contributed approximately million in additional revenues 
the million increase in revenues from higher realized average oil prices consists of an million increase resulting from higher average wellhead oil prices  offset by increased hedging payments of million  or per bbl 
our average wellhead oil price increased per bbl in over as a result of increases in the overall market price for oil as reflected in the increase in the average nymex price from in to in our oil wellhead revenue was reduced by million and million in and  respectively  for the net profits interests payments related to our cca properties 
natural gas revenues increased million from million in to million in the increase is due primarily to increased natural gas production volumes of  mmcf which contributed approximately million in additional revenues and higher realized average natural gas prices which contributed approximately million in additional revenues 
the million increase in revenues from higher realized average natural gas prices consists of a million increase resulting from higher average wellhead natural gas prices  offset by increased hedging payments of million  or per mcf 
our average wellhead natural gas price increased per mcf in over due to an increase in the overall market price of natural gas as reflected in the increase in the average nymex price from in to in the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production are largely based on current market prices  which are beyond our control 
for comparability and accountability  we take a constant approach to budgeting commodity prices 
we presently analyze our inventory of capital projects based on nymex prices of per bbl and per mcf 
we do not assume any escalation of commodity prices when preparing our capital budget 
if nymex prices trend downward below our base deck  we may reevaluate our capital projects 
if commodity prices are significantly lower than our forecasted prices of for oil and for natural gas  it could have a material effect on our projected results 
in this case  we would have to borrow additional money under our existing revolving credit facility  attempt to access the capital markets  or curtail the capital program 
if drilling is curtailed or ended  future cash flows could be materially negatively impacted 
the table below illustrates the relationship between oil and natural gas wellhead prices as a percentage of average nymex prices for the years ended december  and management uses the wellhead to nymex margin analysis to analyze trends in our oil and natural gas revenues 
year ended december  oil wellhead bbl average nymex bbl differential to nymex oil wellhead to nymex percentage natural gas wellhead mcf average nymex mcf differential to nymex natural gas wellhead to nymex percentage in the fourth quarter of  the oil wellhead to nymex price percentage decreased to as low as 
we expect this oil wellhead to nymex price percentage to decrease further in the first half of to approximately to 
we attribute this widening to market conditions in the rocky mountain area  which is expected to adversely affect the wellhead price we receive in the cca 
in recent years  
table of contents production increases from competing canadian and rocky mountain producers  in conjunction with limited takeaway capacity from the rocky mountain area  have gradually widened the differential between our wellhead price and the benchmark nymex price at cushing  oklahoma 
a particularly active turnaround season in the first quarter of on the part of the rocky mountain area refiners will lead to a further widening of the differential 
we cannot accurately predict crude oil differentials for subsequent quarters 
in the fourth quarter of  the natural gas wellhead to nymex price percentage decreased to as low as due to pipeline capacity constraints 
we expect that this natural gas wellhead to nymex price percentage will remain approximately constant in the first half of expenses 
the following table summarizes our expenses for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease expenses in thousands production lease operations production  ad valorem  and severance taxes total production expenses other depletion  depreciation  and amortization exploration general and administrative excluding non cash stock based compensation non cash stock based compensation derivative fair value loss loss on early redemption of debt other operating total operating interest current and deferred income tax provision total expenses

total production expenses increased million from million in to million in this increase resulted from an increase in total production volumes  as well as a increase in production expenses per boe 
the increase in total production expenses per boe compares to a increase in revenues per boe due to a higher production margin defined as revenues less production expenses in as compared to the production expense attributable to lease operations for increased as compared to by million due to an increase in production volumes and an increase in the average per boe rate 
the increase in production volumes are the result of our drilling program  the and acquisitions  and our secondary and tertiary recovery programs  including the waterflood enhancement program and the high pressure air injection program 
these increased volumes resulted in approximately million of additional lease operations expense 
the increase in our average expense per boe was attributable to increases in prices paid to oilfield service companies and suppliers due to a current higher price environment  increased operational activity to maximize production  and the operation of higher operating cost wells  which have become more attractive due to increases in oil and natural gas prices 
this increased average per boe rate resulted in approximately million of additional lease operations expense for price escalation for services 
for  we anticipate an increase in lease operations expense on both an aggregate and a per boe basis 
we anticipate the overall increase due to a full year of production at our properties acquired in  further implementation of the high pressure air injection program and a full year of production expenses related to the little beaver hpai project  and the adoption of sfas r 
see non cash stock based compensation expense below 
in the third quarter of  we began expensing hpai production costs attributable to little beaver phase i that previously were being capitalized during the pressurization phase 
the production expense attributable to production  ad valorem  and severance taxes production taxes for increased as compared to by million due to an increase in production volumes and an increase in the average wellhead price we received for oil and natural gas production 
the increase 
table of contents in production volumes over resulted in approximately million of additional production taxes 
the average wellhead price we received for oil and natural gas revenues increased per boe  resulting in additional production taxes of approximately million in as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenues excluding the effect of hedges  production taxes for decreased slightly from for to for the effect of hedges is excluded from oil and natural gas revenues in the calculation of these percentages because this method more closely reflects the method used to calculate actual production taxes paid to taxing authorities 
for  total production taxes will depend in a large part on prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
however  the production tax rate should remain relatively constant at approximately of wellhead revenues before hedging 
depletion  depreciation  and amortization dd a expense 
dd a expense increased million from million in to million in due to a higher per boe rate and increased production volumes 
the per boe rate increased from due to the development of proved undeveloped reserves from the acquisitions  which do not increase total proved reserves  and higher drilling costs per boe of reserves than our historical dd a rate in certain areas 
these factors resulted in additional dd a expense of million 
the increase in production volumes of  mboe over resulted in million of additional dd a expense 
we anticipate that total dd a expense in will increase due to increased production and our planned capital expenditures of million 
we expect the invested capital to add barrels through the drill bit in at a cost higher than our historical dd a rate 
assuming capital expenditures do not differ significantly from our budgeted amount  we expect our dd a rate for to be higher per boe 
the dd a rate could vary significantly based on actual capital expenditures  production rates  net profits interests  and any acquisitions that close in additionally  changes in the market price for oil and natural gas could affect the level of our reserves 
exploration expense 
exploration expense increased million in as compared to during  we expensed exploratory dry holes totaling million 
of the exploratory dry holes expensed  were drilled in the shallow gas area of montana  was drilled in the permian basin  and was drilled in the cca 
in  we expensed exploratory dry holes at a cost of million 
in  three of the exploratory dry holes were drilled in our montana shallow gas area and one was drilled in the barnett shale in our mid continent area 
the following table details our exploration related expenses in thousands year ended december  increase decrease exploration expenses dry hole geological and geophysical seismic delay rentals impairment of unproved acreage total for  we expect to continue to incur exploration expense as we continue our current exploration projects in the mid continent and montana shallow gas area 
this amount could vary considerably  however  based on the success of these projects 
additionally  the adoption of sfas r will increase exploration expense in for non cash stock compensation both in total and per boe 
see non cash stock based compensation expense below 
with the current commodity price environment  we believe exploration programs can provide a rate of return comparable or superior to property acquisitions in certain areas 
we seek to acquire undeveloped 
table of contents acreage and or enter into drilling arrangements to explore in areas that complement our portfolio of properties 
in keeping with our exploitation focus  the exploration projects are expected to set up multi well exploitation projects if successful 
general and administrative g a expense 
g a expense excluding non cash stock based compensation increased million from million in to million in the overall increase  as well as the increase in the per boe rate  is a result of increased staffing to manage our larger asset base  higher activity levels  and increased personnel costs due to intense competition for human resources within the industry 
we have forecast general and administrative expenses in to increase approximately to as compared to the increase from is expected to result from increased staffing to manage our larger asset base and continuing increases in the costs to hire and retain experienced industry personnel  as well as the effect of adoption of sfas r  which will increase general and administrative expense in both in total and per boe 
see non cash stock based compensation expense below 
non cash stock based compensation expense 
non cash stock based compensation expense for increased million from million in to million in this expense represents the amortization of deferred compensation recorded in equity related to restricted stock granted under our incentive stock plan 
amortization of deferred compensation increased from primarily due to amortization recorded during related to  shares of restricted stock granted in in addition  certain restricted stock grants contain performance vesting provisions which require us to recognize periodic expense based on our current stock price  rather than the stock price at the day of grant 
as a result  our higher stock price has also resulted in increased amortization expense 
during the years ended december    and  we issued   and  shares  respectively  of restricted stock to employees which depend only on continued employment for vesting 
the following table illustrates by year of grant the vesting of these shares which remain outstanding at december  year of vesting year of grant total total during the years ended december    and  we issued   and zero shares of restricted stock to employees that not only depend on the passage of time and continued employment  but also on certain performance measures for their vesting 
the following table illustrates by year of grant the vesting of these performance based shares which remain outstanding at december  year of vesting year of grant total total 
table of contents total deferred compensation of million was outstanding and included in deferred compensation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  estimated amortization of deferred compensation is shown in the table below in thousands as of december  estimated amortization year ended december  expense total the estimated non cash stock based compensation expense shown above is in part dependent on fluctuations in our stock price because  as noted above  certain awards are accounted for as variable awards as they are based on achievement of certain performance measures 
subsequent to december   we issued  shares of restricted stock to our employees as part of our annual incentive program 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  which requires that companies recognize in their financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
as a result  in we will recognize expense associated with stock options granted under our incentive stock plan  which previously was only presented in pro forma disclosures 
total non cash stock based compensation expense expected to be recorded in  consisting of expense associated with both restricted stock and stock options  is approximately million 
this amount will not be reported separately on the consolidated statement of operations but will be allocated to lease operations  exploration  and general and administrative expense 
derivative fair value loss 
during  we recorded a million derivative fair value loss as compared to a million loss recorded in this derivative fair value loss represents the ineffective portion of the mark to market loss on our derivative hedging instruments  settlements received on our fixed to floating interest rate swaps  gains losses related to commodity derivatives not designated as hedges  and changes in the mark to market value of our fixed to floating interest rate swap

the interest rate swap loss decreased from due to the expiration of our fixed to floating interest rate swap in june the ineffectiveness loss is offset by a million gain related to undesignated commodity contracts which increased due to changes in the fair value of certain natural gas basis swaps 

table of contents as we previously discussed  our oil wellhead differentials are expected to increase at least through the first half of for this reason  we expect derivative fair value loss to increase in from due to additional ineffectiveness on our designated cash flow hedges 
significant and sustained increases in our oil wellhead differential could preclude the application of hedge accounting to many of our derivative contracts  and should this occur  future mark to market gains or losses would be recognized as derivative fair value gain loss in the consolidated statements of operations immediately 
this could result in material fluctuations in net income and stockholders equity from period to period 
loss on early redemption of debt 
in  we recorded a one time million loss on early redemption of debt related to the redemption premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of our senior subordinated notes 
we redeemed the notes with proceeds received from the issuance of our million senior subordinated notes in july other operating expense 
other operating expense increased million from million in to million in this increase is mainly due to an increase in third party natural gas transportation costs attributable to higher production volumes for as compared to for  we anticipate other operating expense to increase over  which reflects the increased transportation costs associated with higher expected production volumes 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million in as compared to the increase is primarily due to additional debt used to finance acquisitions and our capital program 
we issued million of senior subordinated notes in november  million of senior subordinated notes in july  and million of senior subordinated notes in april we also redeemed million of senior subordinated notes in august the weighted average interest rate  net of hedges  for was as compared to for this lower weighted average interest rate is the result of the debt issuances which have rates lower than our historical average rate

table of contents income taxes 
income tax expense for increased million from this increase is due primarily to an increase of million in income before income taxes 
our effective tax rate increased slightly in to from in as of december   we had generated approximately million of section credits related to our hpai program 
if unused  million of the section credits will expire in  million in  and million in to the extent our drilling and development activities continue to be greater than our cash flows for operating activities  we expect to pay immaterial amounts of current income taxes in with the largest percentage of our tax expense being deferred

we periodically draw on our revolving credit facility to fund acquisitions and other capital commitments 
historically  we have converted large balances on our revolving credit facility to senior subordinated notes to extend the maturity date of the debt and fix the interest rate 
our total borrowings less repayments on our revolving credit facility  as described above  resulted in a net increase in the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility of million from million at december  to million at december  during  we received net cash of million from financing activities 
on april   we issued million of senior subordinated notes and received net proceeds of approximately million 
on june   we issued and sold million shares of our common stock to the public at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of the common stock offering  after underwriting discounts 
table of contents and commissions and other expenses  were approximately million 
we used the net proceeds of the debt issuance and common stock offering to fund the acquisition of cortez  repay indebtedness under our revolving credit facility  and for general corporate purposes 
total borrowings less repayments on our revolving credit facility in resulted in a net increase in the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility of million from million at december  to million at december  during proceeds from financing activities were million 
net proceeds of approximately million from our revolving credit facility were used to fund various acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  we issued a total of million shares of our common stock to the public at a price of per share 
the net proceeds of the offering of approximately million were used to repurchase million shares from former investors in our company at a total cost of million 
current capitalization 
at december   we had total assets of billion 
total capitalization as of december  was billion  of which was represented by stockholders equity and by long term debt 
at december   we had total assets of billion 
total capitalization as of december  was million  of which was represented by stockholders equity and by long term debt 
the percentages of our capitalization represented by stockholders equity and long term debt could vary in the future if debt is used to finance potential future acquisitions 
capital commitments our primary needs for cash are as follows development  exploitation  and exploration of our existing oil and natural gas properties acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and leasehold acreage costs other general property and equipment funding of necessary working capital payment of contractual obligations for  our board of directors has approved the following million capital budget for oil and natural gas related activities  excluding asset retirement obligations and potential acquisitions in thousands budgeted capital expenditures development  exploitation  and exploration hpai leasehold acreage acquisition and other total we currently analyze our inventory of capital projects based on per bbl of oil and per mcf of natural gas nymex prices 
we do not assume any escalation of commodity prices when preparing our capital budget 
if nymex prices trend downward below our base deck  we may reevaluate capital projects and may adjust the capital budgeted for development  exploitation  and exploration investments accordingly 

table of contents development  exploitation  and exploration of existing properties 
the following table summarizes our costs incurred excluding asset retirement obligations related to development  exploitation  and exploration activities during the year ended december  and in thousands year ended december  development and exploitation hpai exploration total development and exploitation 
our expenditures for development and exploitation investments primarily relate to drilling development and infill wells  workovers of existing wells  and field related facilities excluding development related asset retirement obligations 
our development and exploitation capital for included a total of gross net successful wells and gross net developmental dry holes 
for  we have budgeted million for development and exploitation capital 
we currently have operated rigs drilling on the onshore continental united states with rigs in the cca  rigs in the permian basin  rigs in oklahoma  rig in north texas  and rigs in east texas 
exploration 
our expenditures for exploration investments primarily relate to drilling exploratory wells  seismic costs  delay rentals  and geological and geophysical costs 
during  our exploration capital was invested primarily in drilling extension wells in the cca and mid continent area and exploratory wells in the shallow gas zones of our acreage in north central montana 
in  our exploration capital yielded net exploratory wells that were productive and gross net exploratory dry holes 
for  we have budgeted million for exploration capital 
high pressure air injection 
in the pennel unit of the cca  we have completed phase and phase of the hpai project and are currently expanding to the phase portion of the project 
in april  we installed a new hpai facility capable of injecting million cubic feet per day into the pennel and coral creek units of the cca  giving encore the capacity to complete the development of these units 
the pennel field is responding to the air injection as expected with a barrel of oil per day increase over the forecasted production decline prior to the initiation of the project 
high pressure air injection in the little beaver unit of the cca was initiated in late  and full implementation of the project was completed in the fourth quarter of through  the program has added proved reserves of approximately million boe to the little beaver unit 
we continue to see positive production response in line with expectations with a barrel of oil per day increase over the forecasted production decline prior to the initiation of the project 
for  we have budgeted million for high pressure air injection capital 
acquisitions  leasehold and acreage costs 
the following table summarizes our costs incurred excluding asset retirement obligations for oil and natural gas property acquisitions during the year ended december  and in thousands year ended december  acquisitions leasehold acreage costs total 
table of contents acquisitions 
on october   we completed the acquisition of crusader energy corporation for a purchase price of approximately million  which includes acquired working capital 
the acquired properties are located primarily in the western anadarko basin and the golden trend area of oklahoma 
on november   we acquired oil and natural gas properties from kerr mcgee corporation for a purchase price of approximately million 
the acquired properties are located in the levelland slaughter  howard glasscock  nolley mcfarland and hutex fields in west texas and the oakdale  calumet and rush springs fields in western oklahoma 
on september   we acquired oil and natural gas properties in the williston basin for a purchase price of approximately million 
in addition to these acquisitions  we invested approximately million during in additional working interests spread over our various core areas 
acquisitions 
on april   we completed the acquisition of cortez oil gas  inc for a purchase price of approximately million 
the acquired properties are located in the cca of montana  the permian basin of west texas and southeastern new mexico  and in the mid continent area 
on june   we completed the acquisition of natural gas producing properties and undeveloped leases in the overton field located in smith county  texas for million 
we do not budget for acquisitions but we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as they arise in with the same disciplined commitment to acquire assets that fit our portfolio and continue to create value 
we will continue to pursue acquisitions of properties with similar upside potential to our current producing properties portfolio 
because of the current high oil price environment  acquiring good quality oil and natural gas properties that are predictable  exploitable  and profitable is increasingly difficult 
success in the acquisition market depends largely on the level of competition in the marketplace and the availability of properties for sale 
leasehold acreage costs 
our capital expenditures for leasehold acreage costs during the years ended december    and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
leasehold costs incurred in consist primarily of million of undeveloped leasehold costs for acreage spread over our various core areas and million related to leases acquired in the crusader acquisition 
leasehold costs incurred in relate primarily to the cortez  overton  and montana shallow gas acreage acquisitions during the year 
of the million of capital expenditures for unproved property in  million and million relate to the cortez and overton acquisitions  respectively  million relates to leases acquired in our montana shallow gas area  and the remaining million relates to unproved acreage spread over our other core areas 
for  we expect to invest million for the acquisition of leasehold acreage costs primarily in our core areas 
other general property and equipment 
our capital expenditures for other general property and equipment during the years ended december    and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures for other general property and equipment include aircraft  corporate leasehold improvements  computers  and various equipment 
for  we expect to invest million in other general property and equipment 
funding of necessary working capital 
at december   our working capital was million while at december   our working capital was million  a decrease of million 
at december   working capital was million 
the decreases from year to year are primarily attributable to changes in the fair value of outstanding derivative contracts  net of the deferred tax effect of marking these contracts to market 

table of contents for  we expect working capital to remain negative 
negative working capital is expected mainly due to fair values of our derivative contracts  the settlements of which will be offset by cash flows from the hedged production 
we anticipate cash reserves to be close to zero because we intend to use any excess cash to fund capital obligations and pay down our revolving credit facility 
we do not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the overall commodity prices and our related differentials for oil and natural gas will be the largest variable driving the different components of working capital 
our operating cash flow is determined in large part by commodity prices 
assuming moderate to high commodity prices  our operating cash flow should remain positive for the foreseeable future 
our board of directors has approved budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million for the level of these and other future expenditures is largely discretionary  and the amount of funds devoted to any particular activity may increase or decrease significantly  depending on available opportunities  timing of projects  and market conditions 
we plan to finance our ongoing expenditures using internally generated cash flow  cash on hand  and borrowings under our existing revolving credit agreement 
contractual obligations

see information presented in note long term debt to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our long term debt 
b derivative obligations represent liabilities for derivatives that were valued as of december  the ultimate settlement amounts of the remaining portions of our derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note financial instruments to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our derivative obligations 
c development commitments represent authorized purchases  million of which represents work in process and is accrued at december  at december   we had million of authorized purchases not placed to vendors authorized afes which were not accrued at year end  but are budgeted for and expected to be made during unless circumstances change 
development commitments in the above table also include future minimum payments for electricity and seismic data analysis 
d operating leases represent office space and equipment obligations that have remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year

see 
table of contents note asset retirement obligations to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our asset retirement obligations 
f subsequent to december   we entered into drilling rig commitments that require total payments of approximately million over a two year period 
other contingencies and commitments 
in order to facilitate ongoing sales of our oil production in the cca  we ship a portion of our production in pipelines downstream and sell to purchasers at major us market hubs 
from time to time  shipping delays or purchaser stipulations may require that we sell our oil production in periods subsequent to the period in which it is produced 
in such case  the deferred sale would have an adverse effect in the period of production on reported production volumes  revenues  and costs as measured on a unit of production basis 
the sale of our cca oil production is dependent on transportation through butte pipeline to markets in the guernsey  wyoming area 
to a lesser extent  our production also depends on transportation through platte pipeline to wood river  illinois as well as other pipelines connected to the guernsey  wyoming area 
while shipments on platte pipeline are currently oversubscribed and subject to apportionment since december  we have been able to move our produced volumes through platte pipeline 
however  further restrictions on the available capacity to transport through these pipelines could have a material adverse effect on price received  production volumes  and revenues 
in the fourth quarter of  the differential between our average oil wellhead price and the average nymex oil price widened 
we expect this differential to continue to widen in the first half of due to market circumstances in the rocky mountain area  which is expected to adversely affect the wellhead price we receive in the cca 
in recent years  production increases from competing canadian and rocky mountain producers  in conjunction with limited takeaway capacity from the rocky mountain area  have gradually widened the differential between our wellhead price and the benchmark nymex price at cushing  oklahoma 
a particularly active turnaround season in the first quarter of on the part of the rocky mountain area refiners has led to a further widening of the differential 
we cannot accurately predict crude oil differentials for subsequent quarters 
letters of credit 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit posted with two of our commodity derivative contract counterparties 
at any point in time  we have hedge margin deposits and letters of credit equal to the amount by which the current mark to market liability of our commodity derivative contracts exceeds the margin maintenance thresholds we have negotiated with our counterparties 
once a margin threshold is reached  we are required to maintain cash reserves in an account with the counterparty or post letters of credit in lieu of cash to ensure future settlement is made pursuant to our contracts 
these funds are released back to us as our mark to market liability decreases due to either a drop in the futures price of oil and natural gas or due to the passage of time as settlements are made 
although we did not have any margin deposits with our counterparties as of december   if commodity prices were to rise substantially  we would be required to post margin with one or more counterparties to secure future hedging settlements 
as of march   we did not have any outstanding hedge margin deposits related to our derivatives margin accounts 
as of march   we had million of outstanding letters of credit posted in lieu of cash margin deposits 
liquidity cash on hand  internally generated cash flows and the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility are our major sources of liquidity 
we also have the ability to adjust our level of capital expenditures 
we may use other sources of capital  including the issuance of additional debt securities or equity securities  to fund any major acquisitions we might secure in the future and to maintain our financial flexibility 
internally generated cash flows 
our internally generated cash flows  results of operations and financing for our operations are dependent on oil and natural gas prices and our related price differentials 
realized oil and natural gas prices for were higher as compared to these prices have 
table of contents historically fluctuated widely in response to changing market forces 
for the year ended december   approximately of our production was oil 
we believe that our cash flows and unused availability under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
to the extent oil and natural gas prices decline  our earnings  cash flows from operations  and availability under our revolving credit facility may be adversely impacted 
prolonged periods of low oil and natural gas prices could cause us to not be in compliance with covenants under our revolving credit facility and thereby affect our liquidity 
revolving credit facility 
our principal source of short term liquidity is our revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is with a bank syndicate comprised of bank of america  na and other lenders 
the borrowing base is determined semi annually and may be increased or decreased  up to a maximum of million 
the borrowing base as of december  was million 
at various times in  we amended the revolving credit facility to change the borrowing base  allow additional permitted subordinated debt  change the definition of ebitda to add back exploration expense ebitdax  increase the availability of letters of credit from of the borrowing base to  and extend the original maturity date 
the revolving credit facility matures on december  our obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by our restricted subsidiaries and secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and a pledge of the capital stock and equity interests of our restricted subsidiaries 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are subject to varying rates of interest based on the amount outstanding under the amended and restated credit facility in relation to the borrowing base and whether the loan is a eurodollar loan or a base rate loan 
the following table summarizes the calculation of the various interest rates for both eurodollar and base rate loans ratio of total outstanding to borrowing base eurodollar loans a base rate loans b less than 
to libor base rate from 
to but less than 
to libor base rate from 
to but less than

to or greater libor base rate a the libor rate is equal to the rate determined by bank of america  na to be the british bankers association interest settlement rate for deposits in dollars for a similar interest period either one  two  three or six months  or such other period as selected by encore  subject to availability at each lender 
b the base rate is calculated as the highest of the annual rate of interest announced by bank of america  na as its prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 
the borrowing base is redetermined each april and october the bank syndicate has the ability to request one additional borrowing base redetermination per year  and we are permitted to request two additional borrowing base redeterminations per year 
generally  if amounts outstanding ever exceed the borrowing base  we must reduce the amounts outstanding to the redetermined borrowing base within six months  provided that if amounts outstanding exceed the borrowing base as a result of any sale of our assets or permitted subordinated debt  we must reduce the amounts outstanding immediately upon consummation of the sale 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be repaid at anytime without penalty 
our revolving credit facility and the indentures related to our   and notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
the covenants under our revolving credit facility are similar but generally more restrictive than the covenants under the indentures 
our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to financial covenants  including leverage  interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
our revolving credit facility limits our ability to effect mergers  asset sales  and change of control events 
these 
table of contents covenants also contain restrictions regarding our ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future 
in some cases  our subsidiaries are subject to similar restrictions that may restrict their ability to make distributions to us 
the indentures related to our   and notes also contain limitations on our ability to effect mergers and change of control events  incur additional indebtedness  sell assets  declare and pay dividends or make other restricted payments  enter into transactions with affiliates and subject our assets to liens 
on december   we had million outstanding under the credit facility 
on march   we had million outstanding under the credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to our financial position or results of operations 
inflation and changes in prices our revenues  the value of our assets  and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices 
historically  significant fluctuations have occurred in oil and natural gas prices 
the following table indicates the average oil and natural gas prices received for the years ended december    and average equivalent prices for   and were decreased by   and per boe  respectively  as a result of our hedging activities 
average prices per equivalent barrel indicate the composite impact of changes in oil and natural gas prices 
natural gas production is converted to oil equivalents at the conversion rate of six mcf per bbl 
oil natural gas combined bbl mcf boe net price realization with hedges year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  average wellhead price year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  the increase in oil and natural gas prices may be accompanied by or result in increased well drilling costs  as the demand for well drilling operations continues to increase  increased severance taxes  as we are subject to higher severance taxes due to the increased value of oil and natural gas extracted from the wells  increased lease operating expenses due to increased demand for services related to operating our wells  and increased electricity costs 
we believe our risk management program and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility provide means for us to manage commodity price risks through our hedging program 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on encore s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
management has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates 

table of contents oil and natural gas properties successful efforts method 
we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all costs associated with productive and nonproductive development wells are capitalized 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals  are charged to expense as incurred 
costs associated with exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending determination of whether the well is economically productive or nonproductive 
all capitalized costs associated with both development and exploratory wells are shown as development of oil and natural gas properties in the investing activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows 
capitalized drilling costs related to exploratory wells shall continue to be capitalized if the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress has been made to assess the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
if an exploratory well does not find reserves or does not find reserves in a sufficient quantity as to make them economically producible  the previously capitalized costs are expensed as exploration expense in the consolidated statement of operations and shown as a non cash adjustment to net income in the operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows in the period in which the determination was made 
expenditures for redrilling or directional drilling in a previously abandoned well are classified as drilling costs to a proven or unproven reservoir for determination of capital or expense 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance to sustain or increase production from the existing producing reservoir are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures to recomplete a current well in a different or additional proven or unproven reservoir are capitalized pending determination that economic reserves have been added 
if the recompletion is not successful  the expenditures are charged to expense 
significant tangible equipment added or replaced is capitalized 
expenditures to construct facilities or increase the productive capacity from existing reserves are capitalized 
internal costs directly associated with the development and exploitation of properties are capitalized as a cost of the property and are classified accordingly in our consolidated financial statements 
capitalized costs are amortized on a unit of production basis over the remaining life of proved developed reserves or proved reserves  as applicable 
natural gas volumes are converted to equivalent barrels of oil at the rate of six mcf to one barrel 
unproved properties 
we adhere to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  for recognizing any impairment of capitalized costs to unproved properties 
the greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold costs 
the costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated as to recoverability  based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management 
we consider the remaining lease terms along with various subjective assumptions involving geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs 
if the assessment indicates an impairment  a loss is recognized by providing a valuation allowance 
unproved properties had a net book value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we recorded charges for unproved acreage impairment in the amounts of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
oil and natural gas reserves 
assumptions used by the independent reserve engineers in calculating reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of i the quality and quantity of available data  ii the interpretation of that data  iii the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and iv the judgment of the independent reserve engineer 
future prices received for production and future production costs may vary  perhaps significantly  from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of calculating reserve estimates 
we may not be able to develop proved reserves within the periods estimated 
furthermore  prices and costs will not remain constant 
actual production may not equal the estimated amounts used in the preparation of reserve projections 
as these estimates change  the amount of calculated reserves change 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  the property s fair value  and our depletion rate 

table of contents impairment 
impairments of proved oil and natural gas properties are directly affected by our reserve estimates 
we are required to assess the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties and other long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
if impairment is indicated based on a comparison of the asset s carrying value to its undiscounted expected future net cash flows  then it is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of management judgment  including the determination of the property s reserves  the amount and timing of future cash flows  and fair value 
asset retirement obligations 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement applies to obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction and development of the assets 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for a retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred 
for oil and natural gas properties  this is the period in which an oil or natural gas well is acquired or drilled 
the asset retirement obligation is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties at its discounted fair value 
the liability is then accreted each period until the liability is settled or the well is sold  at which time the liability is reversed 
the fair value of the liability associated with these retirement obligations is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of the plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive life of the asset and our risk adjusted costs to settle such obligations discounted using our risk adjusted interest rate  which is calculated based on comparisons of our current borrowing rate to u 
s treasury rates of a similar maturity 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
revisions to the obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to the carrying amount of the related oil and natural gas properties asset  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of the liability 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long life of most of our oil and natural gas assets  the costs to ultimately retire these assets may vary significantly from previous estimates 
depletion  depreciation  and amortization dd a 
dd a expense is directly affected by our reserve estimates 
any change in reserves directly impacts the amount of dd a expense that we recognize in a given period 
assuming no other changes  such as an increase in depreciable base  as our reserves increase  the amount of dd a expense in a given period decreases and vice versa 
changes in future commodity prices would likely result in increases or decreases in estimated recoverable reserves 
dd a expense associated with lease and well equipment and intangible drilling costs are based upon only proved developed reserves  while dd a expense for capitalized leasehold costs is based upon total proved reserves 
as a result  changes in the classification of our reserves could have a material impact on our dd a expense 
additionally  miller lents  ltd  our independent reserve engineers  estimate our reserves once a year at december as a result  quarterly reported dd a expense is based on internally prepared estimates of reserves additions and reclassifications to the december amounts prepared by miller lents  ltd 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in the purchases of cortez oil gas  inc in april and of crusader energy corporation in october see note  acquisitions 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
we performed our annual impairment test at december   and determined that no impairment existed 
if impairment is determined to exist  we will measure our impairment based on a comparison of the carrying value of goodwill to the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we would recognize an impairment charge for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we allocate the purchase price paid for the acquisition of a business to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair values of those assets and liabilities 
estimates of fair value are based 
table of contents upon  among other things  reserve estimates  anticipated future prices and costs  and expected net cash flows to be generated by a property 
these estimates are often highly subjective and may have a material impact on the amounts recorded for acquired assets and liabilities 
net profits interests a major portion of our acreage position in the cedar creek anticline is subject to net profits interests npi ranging from to 
the holders of these net profits interests are entitled to receive a fixed percentage of the cash flow remaining after specified costs have been deducted from net revenue 
the net profits calculations are contractually defined 
in general  net profits are determined after considering operating expense  overhead expense  interest expense  and drilling costs 
the amounts of reserves and production calculated to be attributable to these net profits interests are deducted from our reserves and production data  and our revenues are reported net of npi payments 
the reserves and production that are attributed to the npis are calculated by dividing estimated future npi payments in the case of reserves or prior period actual npi payments in the case of production by the commodity prices current at the determination date 
fluctuations in commodity prices and the levels of development activities in the cca from period to period will impact the reserves and production attributed to the npis and will have an inverse effect on our reported reserves and production 
based largely on a continued increase in commodity prices  we expect to make higher net profit interest payments in and possibly beyond than we have in previous years  which directly impacts our revenues  production  reserves  and net income 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized for our share of jointly owned properties as oil and natural gas is produced and sold  net of royalties and net profits interest payments 
natural gas revenues are also reduced by any processing and other fees paid except for transportation costs paid to third parties which are recorded as expense 
natural gas revenue is recorded using the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized as natural gas is sold rather than as it is produced 
royalties  net profits interests  and severance taxes are paid based upon the actual price received from the sales 
to the extent actual quantities and values of oil and natural gas are unavailable for a given reporting period because of timing or information not received from third parties  we estimate and record the expected sales volumes and price for those properties 
we also do not recognize revenue for the production in tanks  purchased oil marketed on behalf of third parties  or oil in pipelines that has not been delivered to the purchaser yet 
our net oil inventories in pipelines were  bbls and  bbls at december  and  respectively 
natural gas imbalances at december  and december   were  mmbtu over delivered to us and  mmbtu under delivered to us  respectively 
income taxes section credits 
section of the internal revenue code the code allows a percent tax credit for certain enhanced oil recovery project costs incurred in the united states 
we believe project costs incurred related to our hpai tertiary recovery project on the cca qualify under the provisions of the code and  therefore  we have reduced income tax expense by percent of project costs incurred to date 
the tax basis for the properties and related intangible drilling cost deductions and future depreciation deductions is reduced by the amount of the enhanced oil recovery tax credit 
in order to qualify for the credits a project must meet all of the following requirements the project involves the application of one or more qualified tertiary recovery methods that is reasonably expected to result in more than an insignificant increase in the amount of oil that ultimately will be recovered  the project is located within the united states  the first injection of liquids  gases  or other matter for the project occurs after december   and 
table of contents the project is certified by a petroleum engineer 
according to the code  the costs that will qualify for the credit when paid or incurred in connection with a qualifying enhanced oil recovery project include tangible property 
any amount paid for tangible property that is an integral part of a qualified enhanced oil recovery project  and with respect to which depreciation is allowable 
intangible drilling and development costs 
intangible drilling cost with respect to which the taxpayer may make an intangible drilling costs deduction election under code sec 
c 
qualified tertiary injectant expenses 
any qualified tertiary injectant expenses for which a deduction is allowable under any code section 
if our federal income tax returns are reviewed by the internal revenue service the irs  the irs could disagree with our decision and disallow a portion of the credit 
while we believe our hpai project qualifies for the tax credit and that our accounting and tracking of the costs related to the project are accurate  should the irs disagree with our position  we would be required to record additional income tax expense to the extent income tax expense has previously been reduced related to the generation of section credits 
effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate is subject to variability from period to period as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates and or changes in tax laws which can affect tax paying companies 
currently  our effective tax rate varies primarily as the amount of section income tax credits generated varies from period to period 
these credits are generated by paying or incurring certain costs in connection with a qualifying enhanced oil recovery project  such as our current high pressure air injection projects underway in the cca 
our effective tax rate is also affected by changes in the allocation of property  payroll  and revenues between states in which we own property as rates vary from state to state 
hedging and related activities we use various financial instruments for non trading purposes to manage and reduce price volatility and other market risks associated with our oil and natural gas production 
these arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to commodity price decreases  but they can also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from commodity price increases 
our risk management activity is generally accomplished through over the counter forward derivative contracts executed with large financial institutions 
we also use derivative instruments in the form of interest rate swaps  which hedge our risk related to interest rate fluctuation 
we currently recognize all of our derivative and hedging instruments in our statements of financial position as either assets or liabilities and measure them at fair value 
if a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting  it must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
however  if a derivative does qualify for hedge accounting  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value can be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting  the cash flows from the hedging instrument must be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows due to changes in the underlying items being hedged 
in addition  all hedging relationships must be designated  documented  and reassessed periodically 
most of our derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting 
cash flow hedges are marked to market through comprehensive income each quarter 
currently  all of our derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges are designated as cash flow hedges 
these instruments hedge the exposure of variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk 
the effective portion of the mark to market gain or loss on these derivative instruments is recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
any 
table of contents ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized as derivative fair value gain loss in the consolidated statements of operations immediately 
while management does not anticipate changing the designation of any of our current derivative contracts as hedges  factors beyond our control can preclude the use of hedge accounting 
one example would be variability in the nymex price for oil or natural gas  upon which many of our commodity derivative contracts are based  that does not coincide with changes in the spot price for oil and natural gas that we are paid 
as previously discussed  we expect the differential between our average oil wellhead price and the average nymex oil price to widen in the first half of due to market circumstances in the rocky mountain area  which is expected to adversely affect the wellhead price we receive in the cca 
this factor will result in additional ineffectiveness on hedges designated on our rocky mountain production and could ultimately preclude the use of hedge accounting 
assuming constant prices and based on our hedged position as of december   a and increase in the oil and natural gas wellhead differentials would result in increases to our derivative fair value loss in of approximately and  respectively 
another example would be if the counterparty to a derivative contract was deemed no longer creditworthy and non performance under the terms of the contract was likely 
to the extent our derivative contracts are not designated as hedges  high earnings volatility can result  as any future changes in the market value of the contract would then be marked to market through earnings 
new accounting standards statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb sfas no 
r eliminates the option of using the intrinsic value method of accounting previously available  and requires companies to recognize in the financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the effective date of sfas no 
r is january  for calendar year companies 
sfas no 
r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r  for all share based payments granted after that date  and for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r 
under the modified retrospective method  the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method  but it also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with sfas no 
we plan to adopt the requirements of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options when calculating the pro forma effect of applying the fair value provisions of sfas no 
while sfas no 
r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a lattice model 
we plan to continue using a black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of employee stock options upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas no 
will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas no 
r also requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options and our stock price at that time 

table of contents in we expect to record total expense related to stock options granted prior to january  of approximately million 
we have not yet determined the financial statement impact of adopting sfas no 
r for options granted subsequent to december  because they depend on  among other things  the number of options granted in the future and our future stock price 
fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
the interpretation clarifies the requirement to record abandonment liabilities stemming from legal obligations when the retirement depends on a conditional future event 
fin no 
requires that the uncertainty about the timing or method of settlement of a conditional retirement obligation be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
we adopted fin no 
as of december  there was no material impact on our results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
fasb staff position  accounting for suspended well costs 
we adopted fasb staff position fsp accounting for suspended well costs on july  fsp amends sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  to permit the continued capitalization of exploratory well costs beyond one year if the well found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
upon the adoption of fsp  we evaluated all existing capitalized exploratory well costs and determined that there was no impact on our results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
see note capitalization of exploratory well costs to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding fsp statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no

 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 

sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
also requires that retrospective application of a change in accounting principle be limited to the direct effects of the change 
indirect effects of a change in accounting principle should be recognized in the period of the accounting change 
sfas no 
will become effective for our fiscal year beginning january  the impact of sfas no 
will depend on the nature and extent of any voluntary accounting changes and correction of errors after the effective date  but we do not currently expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
emerging issues task force eitf issue accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty 
the emerging issues task force considered issue no 
in its may  and june  meetings to discuss inventory sales to another entity in the same line of business from which it also purchases inventory 
the task force reached consensus on the issue that purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty should be combined as a single nonmonetary transaction net and noted factors that may indicate that transactions were entered into in contemplation of one another 
the task force also concluded that transfers of finished goods inventory in exchange for work in progress or raw materials should be recognized at fair value and prescribes additional disclosures 
the task force ratified issue no 
at its september  meeting  which should be applied to new arrangements entered into in the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after march  we have previously reported transactions of this nature on a net basis  therefore  we do not expect issue no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
information concerning forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements  which give our current expectations or forecasts of future events

you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
such statements involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the matters discussed above under the caption item a

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging policy 
we have adopted a formal hedging policy 
the purpose of our hedging program is to mitigate the negative effects of declining commodity prices on our business 
we plan to continue in the normal course of business to hedge our exposure to fluctuating commodity prices 
however  not all of our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and in some instances management has determined it is more cost effective not to designate certain derivatives as hedges 
in very limited circumstances  the company may enter into derivative financial instruments to achieve other goals besides risk reduction 
one example would be the use of a fixed to floating interest rate swap to offset interest expense on fixed rate debt 
the company weighs the increased risk of the instrument versus the potential cash flow savings before entering into any derivative instrument designed to achieve any goal other than risk reduction 

table of contents counterparties 
our counterparties to hedging contracts include bnp paribas  calyon  deutsche bank  mitsui co  morgan stanley  shell trading  wachovia  j 
aron company  bp products  bank of america  and koch supply and trading 
at december   our hedged oil and natural gas production was committed to the counterparties as follows percentage of percentage of hedged oil hedged natural production gas production counterparty committed committed bnp paribas calyon deutsche bank j 
aron company morgan stanley wachovia performance on all of our contracts with j 
aron company is guaranteed by its parent  goldman sachs co 
we feel the credit worthiness of our current counterparties is sound and we do not anticipate any non performance of contractual obligations 
as long as each counterparty maintains an investment grade credit rating  pursuant to our hedging contracts  no collateral is required 
in order to mitigate the credit risk of financial instruments  we enter into master netting agreements with significant counterparties 
the master netting agreement is a standardized  bilateral contract between a given counterparty and us 
instead of treating separately each financial transaction between our counterparty and us  the master netting agreement enables our counterparty and us to aggregate all financial trades and treat them as a single agreement 
this arrangement benefits us in three ways 
first  the netting of the value of all trades reduces the requirements of daily collateral posting by us 
second  default by counterparty under one financial trade can trigger rights for us to terminate all financial trades with such counterparty 
third  netting of settlement amounts reduces our credit exposure to a given counterparty in the event of close out 
commodity price sensitivity 
the tables in this section provide information about derivative financial instruments to which we were a party as of december  that are sensitive to changes in oil and natural gas commodity prices 
we hedge commodity price risk with swap contracts  put contracts  and collar contracts 
swap contracts provide a fixed price for a notional amount of sales volumes 
put contracts provide a fixed floor price on a notional amount of sales volumes while allowing full price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price 
collar contracts provide a floor price on a notional amount of sales volumes while allowing some additional price participation if the relevant index price closes above the floor price 
additionally  we may occasionally sell short put contracts with a strike price well below the floor price of the collar 
these short put contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas  and accordingly  the mark to market change in the value of these contracts is recorded as fair value gain loss in the statements of operations 
thus  not all of our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and in some instances management has determined it is more cost effective not to designate certain derivatives as hedges 
the unrealized mark to market loss on our outstanding commodity derivatives at december  was approximately million 
as of december   the fair market value of our oil derivative contracts designated as hedges was million and the fair market value of our natural gas derivative contracts designated as hedges was million

interest rate sensitivity 
at december   we had total long term debt of million  which is recorded net of discount of million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of  million bears interest at a fixed rate of  and million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the remaining outstanding long term debt balance of million is under our revolving credit facility and is subject to floating market rates of interest that are linked to libor 
at this level of floating rate debt  if the libor rate increased  we would incur an additional million of interest expense per year  and if the rate decreased  we would incur million less 
additionally  if the libor rate increased  we estimate the fair value of our fixed rate debt at december  would decrease from million to million  and if the rate decreased  we estimate the fair value would increase to million

proved developed reserves 
reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved reserves 
the estimated quantities of oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 

table of contents proved undeveloped reserves 
proved undeveloped reserves are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells drilled to known reservoirs on acreage yet to be drilled for which the existence and recoverability of such reserves can be estimated with reasonable certainty  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required to establish production 
proved undeveloped reserves include unrealized production response from fluid injection and other improved recovery techniques  such as high pressure air injection  where such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir
