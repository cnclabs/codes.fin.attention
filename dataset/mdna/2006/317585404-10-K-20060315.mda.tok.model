the company realized a net gain of million on the ultimate sale or settlement of these commercial related loans held for sale 
see additional discussion of loans held for sale and commercial related loan sale results in the lending activities section 
the provision for loan losses has had a significant impact on earnings the last three years totaling million  million and million for the years ended december   and the provision for loan losses recorded during resulted from the company s decision to sell a portion of its criticized and classified commercial related loans

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and are consistent with predominant practices in the financial services industry 
application of critical accounting policies  which are those policies that management believes are the most important to the company s financial position and results  requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
the company has numerous accounting policies  of which the most significant are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses are reported in the consolidated financial statements and how those reported amounts are determined 
based on the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that the accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses and goodwill require particularly subjective or complex judgments important to the company s financial position and results of operations  and  as such  are considered to be critical accounting policies as discussed below 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications of loans  changes in the nature of the loan portfolio  industry concentrations and the impact of current local  regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity

 goodwill and other intangible assets prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas no 
discontinue the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
instead  these assets are subject to at least an annual impairment review  and more frequently if certain impairment indicators are in evidence 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate impairment may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
during and  the company evaluated goodwill for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis and determined no impairment existed

table of contents analysis of allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents the estimated amount of probable credit losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
the company performs periodic  systematic reviews of the bank s loan portfolio to estimate probable losses in the respective loan portfolios 
in addition  the company regularly evaluates prevailing economic and business conditions  industry concentrations  changes in the size and characteristics of the portfolio and other pertinent factors 
the process used by the company to determine the overall allowance for loan losses is based on this analysis 
based on this analysis the company believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate at december  assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves substantial uncertainties and is based upon management s evaluation of the amounts required to meet estimated charge offs in the loan portfolio after weighing various factors 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is subject to ongoing management review 
the company previously reported that as of december   it had identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to determining the allowance for loan losses and the provision for loan losses 
the company has taken various corrective actions  as described in part ii  item a  controls and procedures  to remediate the material weakness condition 
at december   it is the company s opinion that the material weakness has been remediated 
while management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review a financial institution s allowance for loan losses and carrying amounts of other real estate owned 
such agencies may require the financial institution to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination

and 
the remaining portfolios of commercial  commercial real estate  agricultural and agricultural real estate loans are segmented into the following loan classification categories uncriticized or pass  special mention  and substandard 
the substandard category of loans greater than  is then further divided into two groupings based on an assessment of the individual loan s collateralization levels ie under collateralized or adequately collateralized 
loans under collateralized by less than of the outstanding loan balance are treated the same as adequately collateralized loans 
the substandard loans where the collateral deficiency is greater than are split into loans with outstanding loan balances of million or more and loans with outstanding loan balances under million 
the inherent risk of loss in each of these two groupings of loans is estimated based upon historical net loan charge off considerations  review of the amount of under collateralization of the loans in the respective groupings  as well as other qualitative factors 
prior to the fourth quarter of these groups of loans were considered in the aggregate with all substandard loans as described in the following paragraph related to adequately collateralized substandard loans 
uncriticized loans  special mention loans  adequately collateralized substandard loans and all substandard loans under  are assigned allowance allocations based on historical net loan charge off experience for each of the respective loan categories  supplemented with additional reserve amounts  if considered necessary  based upon qualitative factors 
these qualitative factors include the levels and trends in delinquencies  nonaccrual loans  and risk ratings  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policy  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic conditions  and concentrations of credit  among others 

table of contents the consumer loan portfolio is segmented into six types of loans residential real estate  home equity lines of credit  consumer direct  consumer indirect  overdrafts and personal lines of credit 
each of those categories is subdivided into categories based on delinquency status  either days and over past due or under days 
allowance allocations on these types of loans are based on the average loss experience over the last three years for each subdivision of delinquency status supplemented with qualitative factors containing the same elements as described above 
a further component of the allowance is the unallocated portion which takes into consideration the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio not identified in the other three categories and includes such elements as risks associated with variances in the rate of historical loss experiences  information risks associated with the dependence upon timely and accurate risk ratings on loans  and risks associated with the dependence on collateral valuation techniques 
this category has been reduced from the previous year due to a reduction in these risks primarily resulting from the problem loan sale discussed previously 
while management evaluates currently available information in establishing the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluations 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review a financial institution s allowance for loan losses and carrying amounts of other real estate owned 
such agencies may require the financial institution to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination

the fluctuation in income tax expense corresponds in general with taxable income levels for each year 
the effective tax rate for was  compared to in the lower effective tax rate in is primarily attributable to tax exempt interest income constituting a larger proportion of income before income tax expense

the increase in return ratios resulted from the combination of a million decrease in provision for loan losses  a  decrease in noninterest income and a  decrease in noninterest expense 
net interest income for the fourth quarter of declined million compared to the same quarter last year  or  to million primarily the result of a basis point drop in average net interest margin  a million reduction in average earning assets coupled with a change in the mix of those earning assets from higher yielding loan assets into lower yielding investment assets

noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of was million  a decrease from million in the fourth quarter of salaries and benefits declined million to million in the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter last year 
the decline was a result of staff reductions associated with the merger and a reversal of certain bonus and incentive accruals due to full year financial results 
other noninterest expense increased  to million in the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter last year 
this increase in other noninterest expenses is partially due to one time restructuring costs incurred in the fourth quarter of average deposits were down for the fourth quarter to billion in comparison to the same quarter last year 
a majority of the decline in deposits relates to certificates of deposit  including brokered certificates of deposit  as the company actively managed to lower the level of these higher cost deposits due to the higher liquidity levels resulting from the decline in loans 
total loans declined to million as of december  compared with billion at the end of the prior year 
the sale of commercial related problem loans and tighter credit administration policies are the principal causes for the reduced loan levels 
nonperforming assets at december  were million compared with million at september   and million at the december  this decline from the prior year was primarily a result of the sale of commercial related problem loans in the sale of commercial related problem loans during the year significantly reduced the ratio of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned to of total loans and other real estate owned compared with at december  the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans at december  also measurably improved to compared with at the same time in the prior year 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity the objective of maintaining adequate liquidity is to assure the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to meet their financial obligations 
these obligations include the withdrawal of deposits on demand or at their contractual maturity  the repayment of borrowings as they mature  the ability to fund new and existing loan commitments and the ability to take advantage of new business opportunities 
the company and its subsidiaries achieve liquidity by maintaining a strong base of core customer funds  maturing short term assets  the ability to sell securities  lines of credit  and access to capital markets 
liquidity at the bank level is managed through the monitoring of anticipated changes in loans  the investment portfolio  core deposits and wholesale funds 
the strength of the bank s liquidity position is a result of its base of core customer deposits 
these core deposits are supplemented by wholesale funding sources that include credit lines with the other banking institutions  the fhlb and the federal reserve bank 
the primary source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends from the bank  lines of credit including the m t loan  and access to capital markets 
dividends from the bank are limited by various regulatory requirements related to capital adequacy and earnings trends 
the company s bank relies on cash flows from operations  core deposits  borrowings  short term liquid assets  and  in the case of non banking subsidiaries  funds from the parent company 
see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  which is incorporated herein by reference 
the company s cash and cash equivalents were million at december   an increase of million from million at december  the company s net cash provided by operating activities totaled million 
the principal source of operating activity cash flow was the company s net income adjusted for noncash income and expenses items  which together accounted for approximately million of net cash flow 
the company utilized its cash in investing activities through the net acquisition of million in securities and million in premises and equipment 
net cash provided from investment activities included million of loan payments in excess of loan originations  million generated from the sale of commercial related loans and million from the sale of the discontinued subsidiary

the commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
at december  stand by letters of credit totaling million and unused loan commitments of million were contractually available 
comparable amounts for these commitments at december  were million and million  respectively 
the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements as many of the commitments are expected to expire without funding

the company also extends rate lock agreements to borrowers related to the origination of residential mortgage loans 
to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in these rate lock agreements  as well as closed mortgage loans held for sale  the company enters into forward commitments to sell individual mortgage loans 
rate lock agreements and forward commitments are considered derivatives and are recorded at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
at december   the total notional amount of these derivatives rate lock agreements and forward commitments held by the company amounted to million 
capital resources the frb has adopted a system using risk based capital guidelines to evaluate the capital adequacy of bank holding companies 
the guidelines require a minimum total risk based capital ratio of 
leverage ratio is also utilized in assessing capital adequacy with a minimum requirement that can range from to

the company s total risk based capital ratio was at december   up from at december  total risk based capital was million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  the improvement in the risk based capital ratio is the result of a significant change in the company s asset composition 
as a result of the company s commercial related loan sale in and other declines in loans  coupled with an increase in investment securities  the company has a significantly higher percentage of its assets in lower risk weight investment securities and a smaller percentage of higher risk weighted loans 
recent accounting developments in november  the fasb issued staff position no 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments the fsp 
the fsp addresses the determination of when an investment is considered impaired  whether the impairment is other than temporary  and how to measure an impairment loss 
the fsp also addresses accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment on a debt security  and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
the fsp replaces the impairment guidance in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
with references to existing authoritative literature concerning other than temporary determinations principally sfas no 
and sec staff accounting bulletin 
under the fsp  impairment losses must be recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security s cost and its fair value at the financial statement date  without considering partial recoveries subsequent to that date 
the fsp requires that an investor recognize an other than temporary impairment loss when it determines that an impaired security will not fully recover prior to the expected time of sale or maturity

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal objective of the company s interest rate risk management is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities  determine the appropriate level of risk to the company given its business strategy  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the company s board of directors 
the company s senior management is responsible for reviewing with the board its activities and strategies  the effect of those strategies on the net interest margin  the fair value of the portfolio and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on the portfolio and exposure limits 
senior management develops an asset liability policy that meets strategic objectives and regularly reviews the activities of the bank 
net interest income at risk analysis the primary tool the company uses to manage interest rate risk is a rate shock simulation to measure the rate sensitivity of the balance sheet 
rate shock simulation is a modeling technique used to estimate the impact of changes in rates on net interest income and economic value of equity 
the following table sets forth the results of the modeling analysis at december  dollars in thousands change in interest rates in basis points net interest income economic value of equity rate shock amount change change amount change change static the company measures net interest income at risk by estimating the changes in net interest income resulting from instantaneous and sustained parallel shifts in interest rates of different magnitudes over a period of months 
as of december   a basis point increase in rates would decrease net interest income by  or  over the next twelve month period 
a basis point decrease in rates would decrease net interest income by million  or  over a twelve month period 
as of december   a basis point increase in rates would decrease the economic value of equity by million  or  over the next twelve month period 
a basis point decrease in rates would increase the economic value of equity by million  or  over a twelve month period 
this simulation is based on management s assumption as to the effect of interest rate changes on assets and liabilities and assumes a parallel shift of the yield curve 
it also includes certain assumptions about the future pricing of loans and deposits in response to changes in interest rates 
further  it assumes that delinquency rates would not change as a result of changes in interest rates  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
while this simulation is a useful measure as to net interest income at risk due to a change in interest rates  it is not a forecast of the future results and is based on many assumptions that  if changed  could cause a different outcome 
in addition to the changes in interest rate scenarios listed above  the company typically runs other scenarios to measure interest rate risk  which vary as deemed appropriate as the economic and interest rate environments change 

table of contents gap analysis the following table the gap table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which management anticipates  based upon certain assumptions  to re price or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which re price or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the re pricing date or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth an approximation of the projected re pricing of assets and liabilities on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments within the selected time intervals 
all non maturity deposits demand deposits and savings deposits are subject to immediate withdrawal and are therefore shown to re price in the period of less than days 
prepayment and re pricing rates can have a significant impact on the estimated gap 
the results shown are based on numerous assumptions and there can be no assurance that the presented results will approximate actual future activity 
dollars in thousands december  volumes subject to repricing within non days days days years years years sensitive total interest earning assets federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits investment securities loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking  savings and money market deposits certificates of deposit borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities amounts shown include the amortized cost of held to maturity securities and the fair value of available for sale securities 
amounts shown include loans held for sale and are net of unearned income and net deferred fees and costs 
amounts shown include junior subordinated debentures 
for purposes of interest rate risk management  the company directs more attention on simulation modeling  such as net interest income at risk as previously discussed  rather than gap analysis 
the net interest income at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk
