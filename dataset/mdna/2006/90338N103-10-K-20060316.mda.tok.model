item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are the fifth largest publicly traded truckload carrier in the united states  measured by revenue 
our primary business is offering a broad range of truckload services to customers throughout the united states and in portions of canada and mexico 
we also offer transportation  warehousing  and distribution services to the floorcovering industry 
since becoming a public company  we have increased our operating revenue to billion in from million in  a compounded annual growth rate of 
our growth has come through expansion of business with new and existing customers  complementary acquisitions  and through the development and expansion of additional strategic business units 
recent results of operations and year end financial condition during  a favorable relationship between industry wide demand and capacity allowed significant increases in rates 
however  in the first half of the year  industry wide cost increases  primarily as a result of higher driver compensation and fuel costs  fluctuating freight demand  and poor results in our xpress global systems segment caused financial results to be lower than expected 
following the sale of the airport to airport division of xpress global systems in the second quarter of and the elimination of costs related to that division  the continued allocation of assets to more successful strategic business units  and seasonally stronger demand  we produced the highest quarterly earnings per share since our initial public offering during the fourth quarter of for the year ended december   our key operating statistics versus were as follows our average revenue per loaded mile  before fuel surcharge  increased to from  our average revenue per tractor per week  before fuel surcharge  increased to  from  our operating ratio was in and in our operating strategy is to allocate our truckload assets to business units with greater profitability and improve the profitability of each business unit 
our primary area of focus initially has been on improving our business units yield management and asset productivity 
we seek to do this by raising freight rates where justified and also replacing less profitable freight 
in this process  we evaluate rates  non revenue miles  miles per tractor  the total time our assets are committed to the freight movement  the efficiency of our equipment positioning before and after the movement  total costs associated with the movement  drivers domiciles and preferences  the overall customer relationship  and other factors 
based on our criteria  our sales and operations personnel work together to select more profitable freight 
we were able to modestly increase revenues through increased pricing in due to stronger freight demand and a better rate environment in the latter part of primarily due to continued growth in the us economy and a favorable relationship between demand and trucking capacity 
this contributed to higher average revenue per tractor per week excluding fuel surcharge  which increased to  in from  in  and a increase in average revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge to from 
the increase in pricing was countered by a significant increase in costs  primarily attributable to increases in driver compensation  costs of revenue equipment  insurance and claims  and fuel prices 
these factors  together with a million operating loss in our xpress global systems segment caused our net income to decline to million in  from million in at december   our balance sheet reflected stockholders equity of million and million in aggregate borrowings  including current maturities and the securitization facility 
our truckload segment our truckload segment  us xpress  which comprised approximately of our total operating revenue in  includes the following four strategic business units  each of which is significant in its market 
dedicated our approximately  tractor dedicated unit offers our customers dedicated equipment  drivers  and on site personnel to address customers needs for committed capacity and service levels  while affording us consistent equipment utilization during the contract term 
regional and solo over the road our approximately  tractor regional and solo over the road unit offers our customers a high level of service in dense freight markets of the southeast  midwest and west  in addition to providing nationwide coverage 
expedited intermodal rail our railroad contracts for high speed train service enable us to provide our customers incremental capacity and transit times comparable to solo driver service in medium to long haul markets  while lowering our costs 
expedited team our approximately team driver unit offers our customers a service advantage over medium to long haul rail and solo driver truck service at a much lower cost than airfreight  while affording us premium rates and improved utilization of equipment 
over the past few years we have been reallocating our truckload assets to business units that we expect to be more profitable 
this has resulted in significant growth in the percentage of our revenue contributed by dedicated and expedited intermodal rail services and a decrease in the percentage of our revenue contributed by our regional and solo over the road service 
in addition  the asset reallocation has affected the comparability of certain operating measures 
for example  we are generating higher average revenue per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharge  offset by an increase in non revenue miles and a decrease in miles per tractor 
in general  shorter hauls pay higher rates per mile but generate fewer miles per unit and involve a greater percentage of non revenue miles for re positioning the tractor for the next load 
our operating measures may continue to change as we continue to execute our strategy 
our xpress global systems segment our xpress global systems segment accounted for approximately of our total operating revenue in approximately of our total revenue was attributed to the floorcovering division that offers transportation  warehousing  and distribution services for the floorcovering industry  and was attributed to the airport to airport division  which we sold and exited in the second quarter of during the year ended december   our xpress global systems segment experienced an operating loss of million  which includes a million charge for the sale and exit from the airport to airport business 
revenue and expenses we primarily generate revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid a predetermined rate per mile for our services 
we enhance our revenue by charging for tractor and trailer detention  loading and unloading activities  and other specialized services  as well as through the collection of fuel surcharges to mitigate the impact of increases in the cost of fuel 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  and the number of shipments and miles we generate 
these factors relate  among other things  to the general level of economic activity in the areas in which we operate  inventory levels  specific customer demand  the level of capacity in the trucking industry  and driver availability 
our primary measures of revenue generation are average revenue per loaded mile and average revenue per tractor per week  in each case excluding fuel surcharge revenue 
average revenue per loaded mile  before fuel surcharge revenue  increased to in  from in  and in average revenue per tractor per week improved to  in  from  in  and  in the main factors that impact our profitability in terms of expenses are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and purchased transportation expenses  which include compensating independent contractors and providers of expedited intermodal rail services 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed costs are the acquisition and financing costs  including depreciation  of long term assets  such as revenue equipment and terminal facilities and the compensation of non driver personnel 
the primary measure we use to evaluate our profitability is operating ratio operating expenses  net of fuel surcharge  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge 
our operating ratio was in and in revenue equipment at december   we had a truckload fleet of  tractors  which included independent contractors 
we also operated  trailers in our truckload fleet and approximately tractors dedicated to local and drayage services 
consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationships of expense items to total revenue  excluding fuel surcharge  for each of the fiscal years indicated below 
fuel surcharge revenue is offset against fuel and fuel taxes 
we believe that eliminating the impact of this source of revenue provides a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period 
year ended december  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits fuel and fuel taxes vehicle rents depreciation and amortization purchased transportation operating expense and supplies insurance premiums and claims operating taxes and licenses communications and utilities general and other operating expenses early extinguishment of debt loss on sale and exit of business total operating expenses income from operations interest expense  net equity in income of affiliated companies income before income tax provision income tax provision net income comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december total revenue increased to billion from billion for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge  and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because we believe that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  in addition to absolute dollar changes  because we believe the high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful at times than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  remained essentially constant at billion in and us xpress revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million in compared to million in  due primarily to an increase of in average revenue per loaded mile to from 
the increase in average revenue per loaded mile was primarily due to increased rates and from growth in dedicated operations  which generally provide for a shorter length of haul and higher rate per mile  the shortage of truck capacity in many geographic markets creating a stronger truck demand  and increases in tractor and trailer detention revenues 
these gains were partially offset by a decline in average tractors and a reduction in revenue miles per tractor 
xpress global systems revenue decreased to million in compared to million in due primarily to the sale and exit from the airport to airport business in the second quarter of within xpress global systems  floorcovering revenue decreased to million due primarily to a decreased volume of freight 
intersegment revenue increased to million in compared to million in salaries  wages and benefits increased to million in compared to million in as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  salaries  wages and benefits increased to in  compared to in the increase was primarily due to a driver wage increase implemented in the fourth quarter of  an increase in the number of local drivers necessary to support our expedited intermodal rail program  and an increase in health insurance costs and workers compensation claims  offset by decreases in non driver personnel related to the sale and exit of the airport to airport business 
fuel and fuel taxes  net of fuel surcharge  decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to increased fuel surcharges paid to railroads and owner operators reflected in purchased transportation combined with a decrease in company miles 
including the effect of fuel surcharge paid to rail roads and owner operators  fuel and fuel taxes  net of fuel surcharge  increased to million in compared to million in our cost per company mile increased approximately 
this increase was primarily due to the increase in the average fuel price per gallon of approximately combined with the lower efficiency of the new epa compliant engines  offset by an increase in customer fuel surcharges 
vehicle rents decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the average number of tractors financed under operating leases to  compared to  during and  respectively 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average number of trailers financed under operating leases to  compared to  during and  respectively  due to the expansion of our trailer fleet necessary to support the expedited intermodal rail program 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  vehicle rents were in compared to in depreciation and amortization increased to million in compared to million in gains realized on the sale of revenue equipment are included in depreciation and amortization for reporting purposes 
depreciation and amortization  excluding gains increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average number of owned tractors to  compared to  during and  respectively  increased costs of the new epa compliant engines  and increased depreciation and amortization related to computer hardware and software 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average numbers of owned trailers to  from  during and as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  depreciation and amortization increased to in compared to in purchased transportation decreased to million in compared to million in primarily due to the sale and exit of the airport to airport business  and a decrease in the average number of owner operators in the truckload segment in to  or of the total fleet  compared to  or of the total fleet  in this decrease was offset by the increased use in expedited intermodal rail in the truckload segment for certain medium to long haul truckload freight 
as a result of the foregoing  purchased transportation decreased as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  to in from in operating expense and supplies increased to million in compared to million in  primarily due to an increase in tractor maintenance costs 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  operating expense and supplies were in compared to in this is partially offset by certain expenses being eliminated with the sale and exit of the airport to airport business 
insurance premiums and claims  consisting primarily of premium and deductible amounts for liability personal injury and property damage  physical damage and cargo damage insurance and claims  decreased to million in compared to million in as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  insurance and premiums and claims expense decreased to in compared to in  primarily due to the decrease in liability and physical damage premiums and claims expense offset by the increase in cargo claims expense 
we are self insured up to certain limits for cargo loss  physical damage and liability 
we have adopted an insurance program with higher deductible exposure to offset the industry wide increase in insurance premium rates 
as of december   the retention level for cargo loss was thousand and the retention level for liability was million per occurrence 
we maintain insurance with licensed insurance companies above amounts for which we are self insured for cargo and liability 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of pending claims  plus any incurred but not reported claims 
the accruals are estimated based on our evaluation of the type and severity of individual claims and future development based on historical trends 
insurance premiums and claims expense will fluctuate based on claims experience  premium rates and self insurance retention levels 
the loss on sale and exit of business was million in the second quarter of refer to 
footnote  loss on sale and exit of business in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
equity in income of affiliated companies was million in compared to thousand in this is the result of the company recording equity in the earnings of arnold transportation services  inc  which was acquired in december  and total transportation of mississippi  which was acquired in april  during refer to 
footnote  equity and cost investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in average borrowings to million in from million in see 
footnote  long term debt and 
footnote  accounts receivable securitization  of our consolidated financial statements for further details 
the effective tax rate was for the fiscal year 
the rate is higher than the statutory rate of  primarily as a result of per diems paid to drivers which are not fully deductible for federal income tax purposes 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december total revenue increased to billion from million for total revenue included million of fuel surcharge revenue in and million of fuel surcharge revenue in in discussing our results of operations we use revenue  before fuel surcharge  and fuel expense  net of surcharge  because we believe that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
we also discuss the changes in our expenses as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  in addition to absolute dollar changes  because we believe the high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful at times than absolute dollar changes 
revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to billion in compared to million in us xpress revenue  before fuel surcharge  increased to million in compared to million in  due primarily to an increase of in average revenue per loaded mile to from 
the increase in average revenue per loaded mile was primarily due to increased rates and from growth in regional and dedicated operations  which generally provide for a shorter length of haul and higher rate per mile 
xpress global systems revenue increased to million in compared to million in within xpress global systems  floorcovering revenue increased to million due primarily to an increase in revenue per pound of  and airport to airport revenue increased to million  due primarily to revenue generated from acquisitions of airport to airport operations in july and october intersegment revenue decreased to million in compared to million in  due to xpress global systems increased use of third party carriers for truckload services combined with the introduction of owner operators to xpress global systems airport to airport operations 
salaries  wages and benefits increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to driver pay increases of approximately and in the first and fourth quarters of  respectively  an increase in the number of local drivers necessary to support our expedited intermodal rail program  and growth in non driver personnel as a result of the increased volume of business in both of our business segments 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  salaries  wages and benefits decreased to in  compared to in primarily due to the increase in average revenue per loaded mile which more than offset increases in driver and non driver compensation 
fuel and fuel taxes  net of fuel surcharge  increased to million in compared to million in the increase was due primarily to an approximate increase in the average fuel price per gallon  combined with the lower fuel efficiency of the new epa compliant engines 
these factors were partially offset by collection of fuel surcharges and a decline in company miles 
our exposure to increases in fuel prices is predominately mitigated by fuel surcharges to its customers  which amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  fuel and fuel taxes  net of fuel surcharge  declined to in compared to in primarily because of the increase in average revenue per loaded mile  combined with an increase in the use of expedited intermodal rail for certain medium to long haul truckload freight 
vehicle rents decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the average number of tractors financed under operating leases to  compared to  during and  respectively 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average number of trailers financed under operating leases to  compared to  during and  respectively  due to the expansion of our trailer fleet necessary to support the expedited intermodal rail program 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  vehicle rents were in compared to in primarily due to a larger portion of the fleet being financed through debt instead of operating leases  combined with an increase in average revenue per tractor  which more effectively covered this fixed cost 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in the average number of owned tractors and trailers to  and  respectively  in compared to  and  respectively  in  as well as increased cost of the new epa compliant engines and lower residual values 
the increased depreciation and amortization reflects our decision to finance our fleet additions with debt versus operating leases  combined with the expansion of our trailer fleet necessary to support the expedited intermodal rail program 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  depreciation and amortization remained relatively consistent at in compared to in despite the increase in tractors and trailers financed through debt instead of operating leases primarily due to the increase in average revenue per tractor  which more effectively covered this fixed cost 
purchased transportation increased to million in compared to million in primarily due to the increased use of expedited intermodal rail in the truckload segment for certain medium to long haul truckload freight and an owner operator pay increase of approximately initiated in february this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average number of owner operators in the truckload segment in to  or of the total fleet  compared to  or of the total fleet  in xpress global systems purchased transportation increased approximately due to higher line haul costs  resulting from higher fuel costs and tight capacity in the truckload industry and the introduction of owner operators to xpress global systems airport to airport operations 
xpress global systems number of owner operators was approximately at december  compared to none in as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  purchased transportation increased to in compared to in primarily due to the growth in the expedited intermodal rail program and increased line haul costs at xpress global systems  which more than offset a decline in the percentage of our tractor fleet being provided by owner operators and the increase in average revenue per loaded mile 
operating expense and supplies increased to million in compared to million in  primarily due to an increase in driver recruiting and retention costs 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  operating expense and supplies were in compared to in as increases in average revenue per loaded mile and per tractor more than offset these increased costs 
insurance premiums and claims  consisting primarily of premiums and deductible amounts for liability personal injury and property damage  physical damage and cargo damage insurance and claims  increased to million in compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher insurance premiums and a million increase in liability expense  due in part to an approximately million increase in the provision for current year claims combined with an increase in adverse development related to prior year claims  due in part to the settlement of certain large claims 
the increase in liability claims was partially offset by a decrease in physical damage and cargo claims 
as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  insurance and premiums and claims expense was in compared to in at december   the retention level for cargo loss was thousand and the retention level for liability was million per occurrence 
we maintain insurance with licensed insurance companies above amounts for which we are self insured for cargo and liability 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of pending claims  plus any incurred but not reported claims 
the accruals are estimated based on our evaluation of the type and severity of individual claims and future development based on historical trends 
additionally  the results of a third party actuarial study were also utilized in establishing the december  liability reserve 
insurance premiums and claims expense will fluctuate based on claims experience  premium rates and self insurance retention levels 
interest expense decreased thousand  or  to million in compared to million in the decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in average borrowings  combined with a decrease in the weighted average interest rate to in compared to in see footnote  long term debt and footnote  accounts receivable securitization  of our consolidated financial statements for further details 
the effective tax rate was for the fiscal year 
the rate is higher than the statutory rate of  primarily as a result of per diems paid to drivers which are not fully deductible for federal income tax purposes 
we initiated the per diem driver pay plan in february see footnote  income taxes  of our consolidated financial statements for further details 
liquidity and capital resources our business requires significant capital investments 
our primary sources of liquidity at december  were funds provided by operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  proceeds from our accounts receivable securitization facility  and long term equipment debt and operating leases of revenue equipment 
both our revolving credit facility and our accounts receivable securitization facility has maximum available borrowings of million 
we believe that funds provided by operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and securitization facility  equipment installment loans and long term equipment debt and operating lease financing will be sufficient to fund our cash needs and anticipated capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
cash flows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash generated from operations increased million during as compared to the increase was due primarily to increased revenues in the fourth quarter of to million from million in the fourth quarter of creating a significant increase in the trade receivable balance as of december  the revenues during the fourth quarter of of million were consistent with the revenues in the fourth quarter of as were the trade receivables as of december  and december  these increases in net cash provided by operating activities are partially offset by a decrease in earnings to million in as compared to million in  and changes in other assets 
cash used in investing activities was million during compared to million in the reduction in cash used in investing activities is primarily the result of proceeds in the amount of million associated with the sale and exit of the airport to airport business 
payments for property and equipment net of proceeds remained constant at million in compared to million in cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in the decrease is due primarily to our stock offering completed in december of million shares of class a common stock  which generated net proceeds to us of approximately million  compared to in  and cash was used in to repurchase approximately million of stock 
debt effective october   we entered into a million senior secured revolving credit facility and letter of credit sub facility with a group of banks  which replaced the existing million credit facility that was set to mature in march the new facility is secured by revenue equipment and certain other assets and bears interest at the base rate  as defined  plus an applicable margin of to or libor plus an applicable margin of to based on our lease adjusted leverage ratio 
at december   the applicable margin was for base rate loans and for libor loans 
the credit facility also prescribes additional fees for letter of credit transactions and a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment and  respectively  at december  
the facility matures in october the credit facility requires  among other things  maintenance by us of prescribed minimum amounts of consolidated tangible net worth  fixed charge and asset coverage ratios and a leverage ratio 
it also restricts our ability to engage in certain sale leaseback transactions  transactions with affiliates  investment transactions  acquisitions of our own capital stock  the payment of dividends  future asset dispositions except in the ordinary course of business or other business combination transactions and to incur liens and future indebtedness 
as of december   we were in compliance with the revolving credit facility covenants 
we are also party to a million accounts receivable securitization 
under the securitization  we sell accounts receivable as part of a two step process that provides funding similar to a revolving credit facility 
to facilitate this transaction  xpress receivables  llc xpress receivables was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary 
xpress receivables is a bankruptcy remote  special purpose entity  which purchases accounts receivable from us xpress  inc and xpress global systems  inc 
xpress receivables funds these purchases with money borrowed under a credit facility with three pillars funding  llc 
the borrowings are secured by the accounts receivable and paid down through collections on the accounts receivable 
we can borrow up to million under the securitization facility  subject to eligible receivables  and pay interest on borrowings based on commercial paper interest rates  plus an applicable margin  and a commitment fee on the daily  unused portion of the facility 
the securitization facility is reflected as a current liability because the term  subject to annual renewals  runs until october  the securitization facility requires that certain performance ratios be maintained with respect to accounts receivable and that xpress receivables preserve its bankruptcy remote nature 
at december  we had million of borrowings  of which million was long term  million was current maturities and million was the securitization facility 
we also had approximately million in unused letters of credit 
at december  we had an aggregate of approximately million of available borrowing remaining under our revolving credit facility and securitization 
current maturities include thousand in balloon payments related to maturing revenue equipment installment notes 
the balloon payments are generally expected to be funded with proceeds from the sale of the related revenue equipment  which is generally covered by repurchase and or trade agreements in principle between the equipment manufacturer and us 
equity in july  the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million of our class a common stock 
the stock may be repurchased on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at any time until july   at which time  or prior thereto  the board may elect to extend the repurchase program 
we are currently permitted to repurchase approximately million of our class a common stock shares under the board s authorization 
the repurchased shares may be used for issuances under our incentive stock plan or for other general corporate purposes  as the board may determine 
during  we repurchased  shares for approximately million of which  shares for approximately million were purchased under the may board authorization which subsequently expired 
in the first quarter of  we repurchased  shares for approximately million 
in june  the company issued  shares of restricted stock to certain employees 
the market value of these shares on the date of issuance was per share 
this amount is being amortized using the straight line method over the vesting period from the date of issuance as additional compensation expense 
the unamortized value of is included as a component of stockholders equity 
equity investments in january  the company acquired a interest in cw johnson xpress  llc  cw johnson for in cash 
the company provides certain services to cw johnson  including line haul services  owner operator services  and back office support services 
as of december  and december   amounts due to the company for these services were approximately  and  respectively 
we account for cw johnson s operating results using the equity method of accounting 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired of the outstanding stock of ats acquisition holding co 
ats  the parent company of arnold transportation services  inc arnold 
in the second quarter of  we acquired of the outstanding stock of transportation investments inc tii  the parent company of total transportation of mississippi ttms or total transportation  and certain affiliated companies together with tii  the total companies 
certain members of arnold s current management team controlled the remaining interest as well as a majority of the board of directors of ats  and certain members of the ttms management team controlled the remaining interest and a majority of the boards of directors of the total companies 
we did not guarantee any of ats or the total companies debt and did not have any obligation to provide funding  services  or assets 
we accounted for ats and the total companies operating results using the equity method of accounting 
on february   we increased our ownership interest in both ats and the total companies for approximately million in cash 
in the transactions  we increased our holdings to of the outstanding stock of ats and the total companies through the purchase of stock owned by the current management teams of arnold and ttms 
the arnold and ttms management teams continue to hold of the outstanding stock of ats and the total companies  respectively 
in connection with these transactions  ats and the total companies will become parties to and guarantors of our revolving credit facility 
we have guaranteed approximately million of ats and the total companies debt under their respective credit facilities in order to obtain required consents from their lenders to permit ats and the total companies to guarantee our revolving credit facility 
the arnold management team  led by president and chief executive officer mike walters  and the ttms management team  led by co chief executive officers rick kale and john stomps  continue to manage their respective operations and utilize their existing facilities 
in connection with increasing our investments in ats and the total companies  we issued an aggregate of  shares of restricted stock to key employees of those companies under our stock incentive plan 
the restricted shares vest over time contingent upon continued employment 
we expect to record compensation expense in accordance with sfas r in relation to these shares 
commencing march   we will account for ats and the total companies operating results on a consolidated basis 
in the transactions  we also obtained the right to elect a majority of the members of the board of directors of ats 
we retain options to purchase the remaining of each of ats and the total companies through december  and october   respectively 
if we fail to exercise such options prior to such dates  the members of the current arnold and ttms management teams will have similar options to repurchase our interests in ats and the total companies 
off balance sheet arrangements we use non cancelable operating leases as a source of financing for revenue and service equipment  office and terminal facilities  automobiles and airplanes 
in making the decision to finance through long term debt or by entering into non cancelable lease agreements  we consider interest rates  capital requirements and the tax advantages of leasing versus owning 
at december  a substantial portion of our off balance sheet arrangements related to non cancelable leases for revenue equipment and office and terminal facilities with termination dates ranging from september to december lease payments on office and terminal facilities  automobiles and airplanes are included in general and other operating expenses  lease payments on service equipment are included in operating expense and supplies  and lease payments on revenue equipment are included in vehicle rents in the consolidated statements of operations  respectively 
rental expense related to our off balance sheet arrangements was million for the twelve months ended december  the remaining lease obligation as of december  was million  with million due in the next twelve months 
certain equipment leases provide for guarantees by us of a portion of the residual amount under certain circumstances at the end of the lease term 
the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted under these guarantees is approximately million at december  the residual value of a substantial portion of the leased revenue equipment is covered by repurchase or trade agreements in principle between the equipment manufacturer and us 
management estimates the fair value of the guaranteed residual values for leased revenue equipment to be immaterial 
accordingly  we have no guaranteed liabilities accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
cash requirements the following table represents our outstanding contractual obligations at december   excluding letters of credit of million

critical accounting policies and estimates in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
recognition of revenue we generally recognize revenue and direct costs when shipments are completed 
certain revenue of xpress global systems  representing approximately of consolidated revenues at december   is recognized upon manifest  that is  the time when the trailer of the independent carrier is loaded  sealed and ready to leave the dock 
estimated direct expenses are recorded simultaneous with the recognition of revenue 
had revenue been recognized using another method  such as completed shipment  the impact would have been insignificant to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in years in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as state tax credit carry forwards or state net operating loss carry forwards will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined to be not realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations on both a consolidated and separate legal entity basis 
however  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of the realization of the deferred tax assets  we would use our judgment to determine the amount of the valuation allowance required at that time for that period 
the determination of the combined tax rate used to calculate our provision for income taxes for both current and deferred income taxes also requires significant judgment by management 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that the net deferred tax asset or liability be valued using enacted tax rates that we believe will be in effect when these temporary differences reverse 
we use the combined tax rates in effect at the time the financial statements are prepared since no better information is available 
if changes in the federal statutory rate or significant changes in the statutory state and local tax rates occur prior to or during the reversal of these items or if our filing obligations were to change materially  this could change the combined rate and  by extension  our provision for income taxes 
depreciation property and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets net of estimated salvage value or trade in value 
we generally use estimated useful lives of years and years for tractors and trailers  respectively  with estimated salvage values ranging from of the capitalized cost 
the depreciable lives of our revenue equipment represent the estimated usage period of the equipment  which is generally substantially less than the economic lives 
the residual value of a substantial portion our equipment is covered by re purchase or trade agreements between us and the equipment manufacturer 
periodically  we evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long lived assets based upon  but not limited to  its experience with similar assets including gains or losses upon dispositions of such assets  conditions in the used equipment market and prevailing industry practices 
changes in useful lives or salvage value estimates  or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates  could have a material impact on financial results 
further  if our equipment manufacturer does not perform under the terms of the agreements for guaranteed trade in values  such non performance could have a materially negative impact on financial results 
goodwill the excess of the consideration paid us over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill 
effective january   we adopted the provision of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas 
as required by the provisions of sfas  we test goodwill for impairment using a two step process  based on the reporting unit fair value 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures impairment  if any 
we completed the required impairment tests of goodwill and noted no impairment of goodwill in  and goodwill impairment tests are highly subjective 
such tests include estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
as required by sfas no 
 we compared the estimated fair value of the reporting units with their respective carrying amounts including goodwill 
we define a reporting unit as an operating segment 
under sfas no 
 fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit could be bought or sold 
our methods for estimating reporting unit values include asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings  or other financial measures 
each of these methods involve significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future financial performance and the selection of appropriate discount rates and valuation multiples 
claims reserves and estimates claims reserves consist of estimates of cargo loss  physical damage  liability personal injury and property damage  employee medical expenses and workers compensation claims within our established retention levels 
claims in excess of retention levels are generally covered by insurance in amounts we consider adequate 
claims accruals represent the uninsured portion of pending claims including estimates of adverse development of known claims  plus an estimated liability for incurred but not reported claims 
accruals for cargo loss  physical damage  liability and workers compensation claims are estimated based on our evaluation of the type and severity of individual claims and historical information  primarily our own claims experience  along with assumptions about future events combined with the assistance of independent actuaries in the case of workers compensation and liability 
changes in assumptions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near future 
workers compensation and liability claims are particularly subject to a significant degree of uncertainty due to the potential for growth and development of the claims over time 
claims and insurance reserves related to workers compensation and liability are estimated by an independent third party actuary and we refer to these estimates in establishing the reserve 
liability reserves are estimated based on historical experience and trends  the type and severity of individual claims and assumptions about future costs 
further  in establishing the workers compensation and liability reserves  we must take into account and estimate various factors  including  but not limited to  assumptions concerning the nature and severity of the claim  the effect of the jurisdiction on any award or settlement  the length of time until ultimate resolution  inflation rates in health care and in general  interest rates  legal expenses and other factors 
our actual experience may be different than our estimates  sometimes significantly 
additionally  changes in assumptions made in actuarial studies could potentially have a material effect on the provision for workers compensation and liability claims 
we have experienced significant increases in insurance premiums and claims expense since september primarily related to workers compensation and liability insurance 
the increases have resulted from a significant increase in excess insurance premiums  adverse development in prior year losses  unfavorable accident experience and an increase in retention levels related to liability and workers compensation claims 
the retention level for liability insurance was thousand prior to september and has increased to ranges of thousand to million in subsequent periods 
prior to november  we had no retention for workers compensation insurance  which has increased to ranges of thousand to thousand in subsequent periods 
our insurance and claims expense varies based on the frequency and severity of claims  the premium expense and the level of self insured retention 
the increase in self insurance retention levels since november and september has caused insurance and claims expense to be higher and more volatile than in historical periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board  fasb  issued fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas  supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
the provisions of the statement were to be applied in the first interim or annual period beginning after june  on april   the securities and exchange commission announced that it would provide for phased in implementation of sfas r 
in accordance with this new implementation process  the company will adopt sfas r on january  as permitted by sfas  the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using opinion s intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas r s fair value method will have a significant impact on our results of operations  although it will have no impact on our overall financial position 
the impact of adoption of sfas r cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to our consolidated financial statements 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
while the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options  the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were not material to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued an exposure draft  accounting for uncertain tax positions an interpretation of fasb statement no 
if finalized as drafted  the interpretation will require companies to recognize the best estimate of the impact of a tax position only if that position is probable of being sustained during a tax audit 
the fasb proposed that only tax positions that meet the probable recognition threshold may be recognized as of the end of the first fiscal year ending after december  upon redeliberation by the fasb at its january  meeting  it was decided that the final interpretation  which the fasb expects to issue in the first quarter of  will be effective as of the beginning of the first annual period beginning after december  management is currently evaluating the exposure draft and does not anticipate that it will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosure about market risk we experience various market risks  including changes in interest rates and fuel prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes or when there are no underlying related exposures 
interest rate risk our market risk is affected by changes in interest rates 
historically  we have used a combination of fixed rate and variable rate obligations to manage our interest rate exposure 
fixed rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might fall 
variable rate obligations expose us to the risk that interest rates might rise 
we did not have any interest rate swaps at december   although we may enter into such swaps in the future 
we are exposed to variable interest rate risk principally from our securitization facility and revolving credit facility 
we are exposed to fixed interest rate risk principally from equipment notes and mortgages 
at december  we had borrowings totaling million comprised of million of variable rate borrowings and million of fixed rate borrowings 
holding other variables constant such as borrowing levels  the earnings impact of a one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our statements of operations 
commodity price risk fuel is one of our largest expenditures 
the price and availability of diesel fuel fluctuates due to changes in production  seasonality and other market factors generally outside our control 
many of our customer contracts contain fuel surcharge provisions to mitigate increases in the cost of fuel 
fuel surcharges to customers do not fully recover all of fuel increases due to engine idle time and out of route and empty miles not billable to the customer
