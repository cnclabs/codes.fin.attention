industry market growth for our products is primarily driven by favorable demographics 
although we believe the number of surgical procedures performed were lower than anticipated in the second half of  we believe the longer term demographic trends will be continued growth in surgical procedures as a result of the aging of the population  and technological advancements  which result in safer and less invasive surgical procedures 
additionally  as people are living longer  more active lives  they are engaging in contact sports and activities such as running  skiing  rollerblading  golf and tennis which result in injuries with greater frequency and at an earlier age than ever before 
sales of surgical products aggregated approximately of our total net revenues in see products 
continued pressure to reduce health care costs 
in response to rising health care costs  managed care companies and other third party payers have placed pressures on health care providers to reduce costs 
as a result  health care providers have focused on the high cost areas such as surgery 
to reduce costs  health care providers use minimally invasive techniques  which generally reduce patient trauma  recovery time and ultimately the length of hospitalization 
approximately of our products are designed for use in minimally invasive surgical procedures 
see products 
health care providers are also increasingly purchasing single use  disposable products  which reduce the costs associated with sterilizing surgical instruments and products following surgery 
the single use nature of disposable products lowers the risk of incorrectly sterilized instruments spreading infection into the patient and increasing the cost of post operative care 
approximately of our sales are derived from single use disposable products 
in the united states  the pressure on health care providers to contain costs has caused many health care providers to enter into comprehensive purchasing contracts with fewer suppliers  which offer a broader array of products at lower prices 
in addition  many health care providers have aligned themselves with group purchasing organizations gpos or integrated health networks ihns  whose stated purpose is to aggregate the purchasing volume of their members in order to negotiate competitive pricing with suppliers  including manufacturers of surgical products 
we believe that these trends will favor entities which offer a diverse product portfolio

this surgical specialty results in less trauma for the patient and produces important cost savings as a result of shorter recovery times and reduced hospitalization 
endoscopic surgery is performed on organs in the abdominal cavity such as the gallbladder  appendix and female reproductive organs 
during such procedures  devices called trocars are used to puncture the abdominal wall and are then removed  leaving in place a trocar cannula 
the trocar cannula provides access into the abdomen for camera systems and surgical instruments 
some of our endosurgical instruments are reposable  meaning that the instrument has a disposable and a reusable component 
our endosurgical products include the reflex and permaclip clip appliers for vessel and duct ligation  universal s i suction irrigation and universal plus laparoscopic instruments  specialized suction irrigation electrosurgical instrument systems for use in laparoscopic surgery and the trogard finesse which incorporates a blunt tipped version of a trocar 
the trogard finesse dilates access through the body wall rather than cutting with the sharp  pointed tips of conventional trocars thus resulting in smaller wounds  and less bleeding 
we also offer cutting trocars  suction irrigation accessories  laparoscopic scissors  active electrodes  insufflation needles and linear cutters and staplers for use in laparoscopic surgery

we are not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for more than of our net sales in  and a significant portion of our us sales are to customers affiliated with gpos  ihns and other large national or regional accounts  as well as to the veterans administration and other hospitals operated by the federal government 
for hospital inventory management purposes  some of our customers prefer to purchase our products through independent third party medical product distributors 
in order to provide a high level of expertise to the medical specialties we serve  our domestic sales force consists of the following sales representatives selling arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument products employed by independent sales agent groups  employee sales representatives selling electrosurgery products  employee sales representatives selling endosurgery products  employee sales representatives selling patient care products  employee sales representatives selling endoscopic technologies products 
each employee sales representative is assigned a defined geographic area and compensated on a commission basis or through a combination of salary and commission 
the sales force is supervised and supported by either area directors or district managers 
sales agent groups are used in the united states to sell our arthroscopy  multi specialty medical video systems and powered surgical instrument products 
these sales agent groups are paid a commission for sales made to customers while home office sales and marketing management provide the overall direction for sales of our products 
our corporate sales organization is responsible for interacting with large regional and national accounts eg 
gpos  ihns  idns  etc we have contracts with many such organizations and believe that  with certain exceptions  the lack of any individual group purchasing contract will not adversely impact our competitiveness in the marketplace 
in addition  all of our sales professionals are required to work closely with distributors where applicable and maintain close relationships with end users 
the sale of our products is accompanied by initial and ongoing in service end user training 
each of our dedicated sales professionals are highly knowledgeable in the applications and procedures for the products they sell 
our sales professionals  in turn  provide surgeons and medical personnel with information relating to the technical features and benefits of our products 
maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our long term growth plan 
our products are sold in over foreign countries 
international sales efforts are coordinated through local country dealers or through direct in country sales 
we distribute our products through sales subsidiaries and branches with offices located in australia  austria  belgium  canada  france  germany  korea  the netherlands  spain  poland and the united kingdom 
in these countries  our sales are denominated in the local currency 
in the remaining countries where our products are sold through independent distributors  sales are denominated in united states dollars 
we sell to a diversified base of customers around the world and  therefore  believe there is no material concentration of credit risk 
manufacturing we manufacture substantially all of our products and assemble them from components we produce 
our strategy has historically been to vertically integrate our manufacturing facilities in order to develop competitive advantage 
this integration provides us with cost efficient and flexible manufacturing operations which permit us to allocate capital more efficiently 
additionally  we attempt to exploit commercial synergies between operations  such as the procurement of common raw materials and components used in production 
raw material costs constitute a substantial portion of our cost of production 
we use numerous raw materials and components in the design  development and manufacturing of our products 
substantially all of our raw materials and select components used in the manufacturing process are procured from external suppliers 
we work closely with multiple suppliers to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability 
none of our critical raw materials and components are procured from single sources for reasons of quality assurance  sole source availability  cost effectiveness or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements 
the loss of any existing supplier or supplier contract would not have a material adverse effect on our financial and operational performance 
to date  we have not experienced any protracted interruption in the availability of raw materials and components necessary to fulfill production schedules 
all of our products are classified as medical devices subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies  including the united states food and drug administration fda and comparable foreign counter parts 
the fda s quality system regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes  require the maintenance of certain records and provide for on site inspections of our facilities by the fda 
in many of the foreign countries in which we manufacture and distribute our products we are subject to regulatory requirements affecting  among other things  product performance standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements and import laws 
regulatory requirements affecting the company vary from country to country 
the timeframes and costs for regulatory submission and approval from foreign agencies or legislative bodies may vary from those required by the fda 
certain requirements for approval from foreign agencies or legislative bodies may also differ from those of the fda 
we believe that our production and inventory management practices are characteristic of those in the medical device industry 
substantially all of our products are stocked in inventory and are not manufactured to order or to individual customer specifications 
we schedule production and maintain adequate levels of safety stock based on a number of factors including  experience  knowledge of customer ordering patterns  demand  manufacturing lead times and optimal quantities required to maintain the highest possible service levels 
customer orders are generally processed for immediate shipment and backlog of firm orders is therefore not considered material to an understanding of our business 
research and development new and improved products play a critical role in our continued sales growth 
internal research and development efforts focus on the development of new products and product technological and design improvements aimed at complementing and expanding existing product lines 
we continually seek to leverage new technologies which improve the durability  performance and usability of existing products 
in addition  we maintain close working relationships with surgeons  inventors and operating room personnel who often make new product and technology disclosures  principally in procedure specific areas 
for clinical and commercially promising disclosures  we seek to obtain rights to these ideas through negotiated agreements 
such agreements typically compensate the originator through royalty payments based upon a percentage of licensed product net sales 
royalty expense approximated million  million and million in  and  respectively 
amounts expended for company sponsored research and development was approximately million  million and million during   and  respectively 
we have rights to significant intellectual property  including united states patents and foreign equivalent patents which cover a wide range of our products 
we own a majority of these patents and have exclusive and non exclusive licensing rights to the remainder 
in addition  certain of these patents have currently been licensed to third parties on a non exclusive basis 
we believe that the development of new products and technological and design improvements to existing products will continue to be of primary importance in maintaining our competitive position 
competition the market for our products is highly competitive and our customers generally have numerous alternatives of supply 
many of our competitors offer a range of products in areas other than those in which we compete  which may make such competitors more attractive to surgeons  hospitals  group purchasing organizations and others 
in addition  several of our competitors are large  technically competent firms with substantial assets

in the future  other alternatives such as new medical procedures or pharmaceuticals may become interchangeable alternatives to our products 
government regulation and quality systems substantially all of our products are classified as medical devices subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies  including the fda and comparable foreign counter parts 
authorization to commercially distribute our products in the us is granted by the fda under a procedure referred to as k premarket notification 
this process requires us to demonstrate that our new product  line extension or modified product is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device which was on the market prior to may  or is currently on the us market and does not require premarket approval 
substantially all of our products have been classified as either class i or class ii devices with the fda  indicating that they are subject to the k premarketing notification clearance as discussed above and must continually meet certain fda standards our products are classified as class i  iia and iib in the european union eu and subject to regulation by our european notified body 
our fda clearance is subject to continual review and future discovery of previously unknown events could result in restrictions being placed on a product s marketing or notification from the fda to halt the distribution of certain medical devices 
medical device regulations continue to evolve world wide 
products marketed in the eu and other countries require preparation of technical files and dossiers which demonstrate compliance with applicable local regulations 
products marketed in australia are subject to a new classification system and must be re registered under the updated therapuetics goods act s by october in order to continue distribution 
products marketed in japan must be re registered under the ministry of health s  recently updated pharmacuetical affairs law pal 
as government regulations continue to change  there is a risk that the distribution of some of our products may be interrupted or discontinued if they do not meet the new requirements 
our operations are supported by quality assurance regulatory compliance personnel tasked with monitoring compliance to design controls  process controls and the other relevant government regulations for all of our design  manufacturing  distribution and servicing activities 
we and substantially all of our products are subject to the provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act of  as amended by the medical device amendments of  safe medical device act of  medical device modernization act of  medical user fee and modernization act of and similar international regulations  such as the european union medical device directives 
as a manufacturer of medical devices  the fda s quality system regulations as specified in title  code of federal regulation cfr part  set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes  require the maintenance of certain records  provide for on site inspection of our facilities and continuing review by the fda 
many of our products are also subject to industry defined standards 
such industry defined product standards are generally formulated by committees of the association for the advancement of medical instrumentation aami  international electrotechnical commission iec and the international organization for standardization iso 
we believe that our products and processes presently meet applicable standards in all material respects 
as noted above  our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda for  among other things  conformance to quality system regulation and current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements 
following an inspection  the fda typically provides its observations  if any  in the form of a form notice of inspectional observations with specific observations concerning potential violation of regulations 
in december  the fda initiated an inspection of our largo  florida manufacturing facility 
following the inspection  the fda issued to us a form notice which included observations related to our corrective and preventive action procedures for nonconforming products and other quality problems 
although we responded to the form to address and correct the deficiencies  the fda further issued a warning letter in june relating to these observations 
we subsequently responded to the fda with a plan of the corrective actions that we have taken or proposed to take 
in that response  we committed to further developing and implementing  in a timely manner  the principles and strategies of systems based quality management for improved cgmp compliance  operational performance and efficiencies 
management considers the receipt of a warning letter to be an important regulatory event 
accordingly  we are undertaking corrective actions that may involve additional costs for the company  and these costs may be material 
further  there can be no assurance that the actions undertaken by the company will ensure that the company will not undertake recalls  voluntary or otherwise  nor can there be any assurance that a future inspection by fda will not result in an additional form or warning letter  or other regulatory actions which may include consent decrees or fines 
we market our products in several foreign countries and therefore are subject to regulations affecting  among other things  product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements and import laws 
many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the fda 
the member countries of the european union have adopted the european medical device directives  which create a single set of medical device regulations for all member countries 
these regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in the european union maintain quality system certification through european union recognized notified bodies 
these notified bodies authorize the use of the ce mark allowing free movement of our products throughout the member countries 
requirements pertaining to our products vary widely from country to country  ranging from simple product registrations to detailed submissions such as those required by the fda 
we believe that our products currently meet applicable standards for the countries in which they are marketed 
our products may become subject to recall or market withdrawal regulations and we have made product recalls in the past 
no product recall has had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations  however there can be no assurance that regulatory issues will not have a material adverse effect in the future 
any change in existing federal  state  foreign laws or regulations  or in the interpretation or enforcement thereof  or the promulgation or any additional laws or regulations may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
employees as of december   we had approximately  full time employees  including more than  in operations  in research and development  and the remaining in sales  marketing and related administrative support 
we believe that we have good relations with our employees and have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
item a 
risk factors an investment in our securities  including our common stock  involves a high degree of risk 
investors should carefully consider the specific factors set forth below as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form k 
see forward looking statements 
our financial performance is subject to the risks inherent in our acquisition strategy  including the effects of increased borrowing and integration of newly acquired businesses or product lines 
a key element of our business strategy has been to expand through acquisitions and we may seek to pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
our success is dependent in part upon our ability to integrate acquired companies or product lines into our existing operations 
we may not have sufficient management and other resources to accomplish the integration of our past and future acquisitions and implementing our acquisition strategy may strain our relationship with customers  suppliers  distributors  manufacturing personnel or others 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and make acquisitions on acceptable terms or that we will be able to obtain financing for such acquisitions on acceptable terms 
in addition  while we are generally entitled to customary indemnification from sellers of businesses for any difficulties that may have arisen prior to our acquisition of each business  acquisitions may involve exposure to unknown liabilities and the amount and time for claiming under these indemnification provisions is often limited 
as a result  our financial performance is now and will continue to be subject to various risks associated with the acquisition of businesses  including the financial effects associated with any increased borrowing required to fund such acquisitions or with the integration of such businesses 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in recalls  fines or materially adverse implications 
all of our products are classified as medical devices subject to regulation by the fda 
as a manufacturer of medical devices  our manufacturing processes and facilities are subject to on site inspection and continuing review by the fda for compliance with the quality system regulations 
manufacturing and sales of our products outside the united states are also subject to foreign regulatory requirements which vary from country to country 
moreover  we are generally required to obtain regulatory clearance or approval prior to marketing a new product 
the time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval  and requirements for foreign approvals may differ from fda requirements 
failure to comply with applicable domestic and or foreign regulatory requirements may result in fines or other enforcement actions  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawal of existing product approvals or clearances  refusal to approve or clear new applications or notices  increased quality control costs  or criminal prosecution 
failure to comply with quality system regulations and applicable foreign regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are not able to manufacture products in compliance with regulatory standards  we may decide to cease manufacturing of those products and may be subject to product recall 
in addition to the quality system regulations  many of our products are also subject to industry defined standards 
we may not be able to comply with these regulations and standards due to deficiencies in component parts or our manufacturing processes 
if we are not able to comply with the quality system regulations or industry defined standards  we may not be able to fill customer orders and we may decide to cease production of non compliant products 
failure to produce products could affect our profit margins and could lead to loss of customers 
our products are subject to product recall and we have made product recalls in the past 
although no recall has had a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  we cannot assure you that regulatory issues will not have a material adverse effect in the future or that product recalls will not harm our reputation and our customer relationships 
the highly competitive market for our products may create adverse pricing pressures 
the market for our products is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives of supply 
many of our competitors offer a range of products in areas other than those in which we compete  which may make such competitors more attractive to surgeons  hospitals  group purchasing organizations and others 
in addition  several of our competitors are large  technically competent firms with substantial assets 
competitive pricing pressures or the introduction of new products by our competitors could have an adverse effect on our revenues 
see competition for a further discussion of these competitive forces 
factors which may influence our customers choice of competitor products include changes in surgeon preferences  increases or decreases in health care spending related to medical devices  our inability to supply products to them  as a result of product recall  market withdrawal or back order  the introduction by competitors of new products or new features to existing products  the introduction by competitors of alternative surgical technology  and advances in surgical procedures  discoveries or developments in the health care industry 
we use a variety of raw materials in our businesses  and significant shortages or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products 
our reliance on certain suppliers and commodity markets to secure raw materials used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of raw materials 
in some instances  we participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations by suppliers 
a disruption in deliveries from our suppliers  price increases  or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities  could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs 
we believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices 
nonetheless  price increases or the unavailability of some raw materials may have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
cost reduction efforts in the health care industry could put pressures on our prices and margins 
in recent years  the health care industry has undergone significant change driven by various efforts to reduce costs 
such efforts include national health care reform  trends towards managed care  cuts in medicare  consolidation of health care distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by gpos and ihns 
demand and prices for our products may be adversely affected by such trends 
we may not be able to keep pace with technological change or to successfully develop new products with wide market acceptance  which could cause us to lose business to competitors 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology 
our future financial performance will depend in part on our ability to develop and manufacture new products on a cost effective basis  to introduce them to the market on a timely basis  and to have them accepted by surgeons 
we may not be able to keep pace with technology or to develop viable new products 
factors which may result in delays of new product introductions or cancellation of our plans to manufacture and market new products include capital constraints  research and development delays  delays in securing regulatory approvals  or changes in the competitive landscape  including the emergence of alternative products or solutions which reduce or eliminate the markets for pending products 
our new products may fail to achieve expected levels of market acceptance 
new product introductions may fail to achieve market acceptance 
the degree of market acceptance for any of our products will depend upon a number of factors  including our ability to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in the time frames we currently estimate  our ability to successfully implement new technologies  the market s readiness to accept new products  having adequate financial and technological resources for future product development and promotion  the efficacy of our products  and the prices of our products compared to the prices of our competitors products 
if our new products do not achieve market acceptance  we may be unable to recover our investments and may lose business to competitors 
in addition  some of the companies with which we now compete or may compete in the future have or may have more extensive research  marketing and manufacturing capabilities and significantly greater technical and personnel resources than we do  and may be better positioned to continue to improve their technology in order to compete in an evolving industry 
see competition for a further discussion of these competitive forces 
our senior credit agreement contains covenants which may limit our flexibility or prevent us from taking actions 
our senior credit agreement contains  and future credit facilities are expected to contain  certain restrictive covenants which will affect  and in many respects significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  pay dividends or make other distributions on  or redeem or repurchase  capital stock  sell assets  and pursue acquisitions 
these covenants  unless waived  may prevent us from pursuing acquisitions  significantly limit our operating and financial flexibility and limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities 
our ability to comply with such provisions may be affected by events beyond our control 
in the event of any default under our credit agreement  the credit agreement lenders may elect to declare all amounts borrowed under our credit agreement  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable 
if we were unable to repay such borrowings  the credit agreement lenders could proceed against collateral securing the credit agreement  which consists of substantially all of our property and assets  except for our accounts receivable and related rights which are sold in connection with the accounts receivable sales agreement 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of the accounts receivable sales agreement 
our credit agreement also contains a material adverse effect clause which may limit our ability to access additional funding under our credit agreement should a material adverse change in our business occur 
our substantial leverage and debt service requirements may require us to adopt alternative business strategies 
we have indebtedness that is substantial in relation to our shareholders equity  as well as interest and debt service requirements that are significant compared to our cash flow from operations 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding  representing of total capitalization and which does not include the million of accounts receivable sold under the accounts receivable sales agreement 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to investors  including but not limited to the following a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for operations  capital expenditures  acquisitions  dividends and other purposes  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be limited or impaired  or may be at higher interest rates  we may be at a competitive disadvantage when compared to competitors that are less leveraged  we may be hindered in our ability to adjust rapidly to market conditions  our degree of leverage could make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in general economic conditions or other adverse circumstances applicable to us  and our interest expense could increase if interest rates in general increase because a portion of our borrowings  including our borrowings under our credit agreement  are and will continue to be at variable rates of interest 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness  which could require us to reduce our expenditures  sell assets  restructure our indebtedness or seek additional equity capital 
our ability to satisfy our obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we may not have sufficient cash flow available to enable us to meet our obligations 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness  we will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include actions such as foregoing acquisitions  reducing or delaying capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital 
we cannot assure you that any of these strategies could be implemented on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our indebtedness and its implications 
we may be unable to continue to sell our accounts receivable  which could require us to seek alternative sources of financing 
under our accounts receivable sales agreement  there are certain statistical ratios which must be maintained relating to the pool of receivables in order for us to continue selling to the purchaser 
these ratios relate to sales dilution and losses on accounts receivable 
if new accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business do not qualify for sale or the purchaser otherwise ceases to purchase our receivables  we may require access to alternate sources of working capital  which may be more expensive or difficult to obtain 
our accounts receivable sales agreement  as amended  also requires us to obtain a commitment the purchaser commitment  on an annual basis from the purchaser to fund the purchase of our accounts receivable 
the purchaser commitment was amended effective october  whereby it was extended for an additional year 
in the event we are unable to renew our purchaser commitment in the future  we would need to access alternate sources of working capital which may be more expensive or difficult to obtain 
if we infringe third parties patents  or if we lose our patents or they are held to be invalid  we could become subject to liability and our competitive position could be harmed 
much of the technology used in the markets in which we compete is covered by patents 
we have numerous us patents and corresponding foreign patents on products expiring at various dates from through and have additional patent applications pending 
see research and development for a further description of our patents 
the loss of our patents could reduce the value of the related products and any related competitive advantage 
competitors may also be able to design around our patents and to compete effectively with our products 
in addition  the cost of enforcing our patents against third parties and defending our products against patent infringement actions by others could be substantial 
we cannot assure you that pending patent applications will result in issued patents  patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged by competitors  our patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or provide us with a competitive advantage  or we will be successful in defending against pending or future patent infringement claims asserted against our products 
ordering patterns of our customers may change resulting in reductions in sales 
our hospital and surgery center customers purchase our products in quantities sufficient to meet their anticipated demand 
likewise  our health care distributor customers purchase our products for ultimate resale to health care providers in quantities sufficient to meet the anticipated requirements of the distributors customers 
should inventories of our products owned by our hospital  surgery center and distributor customers grow to levels higher than their requirements  our customers may reduce the ordering of products from us 
this could result in reduced sales during a financial accounting period 
our significant international operations subject us to risks associated with operating in foreign countries 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from foreign sales 
as a result  our international presence exposes us to certain inherent risks  including devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates  imposition of limitations on conversions of foreign currencies into dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by international subsidiaries  imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by international subsidiaries  trade barriers  political risks  including political instability  reliance on third parties to distribute our products  hyperinflation in certain foreign countries  and imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments 
we cannot assure you that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we can be sued for producing defective products and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover the nature and amount of any product liability claims 
the nature of our products as medical devices and today s litigious environment should be regarded as potential risks which could significantly and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the insurance we maintain to protect against claims associated with the use of our products have deductibles and may not adequately cover the amount or nature of any claim asserted against us 
we are also exposed to the risk that our insurers may become insolvent or that premiums may increase substantially 
see legal proceedings for a further discussion of the risk of product liability actions and our insurance coverage 
damage to our physical properties as a result of windstorm  earthquake  fire or other natural or man made disaster may cause a financial loss and a loss of customers 
although we maintain insurance coverage for physical damage to our property and the resultant losses that could occur during a business interruption  we are required to pay deductibles and our insurance coverage is limited to certain caps 
for example  our deductible for windstorm damage to our florida property amounts to of any loss and coverage for earthquake damage to our california properties is limited to million 
further  while insurance reimburses us for our lost gross earnings during a business interruption  if we are unable to supply our customers with our products for an extended period of time  there can be no assurance that we will regain the customers business once the product supply is returned to normal 
item properties facilities the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our principal operating facilities 
we believe that our facilities are generally well maintained  are suitable to support our business and adequate for present and anticipated needs

likewise  from time to time  the company may receive a subpoena from a government agency such as the equal employment opportunity commission  occupational safety and health administration  the department of labor  the treasury department  and other federal and state agencies 
these subpoenae may or may not be routine inquiries 
these claims are generally covered by various insurance policies  subject to certain deductible amounts and maximum policy limits 
when there is no insurance coverage  as would typically be the case primarily in lawsuits alleging patent infringement or in connection with certain government investigations  we establish sufficient reserves to cover probable losses associated with such claims 
we do not expect that the resolution of any pending claims or investigations will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that future claims or investigations  the costs associated with claims or investigations  especially claims and investigations not covered by insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our future performance 
manufacturers of medical products may face exposure to significant product liability claims 
to date  we have not experienced any material product liability claims  but any such claims arising in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we currently maintain commercial product liability insurance of million per incident and million in the aggregate annually  which we believe is adequate 
this coverage is on a claims made basis 
there can be no assurance that claims will not exceed insurance coverage or that such insurance will be available in the future at a reasonable cost to us 
our operations are subject  and in the past have been subject  to a number of environmental laws and regulations governing  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges  the use  handling and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  soil and groundwater remediation and employee health and safety 
in some jurisdictions environmental requirements may be expected to become more stringent in the future 
in the united states certain environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of site restoration upon each of the parties that may have contributed to conditions at the site regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the party s activities 
while we do not believe that the present costs of environmental compliance and remediation are material  there can be no assurance that future compliance or remedial obligations could not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
as discussed in note  we entered into a settlement of certain environmental claims during the second quarter of related to the operations of one of our subsidiaries during the s  before it was acquired by conmed  at a site other than the one it currently occupies 
in november  we commenced litigation against johnson johnson and several of its subsidiaries  including ethicon  inc for violation of federal and state antitrust laws 
the lawsuit claims that johnson johnson engaged in illegal and anticompetitive conduct with respect to sales of product used in endoscopic surgery  resulting in higher prices to consumers and the exclusion of competition 
we have sought relief which includes an injunction restraining johnson johnson from continuing its anticompetitive practice as well as receiving the maximum amount of damages allowed by law 
the discovery phase is now essentially completed 
johnson johnson filed a motion for summary judgment on october  if granted  the motion would end the case  subject to an appeal that we would be entitled to take 
our response to the motion was submitted in november  and the hearing on the motion was held on december  there is no fixed time frame within which the court must decide the motion 
while we believe that our claims are well grounded in fact and law  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our claim 
in addition  the costs associated with pursuing this claim may be material

overview of conmed corporation conmed corporation conmed  the company  we or us is a medical technology company with an emphasis on surgical devices and equipment for minimally invasive procedures and monitoring 
the company s products serve the clinical areas of arthroscopy  powered surgical instruments  electrosurgery  cardiac monitoring disposables  endosurgery and endoscopic technologies 
they are used by surgeons and physicians in a variety of specialties including orthopedics  general surgery  gynecology  neurosurgery  and gastroenterology 
these product lines and the percentage of consolidated revenues associated with each  are as follows arthroscopy powered surgical instruments electrosurgery patient care endosurgery endoscopic technologies consolidated net sales a significant amount of our products are used in surgical procedures with approximately of our revenues derived from the sale of disposable products 
our capital equipment offerings also facilitate the ongoing sale of related disposable products and accessories  thus providing us with a recurring revenue stream 
we manufacture substantially all of our products in facilities located in the united states  mexico and finland 
we market our products both domestically and internationally directly to customers and through distributors 
international sales approximated  and in  and  respectively 
business environment and opportunities the aging of the worldwide population along with lifestyle changes  continued cost containment pressures on healthcare systems and the desire of clinicians and administrators to use less invasive or noninvasive procedures are important trends which are driving the growth in our industry 
we believe that with our broad product offering of high quality surgical and patient care products  we can capitalize on this growth for the benefit of the company and our shareholders 
in order to further our growth prospects  we have historically used strategic business acquisitions and exclusive distribution relationships  including the following  to continue to diversify our product offerings  increase our market share and realize economies of scale 
in march we made important progress in broadening our offering of bioabsorbable implants within our arthroscopy product line with the acquisition of bionx implants  inc the bionx acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in january we expanded our patient care offerings through an agreement with dolphin medical  inc  a subsidiary of osi systems  inc  under which we became the exclusive north american distributor for a full line of dolphin pulse oximetry products 
in september  we added an entirely new product line with the acquisition of certain assets of the endoscopic technologies division of cr bard  inc the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the endoscopic technologies product line consists of various disposable products used by gastroenterologists to diagnose and treat diseases of the digestive tract 
these products also complement our existing electrosurgery product offerings 
we have a variety of research and development initiatives focused in each of our principal product lines 
among the most significant of these efforts is the endotracheal cardiac output monitor ecom 
our ecom product offering is expected to replace catheter monitoring of cardiac output with a specially designed endotracheal tube which utilizes proprietary bio impedance technology 
also of significance are our research and development efforts in the area of tissue sealing for electrosurgery and high definition minimally invasive surgery camera systems for arthroscopy 
continued innovation and commercialization of new proprietary products and processes are essential elements of our long term growth strategy 
in march  we plan to unveil several new products at the american academy of orthopedic surgeons annual meeting which will enhance our arthroscopy and powered instrument product offerings 
additionally  we recently introduced our pro product which permits non invasive analysis of blood oxygen levels in clinical situations which previously could not be accomplished using traditional non invasive techniques 
business challenges during the second half of we experienced lower than expected sales  as a result  we believe  of lower than anticipated surgical procedures 
in addition  we experienced significant cost increases with respect to petroleum based raw materials such as plastic resins and polymers used in the production of many of our products  particularly our disposable products  as a result of the increased cost of oil following hurricane katrina 
we also experienced significant increases in in bound and out bound freight costs 
during  we believe the number of surgical procedures will return to more normal levels resulting in increased sales of our products 
in addition  we plan to implement limited price increases to offset the manufacturing cost increases as a result of the increases in the price of oil 
our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the united states food and drug administration fda for  among other things  conformance to quality system regulation and current good manufacturing practice cgmp requirements 
following an inspection  the fda typically provides its observations  if any  in the form of a form notice of inspectional observations with specific observations concerning potential violation of regulations 
in december  the fda initiated an inspection of our largo  florida manufacturing facility 
following the inspection  the fda issued to us a form notice which included observations related to our corrective and preventative action procedures for nonconforming products and other quality problems 
although we responded to the form to address and correct the deficiencies  the fda further issued a warning letter in june relating to these observations 
we subsequently responded to the fda with a plan of the corrective actions that we have taken or proposed to take 
in that response  we committed to further developing and implementing  in a timely manner  the principles and strategies of a company wide systems based quality management for improved cgmp compliance  operational performance and efficiencies 
we consider the receipt of a warning letter to be an important regulatory event 
accordingly  we are undertaking corrective actions that we believe will involve significant additional costs for the company 
however  even with our efforts to implement a company wide quality systems initiative  there can be no assurance that the actions undertaken by the company will ensure that we will not receive an additional form or warning letter  or other regulatory actions which may include consent decrees or fines 
we remain in litigation against johnson johnson and several of its subsidiaries  including ethicon  inc for violation of federal and state antitrust laws 
the lawsuit claims that johnson johnson engaged in illegal and anticompetitive conduct with respect to sales of product used in endoscopic surgery  resulting in higher prices to consumers and the exclusion of competition 
we have sought relief which includes an injunction restraining johnson johnson from continuing its anticompetitive practice as well as receiving the maximum amount of damages allowed by law 
while we believe that our claims are well grounded in fact and law  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our claim 
in addition  the costs associated with pursuing this claim have been substantial 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below and are considered by management to be critical to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of conmed corporation 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title has been transferred to the customer which is at the time of shipment 
the following policies apply to our major categories of revenue transactions sales to customers are evidenced by firm purchase orders 
title and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer when product is shipped under our stated shipping terms 
payment by the customer is due under fixed payment terms 
we place certain of our capital equipment with customers in return for commitments to purchase disposable products over time periods generally ranging from one to three years 
in these circumstances  no revenue is recognized upon capital equipment shipment and we recognize revenue upon the disposable product shipment 
the cost of the equipment is amortized over the term of individual commitment agreements 
product returns are only accepted at the discretion of the company and in accordance with our returned goods policy 
historically the level of product returns has not been significant 
we accrue for sales returns  rebates and allowances based upon an analysis of historical customer returns and credits  rebates  discounts and current market conditions 
our terms of sale to customers generally do not include any obligations to perform future services 
limited warranties are provided for capital equipment sales and provisions for warranty are provided at the time of product sale based upon an analysis of historical data 
amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling have been included in net sales 
shipping and handling costs included in selling and administrative expense were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we sell to a diversified base of customers around the world and  therefore  believe there is no material concentration of credit risk 
we assess the risk of loss on accounts receivable and adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this risk assessment 
historically  losses on accounts receivable have not been material 
management believes that the allowance for doubtful accounts of million at december  is adequate to provide for probable losses resulting from accounts receivable 
inventory reserves we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the inability to sell our products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an on going basis 
such marketplace changes may result in our products becoming obsolete 
we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of our products and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we believe that our current inventory reserves are adequate 
business acquisitions we have a history of growth through acquisitions 
assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the purchase method of accounting at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
other intangible assets primarily represent allocations of purchase price to identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
we have accumulated goodwill of million and other intangible assets of million as of december  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to at least annual impairment testing 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our business 
estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques 
future cash flows may be affected by changes in industry or market conditions or the rate and extent to which anticipated synergies or cost savings are realized with newly acquired entities 
intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
intangible assets which continue to be subject to amortization are also evaluated to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
an intangible asset is determined to be impaired when estimated undiscounted future cash flows indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized by reducing the recorded value to its current fair value 
although no goodwill or other intangible asset impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurance that future impairment will not occur 
it is our policy to perform annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on recent acquisitions 
pension plan we sponsor a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all our employees 
overall benefit levels provided under the plan were reduced effective january  resulting in an immediate reduction in the projected benefit obligation of approximately million 
major assumptions used in accounting for the plan include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of increase in employee compensation levels and expected mortality 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated annually as of the plan s measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
lower market interest rates have resulted in us lowering the discount rate used in determining pension expense from in to in this change in assumption will result in higher pension expense during this rate was determined by using the citigroup pension liability index rate which  we believe  is a reasonable indicator of our plan s future payment stream 
we have used an expected rate of return on pension plan assets of for purposes of determining the net periodic pension benefit cost 
in determining the expected return on pension plan assets  we consider the relative weighting of plan assets  the historical performance of total plan assets and individual asset classes and economic and other indicators of future performance 
in addition  we consult with financial and investment management professionals in developing appropriate targeted rates of return 
we have estimated our rate of increase in employee compensation levels at consistent with our internal budgeting 
as of december   we changed from the unisex pension mortality table to the group annuity reserving mortality table for purposes of determining expected mortality 
this change in assumption resulted in higher pension expense in based on these and other factors  pension expense is estimated at approximately million as compared to million in actual expense may vary significantly from this estimate 
we do not expect there to be any required contributions to our pension plan in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes the recorded future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards is approximately million at december  management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits 
we have established a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of certain net operating loss carryforwards recognized in connection with the bionx acquisition 
any subsequently recognized tax benefits associated with the valuation allowance would be allocated to reduce goodwill 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels

endoscopic technologies sales increased million in to million from million in  as a result of the inclusion of a full year of sales in related to the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition 
cost of sales increased to million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of increased sales volumes in each of our principal product lines as described above 
gross profit margins decreased percentage points from in to in primarily as a result of significant cost increases with respect to petroleum based raw materials such as plastic resins and polymers used in the production of many of our products and higher spending related to quality assurance 
these higher costs approximately percentage points more than offset the improvement in margins we experienced as a result of the addition of the higher margin products acquired in the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition percentage points 
during and  respectively  we incurred million and million of acquisition related expenses which have been included in cost of sales 
the million of acquisition related charges included in costs of sales in  consists of the following million of expense which represents a portion of the step up to fair value recorded relating to the sale of inventory acquired through the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition  and million in charges representing the incremental costs we are incurring during a transition period in which we are continuing to purchase the acquired products from cr bard 
during  we expect to continue to experience higher incremental costs until manufacturing of the acquired products is fully integrated into our facilities and we have sold all of the higher cost inventory purchased from cr bard 
selling and administrative expense increased to million in as compared to million in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in this increase of percentage points is primarily attributable to increased administrative expenses associated with higher distribution costs percentage points due in part to higher petroleum prices  higher pension costs percentage points due primarily as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions see pension plan section of critical accounting estimates above  increased spending on corporate quality systems and management percentage points to ensure we continue to maintain appropriate regulatory compliance  increased selling and marketing costs associated with the endoscopic technologies business percentage points  other increases in selling and administrative costs percentage points including the johnson johnson litigation see note to the consolidated condensed financial statements

see additional discussion under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense in was million compared to million in the increase in interest expense is primarily a result of higher weighted average borrowings outstanding in as compared to and higher weighted average interest rates on our borrowings in as compared to in inclusive of the finance charge on our accounts receivable sale facility 
the increase in weighted average interest rates on our borrowing is primarily a result of our increased borrowings against our revolving credit facility coupled with overall increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
a provision for income taxes was recorded at an effective rate of in and in the effective rate for was higher than because the effective tax rate reflected an adjustment to the estimated benefit to be realized from the extraterritorial income exclusion tax rules on foreign sales 
a reconciliation of the united states statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is included in note to the consolidated financial statements

arthroscopy sales increased million in to million from million in  principally as a result of the bionx acquisition and increased sales of our procedure specific  knee reconstruction  soft tissue fixation and video imaging products for arthroscopy and general surgery 
this increase was offset in part by reduced sales of integrated operating room systems and equipment 
powered surgical instrument sales increased million in to million from million in  principally as a result of increased sales of our powerpro line of large bone instruments 
this increase was partially offset by decreased sales of our small bone instruments and specialty product offerings 
patient care sales increased million in to million from million in  principally as a result of increased sales of our pulse oximetry monitoring devices  ecg electrodes  surgical suction instruments and other patient care products

gross profit margins decreased from in to in we incurred million and million of acquisition related expenses during and  respectively  which have been included in cost of sales 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in as compared to is principally due to the increase in acquisition related expenses 
the million of acquisition related charges included in costs of sales in  consists of the following million of expense which represents a portion of the step up to fair value recorded relating to the sale of inventory acquired through the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition  and million in charges representing the incremental costs we incurred as part of the transition period in which we are continuing to purchase the acquired products from cr bard 
selling and administrative expense increased to million in as compared to million in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in this increase of percentage points is attributable to increased selling expenses primarily associated with the transition to a larger  independent sales agent based sales force in our arthroscopy and powered surgical instrument product lines percentage points and increased administrative expenses associated with litigation against johnson johnson see note to the consolidated financial statements and our sarbanes oxley compliance program percentage points 
research and development expense was million in compared to million in as a percentage of net sales  research and development expense increased to in from in the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of sales is principally a result of increased spending on the development of our pro reflectance pulse oximetry system and endotracheal cardiac output monitor for our patient care business 
the addition of the endoscopic technologies business in september also contributed to the increase in research and development expense 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we wrote off million and million of purchased in process research and development assets associated with the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition and bionx acquisition in and  respectively

see additional discussion under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense in was million compared to million in the decrease in interest expense is primarily a result of lower weighted average borrowings outstanding in as compared to and lower weighted average interest rates on our borrowings in as compared to in inclusive of the finance charge on our accounts receivable sale facility 
the decrease in weighted average interest rates on our borrowing is primarily a result of our redemption of million in senior subordinated notes in see note to the consolidated financial statements in favor of lower cost bank debt 
a provision for income taxes was recorded at an effective rate of in and in the effective rate for was lower than that recorded in and the united states statutory rate of as a result of an increase in the estimated benefits to be realized from the extraterritorial income exclusion eti tax rules on foreign sales 
the effective rate in increased from the statutory rate as a result of the non deductibility for income tax purposes of the bionx in process research and development charge discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity needs arise primarily from capital investments  working capital requirements and payments on indebtedness under the senior credit agreement 
we have historically met these liquidity requirements with funds generated from operations  including sales of accounts receivable and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  we use term borrowings  including borrowings under our senior credit agreement and borrowings under separate loan facilities  in the case of real property purchases  to finance our acquisitions 
we also have the ability to raise funds through the sale of stock or we may issue debt through a private placement or public offering 
we generally attempt to minimize our cash balances on hand and use available cash to pay down debt or repurchase our common stock 
operating cash flows our net working capital position was million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities declined in as compared to and on similar net income levels primarily because and net income included large non cash acquisition related in process research and development charges 
additionally  in we increased our inventory levels by million 
the increase in inventories was planned to ensure we have adequate inventories of endoscopic technologies product on hand as we transition the manufacturing to our own facilities from cr bard see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in we increased our inventories in order to ensure adequate stocks in order to avoid backorders and ensure a high level of customer service  particularly in the endosurgery product lines 
investing cash flows capital expenditures were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the continued increase in capital expenditures in as compared to and is primarily due to the ongoing expansion of our manufacturing and distribution capacity as a result of the bard endosocopic technologies acquisition 
these capital expenditures represent the ongoing capital investment requirements of our business and are expected to continue at the same approximate rate during payments related to business acquisitions in totaled million and are additional cash consideration paid for a business acquisition as a result of a purchase price adjustment 
investing cash flows in consisted of million in payments related to the bard endoscopic technologies acquisition 
financing cash flows net cash provided by used in financing activities during consisted of the following million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan see note to the consolidated financial statements  million in net repayments under the term loan facility of our senior credit agreement  million in borrowings under the revolving credit facility of our senior credit agreement  million in net repayments on mortgage notes  million net change in cash overdrafts  and the repurchase of million shares of our common stock under our board of director s authorized stock repurchase program at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
our senior credit agreement consists of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
at december  there was million outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
the aggregate amount outstanding on the term loan was million at december  the revolving credit facility expires in august the term loan is scheduled to be repaid in quarterly installments over a remaining period of approximately years  with scheduled principal payments of million annually through december increasing to million in and the remaining balance outstanding due in december we have made all scheduled term loan repayments as they have come due 
we may also be required  under certain circumstances  to make additional principal payments based on excess annual cash flow as defined in the senior credit agreement 
no such payments were required during interest rates on the term loan are at the london interbank offered rate libor plus at december  
interest rates on the revolving credit facility are at libor plus or an alternative base rate at december  
the senior credit agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our personal property and assets  except for our accounts receivable and related rights which have been sold in connection with our accounts receivable sales agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the senior credit agreement contains covenants and restrictions which  among other things  require maintenance of certain working capital levels and financial ratios  prohibit dividend payments and restrict the incurrence of certain indebtedness and other activities  including acquisitions and dispositions 
the senior credit agreement contains a material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to access additional funding under our revolving credit facility should a material adverse change in our business occur 
we are also required  under certain circumstances  to make mandatory prepayments from net cash proceeds from any issue of equity and asset sales 
mortgage notes outstanding in connection with the property and facilities utilized by our conmed linvatec subsidiary consist of a note bearing interest at per annum with semiannual payments of principal and interest through june the class a note  and a note bearing interest at per annum compounded semiannually through june  after which semiannual payments of principal and interest will commence  continuing through june the class c note 
the principal balances outstanding on the class a note and class c note aggregated million and million  respectively  at december  these mortgage notes are secured by the conmed linvatec property and facilities 
on november  we completed an offering of million in convertible senior subordinated notes the notes due this offering has allowed us to fix interest rates on million of our total outstanding long term debt at 
the notes represent subordinated unsecured obligations and are convertible under certain circumstances  as defined in the bond indenture  into a combination of cash and conmed common stock 
upon conversion  the holder of each note will receive the conversion value of the note payable in cash up to the principal amount of the note and conmed common stock for the note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount 
amounts in excess of the principal amount are at an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares per  principal amount of the note which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
the notes mature on november  and are not redeemable by us prior to november  holders of the notes will be able to require that we repurchase some or all of the notes on november   and the notes contain two embedded derivatives 
the embedded derivatives are recorded at fair value in other long term liabilities and changes in their value are recorded through the consolidated statement of income 
the embedded derivatives have a nominal value  and it is our belief that any change in their fair value would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
proceeds from the offering and cash on hand were used to repay million on the term loan and a further million in borrowings then outstanding on the revolving credit facility under our senior credit agreement 
additionally  in conjunction with the notes offering  we repurchased million of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result of the million prepayment on the term loan  we recorded million in losses on the early extinguishment of debt related to the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees 
our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to million of our common stock  although no more than million may be purchased in any calendar year 
the repurchase program calls for shares to be purchased in the open market or in private transactions from time to time 
we may suspend or discontinue the share repurchase program at any time 
during  we repurchased million in common stock in order to offset the dilutive effect of the issuance of shares under our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
we have financed the repurchases and expect to finance additional repurchases through the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option plans  from operating cash flow and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
management believes that cash flow from operations  including accounts receivable sales  cash and cash equivalents on hand and available borrowing capacity under our senior credit agreement will be adequate to meet our anticipated operating working capital requirements  debt service  funding of capital expenditures and common stock repurchases in the foreseeable future 
see item business forward looking statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have an accounts receivable sales agreement pursuant to which we and certain of our subsidiaries sell on an ongoing basis certain accounts receivable to conmed receivables corporation crc  a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote  special purpose subsidiary of conmed corporation 
crc may in turn sell up to an aggregate million undivided percentage ownership interest in such receivables the asset interest to a bank the purchaser 
the purchaser s share of collections on accounts receivable are calculated as defined in the accounts receivable sales agreement  as amended 
effectively  collections on the pool of receivables flow first to the purchaser and then to crc  but to the extent that the purchaser s share of collections may be less than the amount of the purchaser s asset interest  there is no recourse to conmed or crc for such shortfall 
for receivables which have been sold  conmed corporation and its subsidiaries retain collection and administrative responsibilities as agent for the purchaser 
as of december  and  the undivided percentage ownership interest in receivables sold by crc to the purchaser aggregated million and million  respectively  which has been accounted for as a sale and reflected in the balance sheet as a reduction in accounts receivable 
expenses associated with the sale of accounts receivable  including the purchaser s financing costs to purchase the accounts receivable  were million and million  in and  respectively  and are included in interest expense 
there are certain statistical ratios  primarily related to sales dilution and losses on accounts receivable  which must be calculated and maintained on the pool of receivables in order to continue selling to the purchaser 
the pool of receivables is in full compliance with these ratios 
management believes that additional accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business will be of sufficient quality and quantity to meet the requirements for sale under the accounts receivables sales agreement 
in the event that new accounts receivable arising in the normal course of business do not qualify for sale  then collections on sold receivables will flow to the purchaser rather than being used to fund new receivable purchases 
to the extent that such collections would not be available to conmed in the form of new receivables purchases  we would need to access an alternate source of working capital  such as our million revolving credit facility 
our accounts receivable sales agreement  as amended  also requires us to obtain a commitment the purchaser commitment  on an annual basis  from the purchaser to fund the purchase of our accounts receivable 
the purchaser commitment was amended effective october  whereby it was extended for an additional year under substantially the same terms and conditions 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter amounts in thousands 
purchase obligations represent purchase orders for goods and services placed in the ordinary course of business 
there were no capital lease obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt      purchase obligations   operating lease obligations      total contractual obligations     in addition to the above contractual obligations  we are required to make periodic interest payments on our long term debt obligations  see additional discussion under item a

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities and as necessary through the use of derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk a significant portion of our operations consist of sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  our financial results may be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the markets in which we distribute products 
as of december   we have not entered into any foreign exchange forward or option contracts designed to hedge the effect of foreign currency transactions 
we have mitigated the effect of foreign currency exchange rate risk by transacting a significant portion of our foreign sales in united states dollars 
during  changes in currency exchange rates increased sales by approximately million and income before income taxes by approximately million 
in the future  we will continue to evaluate our foreign currency exposure and assess the need to enter into derivative contracts which hedge foreign currency transactions 
interest rate risk at december   we had approximately million of variable rate long term debt under our senior credit agreement  we are not a party to any interest rate swap agreements as of december  assuming no repayments other than our scheduled term loan payments  if market interest rates for similar borrowings average more in than they did in  interest expense would increase  and income before income taxes would decrease by million 
comparatively  if market interest rates for similar borrowings average less in than they did in  our interest expense would decrease  and income before income taxes would increase by million
