item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
in addition  actual capital ratios and regulatory ratios are compared and commented on in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included as part of this form k  under the caption regulatory matters 
the company is well capitalized in all measured categories 
the risk based capital guidelines of the federal regulatory agencies explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and the risk arising from non traditional activities  as well as an institution s ability to manage these risks  as important factors to be taken into account by the agencies in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy 
the capital guidelines also provide that an institution s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates be considered by the agency as a factor in evaluating a banking organization s capital adequacy 
the company and its subsidiary banks are also subject to certain other recent federal laws which directly impact operations of the company usa patriot act the usa patriot act became effective in october and provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering 
among other provisions  the usa patriot act permits financial institutions  upon providing notice to the united states treasury  to share information with one another in order to better identify and report to the federal government activities that may involve money laundering or terrorists activities 
the usa patriot act is considered a significant banking law in terms of information disclosure regarding certain customer transactions 
although it does create a reporting obligation  evb has not experienced a material effect on products  services or other business activities since implementing the usa patriot act requirements 
the federal bureau of investigation fbi has sent  and will send  our banking regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of terrorist activities 
the banks have been requested  and will be requested  to search their records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists 
if the banks find any relationship or transactions  they must file a suspicious activity report and contact the fbi 
the office of foreign assets control ofac  which is a division of the department of the treasury  is responsible for helping to ensure that united states entities do not engage in transactions with enemies of the united states  as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress 
every two weeks  ofac sends electronic lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding  harboring or engaging in terrorist acts 
if the banks databases find a matching name on any account  or wire transfer that is on an ofac list  the banks must freeze such accounts  file a suspicious activity report and notify the fbi 
gramm leach bliley act of glba the glba implemented major changes to the statutory framework for providing banking and other financial services in the united states 
the glba covers a broad range of issues  including the repeal of most of the restrictions on affiliations among depository institutions  securities firms and insurance companies 
the act 
table of contents repeals sections of and of the glass stegall act  thus permitting unrestricted affiliations between banks and securities firms 
the act also permits bank holding companies to elect to become financial holding companies 
a financial holding company may engage in or acquire companies that engage in a broad range of financial services  including securities activities such as underwriting  dealing  brokerage  investment and merchant banking  insurance underwriting  sales and brokerage activities 
the act provides that the states continue to have the authority to regulate insurance activities  but prohibits the states in most instances from preventing or significantly interfering with the ability of a bank  directly or through an affiliate  to engage in insurance sales  solicitations or cross marketing activities 
although the states generally must regulate bank insurance activities in a nondiscriminatory manner  the states may continue to adopt and enforce rules that specifically regulate bank insurance activities in certain areas identified in the act 
the act adopts a system of functional regulation under which the federal reserve board is confirmed as the umbrella regulator for financial holding companies  but financial holding company affiliates are to be principally regulated by functional regulators such as the fdic for state nonmember bank affiliates  the sec for securities affiliates and state insurance regulators for insurance affiliates 
to become eligible for these activities  a bank holding company must qualify as a financial holding company 
in order to become a financial holding company  the bank holding company and all of its affiliated depository institutions must be well capitalized  well managed  and have at least a satisfactory community reinvestment act rating 
in addition  the bank holding company must file with the federal reserve a declaration of its intention to become a financial holding company 
while evb satisfies these requirements  the company has not found a sufficient business reason to elect to be treated as a financial holding company under the glba 
bank secrecy act the glba and the bank secrecy act contain extensive customer privacy protection provisions 
under these provisions  a financial institution must provide to its customers  at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter  the institution s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers nonpublic personal financial information 
the act provides that  except for certain limited exceptions  an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to its customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure 
an institution may not disclose to a non affiliated third party  other than to a consumer reporting agency  customer account numbers or other similar account identifiers for marketing purposes 
the act also provides that the states may adopt customer privacy protections that are stricter than those contained in the act 
the act also makes a criminal offense  except in limited circumstances  obtaining or attempting to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means 
community reinvestment act southside bank is subject to the requirements of the community reinvestment act cra 
the cra imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions 
a financial institution s efforts in meeting community credit needs are currently evaluated as part of the examination process pursuant to twelve assessment factors 
these factors are considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility 
at this time  the other banks are not subject to the requirements  but will be under the new one bank organization 
sarbanes oxley act of sox the sarbanes oxley act of  primarily provides for the improvement of corporate governance and reporting 
a major part of sox is section  which requires certain companies to provide a report on their internal controls over financial reporting 
this internal control report must state the responsibility of management for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting  and 
table of contents contain an assessment  as of the end of the most recent fiscal year of the issuer  of the effectiveness of the internal control structure and procedures of the issuer for financial reporting 
this assessment of internal controls over financial reporting requires management to maintain evidential matter  including documentation  to support its assessment 
section also requires an attestation report from the issuer s registered public accounting firm 
the company believes it is fully complying with sox 
in the second year of implementation   the company has continued to monitor its internal controls as a normal course of business and to maintain control as the company goes through reorganizing and centralizing many of its reporting lines and backroom operations 
see item a below for more information 
item a 
risk factors an investment in the company s common stock involves significant risks inherent to the company s business 
the risks and uncertainties that management believes affect or could affect the company are described below 
you should carefully read and consider these risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report  before you decide to invest in our common stock 
we may incur losses if we are unable to successfully manage interest rate risk 
our profitability will depend in substantial part upon the spread between the interest rates earned on investments and loans and interest rates paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
these rates are normally in line with our competition with rises and falls based on the asset liability committee s vision of the company s needs 
however  the company may pay above market rates to attract deposits as we have done in some of our marketing promotions in the past 
changes in interest rates will affect our operating performance and financial condition in diverse ways including the pricing of securities  loans and deposits  and the volume of loan originations in our mortgage banking business 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  but we will be unable to eliminate it 
our net interest spread will depend on many factors that are partly or entirely outside our control  including competition  federal economic  monetary and fiscal policies  and economic conditions generally 
we may be adversely affected by economic conditions in our market area 
we operate in a mixed market environment with influences from both rural and urban areas 
because our lending is concentrated in these markets  we will be affected by the general economic conditions in the eastern  richmond and tidewater areas of virginia 
changes in the economy may influence the growth rate of our loans and deposits  the quality of the loan portfolio and loan and deposit pricing and the performance of our mortgage subsidiary 
a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond our control would impact these local economic conditions and the demand for banking products and services generally  which could negatively affect our financial condition and performance 
although we might not have significant credit exposure to all the businesses in our areas  the downturn in any of these businesses could have a negative impact on local economic conditions and real estate collateral values generally  which could negatively affect our profitability 
our concentration in loans secured by real estate may increase our credit losses  which would negatively affect our financial results 
we offer a variety of secured loans  including commercial lines of credit  commercial term loans  real estate  construction  home equity  consumer and other loans 
many of our loans are secured by real estate both residential and commercial in our market area 
a major change in the real estate market  such as a deterioration in the value of this collateral  or in the local or national economy  could adversely affect our customers ability to pay these loans  which in turn could impact us 
risk of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking 
table of contents industry  and we try to limit our exposure to this risk by monitoring our extensions of credit carefully 
we cannot fully eliminate credit risk  and as a result credit losses may occur in the future 
if our allowance for loan losses becomes inadequate  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is a reasonable estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio 
through a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio  management determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses by considering general market conditions  credit quality of the loan portfolio  the collateral supporting the loans and performance of our customers relative to their financial obligations with us 
the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  which may be beyond our control  and these losses may exceed our current estimates 
rapidly growing loan portfolios are  by their nature  unseasoned 
as a result  estimating loan loss allowances is more difficult  and may be more susceptible to changes in estimates  and to losses exceeding estimates  than more seasoned portfolios 
although we believe the allowance for loan losses is a reasonable estimate of known and inherent losses in our loan portfolio  we cannot fully predict such losses or that our loan loss allowance will be adequate in the future 
excessive loan losses could have a material impact on our financial performance 
consistent with our loan loss reserve methodology  we expect to make additions to our loan loss reserve levels as a result of our loan growth  which may affect our short term earnings 
federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of our management 
any increase in the amount of our provision or loans charged off as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our operating results 
our future success is dependent on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive banking industry 
we face vigorous competition from other banks and other financial institutions  including savings and loan associations  savings banks  finance companies and credit unions for deposits  loans and other financial services in our market area 
a number of these banks and other financial institutions are significantly larger than we are and have substantially greater access to capital and other resources  as well as larger lending limits and branch systems  and offer a wider array of banking services 
to a limited extent  we also compete with other providers of financial services  such as money market mutual funds  brokerage firms  consumer finance companies  insurance companies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable financing than we can 
many of our non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern us 
as a result  these non bank competitors have advantages over us in providing certain services 
this competition may reduce or limit our margins and our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our profitability may suffer because of rapid and unpredictable changes in the highly regulated environment in which we operate 
the banking industry is subject to extensive regulation by state and federal banking authorities 
many of the banking regulations we are governed by are intended to protect depositors  the public or the insurance funds maintained by the federal deposit insurance corporation  not shareholders 
banking regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and many other aspects of our business 
these requirements may constrain our rate of growth and changes in regulations could adversely affect us 
the burden imposed by these federal and state regulations may place banks in a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors 
in addition  the cost of compliance with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
see supervision and regulation for more information about applicable banking laws and regulations 

table of contents we may not be able to successfully manage our growth  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
during the last five years  we have experienced significant growth  and a key aspect of our business strategy is our continued growth and expansion 
our ability to continue to grow depends  in part  upon our ability to open new branch offices or acquire existing branches or other financial institutions  attract deposits to those locations  and identify attractive loan and investment opportunities 
we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy if we are unable to identify attractive markets  locations or opportunities to expand in the future 
our ability to manage our growth successfully also will depend on whether we can maintain capital levels adequate to support our growth  maintain cost controls and asset quality and successfully integrate any businesses we acquire into our organization 
as we continue to implement our growth strategy by opening new branches or acquiring branches or other banks  we expect to incur increased personnel  occupancy and other operating expenses 
in the case of new branches  we must absorb those higher expenses while we begin to generate new deposits  and there is a further time lag involved in redeploying new deposits into attractively priced loans and other higher yielding earning assets 
thus  our plans to branch aggressively could depress our earnings in the short run  even if we efficiently execute our branching strategy 
we rely heavily on our management team and the unexpected loss of any of those personnel could adversely affect our operations  we depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
we are a customer focused and relationship driven organization 
we expect our future growth to be driven in a large part by the relationships maintained with our customers by our chairman  president and other senior officers 
we have entered into employment agreements with five our executive officers 
the existence of such agreements  however  does not necessarily assure that we will be able to continue to retain their services 
the unexpected loss of any of our key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and possibly result in reduced revenues and earnings 
we do maintain bank owned life insurance on key officers that would help cover some of the economic impact of a loss caused by death 
the implementation of our business strategy will also require us to continue to attract  hire  motivate and retain skilled personnel to develop new customer relationships as well as new financial products and services 
many experienced banking professionals employed by our competitors are covered by agreements not to compete or solicit their existing customers if they were to leave their current employment 
these agreements make the recruitment of these professionals more difficult 
the market for these people is competitive  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting  hiring  motivating or retaining them 
we may identify a material weakness or a significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting that may adversely affect our ability to properly account for non routine transactions 
as we have grown and expanded  we have acquired and added  and expect to continue to acquire and add  businesses and other activities that complement our core retail and commercial banking functions 
such acquisitions or additions frequently involve complex operational and financial reporting issues that can influence management s internal control system 
while we make every effort to thoroughly understand any new activity or acquired entity s business processes  our planning for proper integration into our company can give no assurance that we will not encounter operational and financial reporting difficulties impacting our controls over the company 

table of contents if we need additional capital in the future to continue our growth  we may not be able to obtain it on terms that are favorable 
this could negatively affect our performance and the value of our common stock 
our business strategy calls for continued growth 
we anticipate that we will be able to support this growth through the generation of additional deposits at new branch locations as well as investment opportunities 
however  we may need to raise additional capital in the future to support our continued growth and to maintain our capital levels 
our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional securities will depend primarily upon our financial condition and the condition of financial markets at that time 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital in the amounts or on terms satisfactory to us 
our growth may be constrained if we are unable to raise additional capital as needed 
we may in the future issue additional stock  any or all of which will dilute your percentage ownership and  possibly  the value of your shares 
our board of directors generally has the authority to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued common shares without prior shareholder approval and without allowing the shareholders the right to purchase their pro rata portion of such shares 
this includes shares authorized to be issued under our stock option plans 
the issuance of any new common shares will dilute your percentage ownership  and could dilute the value of your shares 
because our mortgage banking revenue is sensitive to changes in economic conditions  decreased economic activity  a slowdown in the housing market or high interest rates may reduce our profits 
maintaining a high level of fees from this operation depends primarily on our ability to continue to originate mortgage loans 
production levels are sensitive to changes in economic conditions and can suffer from decreased economic activity  a slowdown in the housing market or higher interest rates 
generally  any sustained period of decreased economic activity or higher interest rates could adversely affect our mortgage originations and  consequently  reduce our income from mortgage banking activities 
as a result  these conditions may adversely affect our net income

forward looking statements certain information contained in this discussion may include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements are generally identified by phrases such as the company expects  the company believes or words of similar import 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks including  but not limited to interest rate fluctuations risk inherent in making loans such as repayment risks and fluctuating collateral values

critical accounting policies general the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
for example  we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ substantially from the historical factors that we use 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i sfas no  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and ii sfas no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of the collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the company evaluates loans individually for impairment that are non performing  such as nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management as required by sfas no 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of the impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the company makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas no 
loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon historical loss rates for each loan type  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans including borrower or industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending staff  and national and economic conditions 

table of contents the amounts of estimated losses for loans individually evaluated for impairment and groups of loans are added together for a total estimate of loan losses 
the estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of the company as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses is greater that the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether a reduction to the allowance would be necessary 
while management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations 
such adjustments would be made in the relevant period and may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
executive overview while evb increased net interest income by for the year ended december   this was counteracted by increased noninterest expenses which lowered net income and earnings per share 
the higher noninterest expense was the result of the company s backroom centralization project  the full expense impact of two new branches  and the initial impact of the planned one bank reorganization 
the company had net income of million  or per share on a basic and a diluted basis  down from million and per share on basic and per share on a diluted basis for return on average assets roa for was compared to in the prior year  and the return on average equity roe was for compared to in core earnings during the period from to continued to improve as net interest income increased by and noninterest income excluding realized gains on securities increased from the prior year 
as stated this was largely offset by an increase in noninterest expenses which reflects a slowing of the higher expense rate when compared to a increase in noninterest expenses between and as the company went through the year  it continued to feel the expense impact of the re engineering project  sox  the new branches  new training to raise the level of customer service and the initial impact of the one bank reorganization project 
it benefited from both loan growth and better asset quality which should carry forward into while most of the major costs associated with sox hit in  the costs to continue the procedures and maintain effective control of the company are on going 
a grid outlining the control responsibilities of all divisions has to be maintained and revised as the company changes 
the company hired an outside consultant to perform sox reviews and many internal audit functions 
the external audit firm has more responsibilities to review the control environment of the company and thus higher fees 
in addition  the company continues to conduct training for all government compliance requirements 
late in  southside bank opened the central garage branch in king william county near the crossroads of route and route in june  southside bank opened a branch in glenns  along the route corridor to hampton roads 
while these branches have grown  their contribution in was mostly expenses 
management expects a higher contribution to expense coverage in through higher branch earnings 
customer service training was introduced late in the third quarter to make the whole company aware of the best practices in handling both external customer and internal bank employee calls for service or information 
this training was presented to all the employees 
this is an initial step to develop a sales culture within the company  so the employees can better recognize and effectively meet the needs of our customers 
finally  towards the end of the year  the company announced plans to transform itself from a three bank holding company to a one bank holding company 
this process will further streamline backroom processes by creating a unified process company wide and minimize various reporting requirements from three banks to one 
the costs associated with this began in the fourth quarter of and will most likely end in the second quarter of 
table of contents with all these non income producing projects going on  the company increased loan volume and the associated income very well 
even more important  the overall asset quality is at its highest level in the history of the company 
while the federal reserve continues increasing interest rates  future net interest income from loan rate growth could be squeezed by higher cost deposits  since the demand for funds from all financial sectors will drive up the cost of customer deposits

for comparative purposes  income from tax exempt securities is adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 
tax exempt securities income is further adjusted by the tax equity fiscal responsibility act tefra adjustment for the disallowance as a deduction of a portion of total interest expense related to the ratio of average tax exempt securities to average total assets 
this adjustment results in tax exempt income and yields being presented on a basis comparable with income and yields from fully taxable earning assets 
net interest margin represents the company s net interest income divided by average earning assets 
changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
the average balances  income and expense  yields and rates table presents average balances  related interest income and expense  and average yield cost data for each of the past three years

large dollar certificates of deposit are certificates issued in amounts of  or greater 

table of contents tax equivalent net interest income increased in to million from million in average earning asset growth of produced million of increased interest income  while interest bearing liabilities grew producing a million increase in interest expense 
the increase in net interest income resulted from a combination of higher volume and rates in earning assets  a volume increase in both large denomination certificates of deposit and long term borrowings and higher rates on all interest bearing liabilities except interest checking 
the increased cost of deposits and borrowings seen in the rate column  more than offset the increase from rates in the earning assets 
the federal reserve continued to raise rates throughout which caused customers to move out of lower yielding deposits and into higher yielding certificates of deposit or other investments outside of the bank 
the company did have an increase in demand deposits with most of this coming in personal and business checking 
the slowing of deposit growth resulted in an increase in other borrowings and a liquidating of securities to help fuel the loan growth 
the company had a net interest margin of for  an eleven basis point decrease from in yield on earning assets increased basis points to in from in  while the cost of interest bearing funds increased basis points from in to in the higher increase in interest expense more than offset the increase in earning assets  resulting in an basis point decrease in the net interest margin 
in  the company expects the cost of deposits will further squeeze the net interest margin until rates stop rising 
historically  the net interest margin pressure caused by an economic environment with a flat or inverted yield curve has proved extremely challenging for the banking industry 
at june   just as the federal open market committee began raising the federal funds rate  which resulted in a matching increase in the wall street prime rate  the yield on a three month maturity treasury bond was or basis points below the yield on a five year treasury and basis points below the yield on a year treasury 
by february  that yield had inverted to the point that a three month treasury was yielding  while both the five year and ten year treasury were yielding the exact same  the ten year treasury being below the level of months ago 
the yield curve change from a more than basis point premium for a longer investment to a position where there is no premium for time risk is presenting funding and interest margin management pressures to the company  as a flat or inverted yield curve significantly increases competition for deposits and their cost 
while deposit cost is increasing  the lack of a similar movement in longer term rates limits the yield increase on fixed rate loans 
as a result  management considers the short term risk of a further decrease in the net interest margin to be more likely than the potential of an increase in the margin 
average earning asset growth of resulted from increases in average loans outstanding of  a decrease in federal funds sold of and a slight decrease in average securities 
growth in average earning assets of million was primarily funded by average deposit growth of million and an increase in average borrowings of million 
in  net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased to million from million in average earning asset growth of was the primary factor in the increase in net interest income and in producing a net interest margin of  a basis point decrease from in

interest sensitivity evb s primary goals in interest rate risk management are to minimize negative fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets and to increase the dollar amount of net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets 
these goals are accomplished by managing the interest sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap is managed by balancing the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the average maturity of fixed rate asset and liability contracts reasonably consistent and short  and by routinely adjusting pricing to market conditions on a regular basis 
the company generally strives to maintain a position flexible enough to move to equality between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which may be desirable when there are wide and frequent fluctuations in interest rates 
matching the amount of assets and liabilities maturing in the same time interval helps to hedge interest rate risk and to minimize the impact on net interest income in periods of rising or falling interest rates 
when an unacceptable positive gap within a one year time frame occurs  maturities can be extended by selling shorter term investments and purchasing longer maturities 
when an unacceptable negative gap occurs  variable rate loans can be increased and more investment in shorter term investments can be made 
interest rate gaps are managed through investments  loan pricing and deposit pricing 
the banking industry traditionally faces funding challenges in an environment such as that currently in place when the yield curve is flat to inverted 
managing the interest rate gap has become much more challenging in this current rising rate environment where many depositors have chosen to move funds out of savings and money market accounts and into higher rate  longer maturity certificates of deposit or the securities market 
while this customer change in deposit preference unfavorably impacts the current interest margin  it creates an asset sensitive balance sheet  as more assets are subject to 
table of contents short term interest rate increases than the amount of liabilities subject to the same short term increases 
in the short term the company is currently asset sensitive but will swing to a liability sensitive status as progresses and depending on when interest rates stop rising

more consulting expenses  relating to the one bank project  are expected to be incurred in the first half of the increase in director fees was primarily the result of more meetings for the one bank project 
audit and accounting fees are up due to sox compliance which created an additional fee from the outside auditor for their attestation on the control system and the engaging of another consulting firm to do internal work in maintaining compliance of sox and other risk control audits

consumer loans are the fourth largest component of evb s loan portfolio in  dropping from third in consumer loans were of the loan portfolio at year end  and and at year end and respectively 
this portfolio component consists primarily of installment loans 
net consumer loans for household  family and other personal expenditures totaled million at year end  down million from million at year end 
general economic conditions and intense competition including various rebate programs with low rates by the automotive industry continued the trend that started in  decreasing consumer loans both in absolute amount and percentage of the total loan portfolio 
commercial and agricultural loans are designed specifically to meet the needs of small and medium size business customers 
this category of loans increased million in total loans outstanding at year end compared to  with the percentage to total loans increasing to of the total loan portfolio from at year end 
table of contents consistent with its focus on providing community based financial services  evb generally does not make loans outside of its principal market region 
the company does not engage in foreign lending activities  consequently the loan portfolio is not exposed to the sometimes volatile risk from foreign credits 
evb further maintains a policy not to originate or purchase loans classified by regulators as highly leveraged transactions or loans to foreign entities or individuals 
the company s unfunded loan commitments  excluding credit card lines and letters of credit  at year end totaled million  up million from million at december  unfunded loan commitments excluding million in home equity lines are used in large part to meet seasonal funding needs which are generally higher from spring through fall than at year end 
historically  evb s loan collateral has been primarily real estate because of the nature of our market region 
asset quality the company s allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the amount needed to provide for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
in determining adequacy of the allowance  management considers the company s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  specific impaired loans  the overall level of nonaccrual loans  the value and adequacy of collateral and guarantors  experience and depth of lending staff  effects of credit concentrations and economic conditions 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
because the risk of loan loss includes general economic trends as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses can only be an estimate 
evb s ratio of nonperforming assets in decreased to down from in and marking the lowest level this ratio has been at in the history of the company 
actual nonperforming assets decreased to million at year end  compared to million at year end net charge offs for decreased thousand or to thousand  compared to million for the year 
each of evb s subsidiary banks has a loan review function consisting of bank officers and board members 
additionally an independent credit review firm performs a review of loans for each of the banks  including a sfas no 
review for determining specific reserves 
the company utilizes a risk based evaluation system based on loan type  collateral and payment history to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes the allowance for loan losses to be adequate based on this loan review process and analysis 
the company s improved asset quality in allowed evb to lower its loan loss allowance ratio to at year end  compared to at december  and at year end  respectively 
for the same dates  the loan loss allowance to nonaccrual loans ratio was  and  indicating that the allowance was adequate with respect to nonaccrual loans 
the allowance for loan losses is subject to regulatory examinations which may take into account such factors as methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance in comparison to peer companies identified by regulatory agencies

based on estimated fair values of the related collateral  management considers the nonperforming real estate loans recoverable  with any individual deficiency well covered by the allowance for loan losses 
the total amount of unsecured nonaccrual loans was thousand 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status at the time when the collection of principal and interest are considered to be doubtful 
no interest is accrued on loans placed in a nonaccrual status  and any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed when a loan is placed in nonaccrual status 
if interest on nonaccrual loans had been accrued  such income would have approximated thousand and thousand for the years and  respectively

table of contents deposits the company has historically focused on increasing core deposits to reduce the need for other borrowings to fund growth in earning assets 
core deposits provide a low cost and stable source of funding for the company s asset growth 
interest rates paid on deposits are carefully managed to provide an attractive market rate while at the same time not adversely affecting the net interest margin 
borrowing through the federal home loan bank of atlanta is utilized for funding when the cost of borrowed funds falls below the cost of new interest bearing deposits 
evb s million  or  deposit growth in was less than its loan growth requiring the company to spend more for deposits and borrow from the fhlb to fund loan growth 
total deposits at december  of million compared to million at year end 
noninterest bearing deposits increased million or to million at year end compared to million at december  during the same period  interest bearing deposits increased to million at year end  compared to million at december  while these figures represent the balances at december  or  it is more meaningful to review average deposits for the year which reflect how much the company is really funding over the year

average deposits for decreased in all categories except large certificates of deposit and noninterest bearing demand deposits  while the demand increase helps the overall cost of funds  the increase in the most expensive funding category tightened the interest margin 
management anticipates that this tightening will continue as long as the federal reserve continues to raise rates 
total deposits at year end of million reflected an increase of million or compared to million at year end 
the meager increase in deposit growth in was the result of management not raising deposit rates quickly as the loans repriced at higher rates

capital represents original investment by shareholders along with retained earnings and provides financial resources over which management can exercise greater control as compared to deposits and borrowed funds 
regulatory authorities have adopted guidelines to establish minimum capital standards 
specifically  the guidelines classify assets and balance sheet items into four risk weighted categories 
the minimum regulatory total capital to risk weighted assets is  of which at least must be tier capital  defined as common equity and retained earnings  plus trust preferred debt up to of tier capital  less goodwill and intangibles 
at december   evb had a total capital ratio of and a tier ratio of  both far in excess of regulatory guidelines and the amount needed to support each subsidiary s banking business 
capital is carefully managed as the financial opportunities of a high capital base are weighed against the impact of the return on equity ratio

guaranteed credit card balances were purchased in and added to the company s credit card balances 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
the commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by the company  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit  revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
these lines of credit are usually uncollateralized and do not always contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the company is committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the company generally holds collateral supporting those commitments if deemed necessary 

table of contents liquidity liquidity represents an institution s ability to meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional funds through liability management 
liquid assets include cash  deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  investments and loans maturing or repricing within one year 
evb s management of liquid assets provides a liquidity level which management believes is sufficient to satisfy its depositors requirements and to meet its customers credit needs 
at december   million or of total earning assets were due to mature or reprice within the next year 
evb also maintains additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements 
federal funds borrowing arrangements with major regional banks combined with lines of credit with the federal home loan bank totaled million at december  at year end  the company had million of fhlb borrowings outstanding 
during  the company borrowed million in new fhlb borrowings and paid down principle of on preexisting fhlb borrowings

as of payments due by period total less than year years years over years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total inflation in financial institutions  unlike most manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rate movement is not necessarily tied to movements in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
evb s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the company s management is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of evb s subsidiary banks and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
the board of directors reviews guidelines established by management 
it is evb s policy not to engage in activities considered to be derivative in nature such as futures  option contracts  swaps  caps  floors  collars or forward commitments 
evb considers derivatives as speculative which is contrary to the company s historical or prospective philosophy 
evb does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
it does hold in its loan and security portfolio investments that adjust or float according to changes in the prime lending rate which is not considered speculative  but necessary for good asset liability management 

table of contents asset liability risk management the primary goals of asset liability risk management are to maximize net interest income and the net value of evb s future cash flows within the interest rate limits set by the company s asset liability committee alco 
interest rate risk measurement interest rate risk is monitored through the use of three complementary measures static gap analysis  earnings simulation modeling and net present value estimation 
while each of the interest rate risk measurements has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the company  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
static gap gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk embedded in the balance sheet at a point in time 
it does so by comparing the differences in the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
a gap is defined as the difference between the principal amount of assets and liabilities  adjusted for off balance sheet instruments  which reprice within a specific time period 
the cumulative one year gap at year end was which is within the policy limit for the one year gap of plus to minus of total earning assets at a combined company level 
core deposits and loans with noncontractual maturities are included in the gap repricing distributions based upon historical patterns determined by statistical analysis  based upon industry accepted assumptions including the most recent core deposit defaults set forth by the ffiec federal financial institutions examination council 
the gap repricing distributions include principal cash flows from residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities in the time frames in which they are expected to be received 
mortgage prepayments are estimated by applying industry median projections of prepayment speeds to portfolio segments based on coupon range and loan age 
earnings simulation the earnings simulation model forecasts one year net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effects on income of alternative interest rate scenarios against earnings in a stable interest rate environment 
this type of analysis is also most useful in determining the short run earnings exposures to changes in customer behavior involving loan payments and deposit additions and withdrawals 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects net income would decrease approximately of stable rate net income if rates were to fall immediately by basis points 
it projects an increase of approximately if rates rise by basis points 
management believes this reflects a liability sensitive interest risk for the one year horizon 
this dynamic simulation model includes assumptions about how the balance sheet is likely to evolve through time  in different interest rate environments 
loan and deposit growth rate assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook  as are the assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry median estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
noncontractual deposit growth rates and pricing are assumed to follow historical patterns 
the sensitivities of key assumptions are analyzed at least annually and reviewed by management 
net present value the net present value npv of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows 
interest rate risk analysis using npv involves changing the interest rates used in determining the cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in npv is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 

table of contents at year end  a basis point immediate increase in rates is estimated to decrease npv by 
additionally  npv is estimated to increase by if rates fall immediately by basis points 
analysis of the average quarterly change in the treasury yield curve over the past ten years indicates that a parallel curve shift of basis points or more is an event that has less than a chance of occurrence 
as with gap analysis and earnings simulation modeling  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in npv analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving mortgage prepayments and the assumptions about expected attrition of the core deposit portfolios 
these assumptions are applied consistently across the different rate risk measures
