changes in the market conditions could require a write down of inventory 
valuation of long lived assets the company periodically reviews the carrying value of long lived assets and estimated depreciable or amortizable lives for continued appropriateness 
this review is based upon projections of anticipated future cash flows and is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that asset carrying values may not be recoverable or that the estimated depreciable or amortizable lives may have changed 
these evaluations could result in a change in estimated useful lives in future periods

see interest rate risk in item a 
below

at june   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the credit agreement 
the company financed the purchase of delivery equipment in december through a five year fixed rate note at 
the note requires payments through december the delivery equipment purchased with the note proceeds secures the note 
increased operating costs are reflected in product or services pricing with any limitations on price increases determined by the marketplace 
the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant during the past three years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states 
raw material costs  labor costs and interest rates are important components of costs for the company 
any or all of these components could be impacted by inflation or other pricing pressures  with a possible adverse effect on our profitability  especially where increases in these costs exceed price increases on finished products 
in recent years  the company has faced strong inflationary and other pricing pressures with respect to steel  fuel and health care costs  which have been partially mitigated by pricing adjustments 
other than operating leases  the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
outlook flexsteel industries  inc and the other us furniture manufacturers continue to be impacted by the increases in interest rates and geopolitical issues leading to increased energy costs and consumer uncertainty 
at the same time  the us furniture industry continues to evolve and globalize at a staggering rate 
us manufacturers are faced with increases in the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead costs  including fuel  accompanied by an increased flow of competing product from all over the world generally produced with lower manufacturing costs all of which added to product pricing pressures 
additionally  the distribution channels are changing and increasingly include non traditional customers such as mass merchandisers  wholesale clubs and specialty retail chains in addition to e commerce opportunities 
for the fiscal year ended june   residential net sales were weaker than anticipated and we expect that this softness will continue through the first half of fiscal year due to the uncertainties described above 
net sales of vehicle seating products have fallen off due to a weak wholesale market environment 
while vehicle seating product net sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal showed an increase over the prior year quarter  a sustained improvement in demand has not yet been confirmed 
additionally  the volatility and high cost of fuel may temper the favorable longer term demographics that exist in the recreational vehicle industry 
our commercial marketing channels provide an opportunity to expand distribution and increase net sales for fiscal commercial office furniture net sales are expected to benefit from a continued general increase in demand for these products and we have expanded our product offerings to capitalize on this market area 
hospitality occupancy rates continue strong which has led to an increase in construction and renovation activity 
these activities have increased the demand for the hospitality products we offer 
the increased cost of raw materials  component parts and fuel created continued pressures on margins through all of fiscal year and we expect these pressures to continue into fiscal year during fiscal year  we were able to maintain our margins through cost controls  the implementation of a fuel surcharge on product delivery and selected product sale price increases 
we expect that fuel costs will continue to rise and to negatively impact the cost of bringing raw materials  component parts and sourced finished products into our facilities as well as the cost of delivering products to our customers 
we anticipate that petroleum prices will remain volatile and at record or near record levels for the foreseeable future 
the result will be continuing cost increases and we believe a factor in keeping consumers on the sideline for furniture purchases  negatively affecting demand for residential and vehicle seating products 
flexsteel continues to take actions to address the above concerns including new product introductions  refining existing product offerings  adjusting selling and delivery prices  adjusting production levels and implementing cost control measures for inventory and capital expenditures 
these actions occur regularly regardless of operating performance  but will continue to receive additional attention under current business conditions 
management believes that flexsteel is also in a unique position to take advantage of the rapid change that is affecting most of the markets we serve 
we have had a successful introduction of our complete new line of wrangler home collection 
we continue to develop products for the marine industry to augment our vehicle seating products 
we believe that our commercial office product lineup is strong and expanded to continue to take advantage as demand for this product increases 
we believe that our hospitality team is poised to deliver the needed products as this market expansion continues 
we continue to believe that our strategy of providing furniture from a wide selection of domestically manufactured and imported products is sound business practice 
this blended strategy gives flexsteel the opportunity to successfully participate in all the important avenues of furniture distribution in the united states 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
as discussed below  management of the company does not believe that changes in these factors could cause material fluctuations in the company s results of operations or cash flows 
the ability to import furniture products can be adversely affected by political issues in the countries where suppliers are located and disruptions associated with shipping distances 
other risks related to furniture product importation include government imposition of regulations and or quotas  duties and taxes on imports  and significant fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
any of these factors could interrupt supply  increase costs and decrease earnings 
impairment of long lived assets accounting rules require that long lived assets be evaluated for impairment at least annually 
we have substantial long lived assets  consisting mainly of property  plant and equipment  which based upon the outcome of the annual evaluation could result in the write down of all or a portion of these assets and a corresponding reduction in our earnings and net worth 
at june   no impairment of long lived assets has been identified 
foreign currency risk during fiscal  and  the company did not have sales  purchases  or other expenses denominated in foreign currencies  nor did it have any active subsidiaries located in foreign countries 
as such  the company is not exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
at june   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would decrease annual pre tax earnings by approximately  assuming no change in the volume or composition of debt 
the company has effectively fixed the interest rates at on approximately million of its long term debt through the use of interest rate swaps  and the above estimated earnings reduction takes these swaps into account 
as of june   the fair value of these swaps is an asset of approximately million and is included in other assets 
tariffs the company has exposure to actions by governments  including tariffs 
tariffs are a possibility on any imported or exported products 
tariff expense on wooden bedroom furniture imported from china  which represents less than of the company s net sales  is based on the most current rates published by the department of commerce 
these rates are potentially subject to an administrative review process starting approximately one year after the publication date 
the final amounts will depend on whether administrative reviews are performed and the outcome of those reviews  if any  on the vendors we purchase from 
the company continues to review alternate sources of product supply to minimize the impact of the tariffs
