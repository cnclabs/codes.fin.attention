table of contents we consider the criteria presented in emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining the appropriate revenue recognition treatment 
generally  when we are the primary obligor in a transaction  have general inventory risk  have established the selling price  have discretion in supplier selection  have physical loss inventory risk after order placement or during shipping and have credit risk  or have several but not all of these indicators  we record revenue gross as a principal 
we recognize revenue from product sales  net of estimated returns based on historical experience and current trends  upon shipment of products to customers 
we ship the majority of products from our fulfillment centers in louisville and shepherdsville kentucky 
we also rely upon certain vendors to ship products directly to customers on our behalf 
we act as principal in these transactions  as orders are initiated directly through the e commerce businesses that we operate  we take title to the goods at the shipping point and have the economic risk related to collection  customer care and returns 
we recognize revenue from shipping when products are shipped and title passes to the common carrier

 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  and believe that the payment of partner revenue share charges  or the issuance of warrants or stock in lieu of cash partner revenue share charges  to our partners should not result in any reduction of revenues

addresses consideration paid to parties along a distribution chain 
we purchase merchandise from our vendors  at our discretion  and we are responsible for paying those vendors 
the amounts purchased and the prices paid to our vendors are not impacted by the revenue share provisions of our agreements with our partners 
accordingly  our partners and our vendors are not linked in the distribution chain and we believe that the provisions of eitf no 
do not apply 
we recognize revenue from services provided as the services are rendered 
if we receive payments for services in advance  these amounts are deferred and then recognized over the service period 
deferred revenue consists primarily of fees paid to us in advance for service fees related to enhancements to our partners e commerce businesses which are recognized ratably over the service period and amounts received from the sale of gift certificates redeemable through our partners e commerce businesses which are recognized when the gift certificates are redeemed 
accounting for inventory inventory  primarily consisting of apparel  athletic equipment  consumer electronics  footware and licensed products is valued at the lower of cost determined using the weighted average method or market 
inherent in this valuation are significant management judgments and estimates  including among others  assessments concerning obsolescence and shrinkage rates 
based upon these judgments and estimates  which are applied consistently from period to period  we record valuation allowances to adjust the carrying amount of our inventory 
we record a charge for obsolescence based upon  among other factors  the amount of inventory which has an aging of greater than nine months and the anticipated mark downs required to sell the inventory in the normal course of business

accordingly  compensation expense for stock options and warrants issued to non employees is measured using a black scholes multiple option pricing model that takes into account significant assumptions as to the expected life of the option or warrant  the expected volatility of our common stock and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option or warrant 
we also record stock based compensation as deferred partner revenue share charges are amortized 
these deferred partner revenue share charges  which are included in other assets  have resulted from the exercise of a right to receive  shares of our common stock in lieu of future cash revenue share payments  and were million as of the end of fiscal and million as of the end of fiscal the deferred partner revenue share charges are currently amortized as the revenue share expense is incurred over the contract term of the partners agreement based on actual revenues recognized in a given period and the imputed partner revenue share percentage  which is based on the value of our common stock that was issued upon exercise of the right 
once certain revenue thresholds are achieved by the partner  the remaining partner revenue share charges will be amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the contract 
in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued financial accounting standards board statement no 
r share based payment  or sfas r  which replaces financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb under the provisions of sfas r  we are required to measure the cost of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  and to recognize that cost in the financial statements based on their fair values  beginning in fiscal in addition  sfas r will cause unrecognized expense based on the amounts in our pro forma footnote disclosure related to options vesting after the date of initial adoption to be recognized as a charge to results of operations over the remaining vesting period 
we will adopt sfas r in our first quarter of using the modified prospective approach for transitioning 
this approach requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and share awards at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for an analysis of the impact on our income statement of recognizing share based payments based on their fair value in accordance with sfas no

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest our excess cash in institutional money market accounts  auction rate certificates  us government agencies  corporate bonds and auction preferred stock 
in order to minimize risk and credit exposure  we invest with three financial institutions 
we protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or it may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates

despite the long term nature of their stated contractual maturities  there is a ready liquid market for these securities based on the interest reset mechanism 
all securities represent investments available for current corporate purposes and are  therefore  classified as a current asset
