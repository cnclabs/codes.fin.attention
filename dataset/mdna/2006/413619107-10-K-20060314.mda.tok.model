additional information about our casino entertainment properties as of december  is set forth below in item  properties 
sales and marketing we believe that our distribution system of casino entertainment facilities provides us the ability to generate play by our customers when they travel among markets  which we refer to as cross market play 
we believe our customer loyalty program  total rewards  in conjunction with this distribution system  allows us to capture a growing share of our customers gaming budget and generate increased same store sales 
by april  our total rewards customers will be able to earn reward credits and redeem those credits at all of our us casino entertainment facilities 
since december  we have been converting the systems to support the transition of caesars entertainment inc s connection card to total rewards at all of the us properties we acquired in the caesars acquisition 
we integrated the horseshoe properties into our total rewards database in  and by april  the winners circle card will be transitioned to total rewards

we have developed a database containing information for our customers and aspects of their casino gaming play 
we use this information for marketing promotions  including through direct mail campaigns and the use of electronic mail and our website

trademark rights are perpetual provided that the mark remains in use by us 
we consider all of these marks  and the associated name recognition  to be valuable to our business 
we have been issued five us patents covering some of the technology associated with our total rewards program us patent no

 issued june   expiring may   us patent no 
 issued september   expiring september   us patent no 
 issued december   expiring may   and us patent no 
 issued february   expiring may  in  we sued a competitor casino company in federal court seeking to enforce three of these patents 
in june  the trial court ruled against us on the competitor s motion for summary judgment  holding that the claims of patent nos 
 and  and portions of the claims of patent no 
 were invalid 
the appeals court affirmed the trial court s motion for summary judgment and we elected to not appeal this decision 
we do not believe that the ruling will adversely affect our business or operations 
competition we own or manage land based  dockside  riverboat and indian casino facilities in most us casino entertainment jurisdictions 
we also own or manage properties in canada and uruguay 
we compete with numerous casinos and casino hotels of varying quality and size in the market areas where our properties are located 
we also compete with other non gaming resorts and vacation areas  and with various other casino and other entertainment businesses 
the casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably by their size  quality of facilities  number of operations  brand identities  marketing and growth strategies  financial strength and capabilities  level of amenities  management talent and geographic diversity 
in most markets  we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas 
in some markets  we face competition from nearby markets in addition to direct competition within our market areas 
in recent years  with fewer new markets opening for development  competition in existing markets has intensified 
many casino operators  including us  have invested in expanding existing facilities  developing new facilities  and acquiring established facilities in existing markets  such as our acquisition of the casinos owned by rio  showboat  players  harveys  horseshoe  caesars and imperial palace 
this expansion of existing casino entertainment properties  the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors has increased competition in many markets in which we compete  and this intense competition can be expected to continue 
we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of any further legalization of casino gaming in the us and abroad  the continued positive consumer acceptance of casino gaming as an entertainment activity  and increased visitation to casino facilities 
however  the expansion of casino entertainment into new markets  such as the recent expansion of tribal casino opportunities in new york and california and the approval of gaming facilities in pennsylvania and florida  could also present competitive issues for us 
at this time  the ultimate impact that these events may have on the industry and on us is uncertain 
the casino entertainment industry is also subject to political and regulatory uncertainty 
see also part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effects of current economic and political conditions and portions of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overall operating results and regional results and development plans 
governmental regulation the gaming industry is highly regulated  and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations 
each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws  rules and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is located 
these laws  rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility  financial stability and character of the owners  managers  and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations 
violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions 
a more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in exhibit to this annual report on form k  which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference 
our businesses are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations 
these laws and regulations include  but are not limited to  restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages  environmental matters  employees  currency transactions  taxation  zoning and building codes  and marketing and advertising 
such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future  or new laws and regulations could be enacted 
material changes  new laws or regulations  or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results 
employee relations we have approximately  employees through our various subsidiaries 
despite a strike in atlantic city in that was settled  we consider our labor relations with employees to be good 
approximately  employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with certain of our subsidiaries  relating to certain casino  hotel and restaurant employees at certain of our properties 
most of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements are located at our properties in las vegas and atlantic city

item a 
risk factors 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and taxation policies  the enforcement of which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive gaming regulations and political and regulatory uncertainty 
regulatory authorities in the foreign countries that we operate  as well as at the us federal  state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke  suspend  condition or limit our gaming or other licenses  impose substantial fines and take other actions  any one of which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  individual jurisdictions have also considered legislation or referendums  such as bans on smoking in casinos and other entertainment and dining facilities  which could adversely impact our operations 
the likelihood or outcome of similar legislation and referendums in the future cannot be predicted 
the casino entertainment industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to the various jurisdictions in which casinos operate 
from time to time  various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  including increases in tax rates  which would affect the industry 
if adopted  such changes could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the development and construction of new hotels  casinos and gaming venues and the expansion of existing ones are susceptible to delays  cost overruns and other uncertainties  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may decide to develop  construct and open new hotels  casinos and other gaming venues in response to opportunities that may arise  including developments in singapore  slovenia  spain  pennsylvania and the bahamas previously disclosed 
future development projects and acquisitions may require significant capital commitments and could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  guarantees of third party debt  the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets  which could have an adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the development and construction of new hotels  casinos and gaming venues and the expansion of existing ones  such as our expansions at our harrah s atlantic city and harrah s new orleans properties  are susceptible to various risks and uncertainties  such as the existence of acceptable market conditions and demand for the completed project  general construction risks  including cost overruns  change orders and plan or specification modification  shortages of equipment  materials or skilled labor  labor disputes  unforeseen environmental  engineering or geological problems  work stoppages  fire and other natural disasters  construction scheduling problems and weather interferences  changes and concessions required by governmental or regulatory authorities  delays in obtaining  or inability to obtain  all licenses  permits and authorizations required to complete and or operate the project  and disruption of our existing operations and facilities 
our failure to complete any new development or expansion project as planned  on schedule  within budget or in a manner that generates anticipated profits  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash  and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
harrah s entertainment  inc is a holding company and harrah s operating company  inc conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries 
as a result  our ability to meet our debt service obligations substantially depends upon our subsidiaries cash flows and payments of funds to us by our subsidiaries 
this ability  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
an economic downturn in a region in which we operate may adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
based on our current level of operations and recent acquisitions  including the acquisition of caesars  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurances  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
acts of terrorism and war and natural disasters may negatively impact our future profits 
terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties 
we cannot predict the extent to which terrorism  security alerts or war  or hostilities in iraq will continue to directly or indirectly impact our business and operating results 
as a consequence of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future  premiums for a variety of insurance products have increased  and some types of insurance are no longer available 
given current conditions in the global insurance markets  we are predominately uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
if any such event were to affect our properties  we would likely be adversely impacted 
in addition  natural disasters such as major fires  floods  hurricanes and earthquakes could also adversely impact our business and operating results 
for example  four of our properties were closed due to the damage sustained from hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september such events could lead to the loss of use of one or more of our properties for an extended period of time and disrupt our ability to attract customers to certain of our gaming facilities 
if any such event were to affect our properties  we would likely be adversely impacted 
in most cases  we have insurance that covers portions of any losses from a natural disaster  but it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts in many cases 
although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster  the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds  if any  is out of our control 
additionally  a natural disaster affecting one or more of our properties may affect the level and cost of insurance coverage we may be able to obtain in the future  which may adversely affect our financial position 
work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits 
some of our employees are represented by labor unions 
a lengthy strike or other work stoppage at one of our casino properties or construction projects could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
from time to time  we have also experienced attempts to unionize certain of our non union employees 
while these efforts have achieved only limited success to date  we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and more successful union activity in the future 
we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of caesars 
our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of caesars will depend  in part  on our ability to integrate the businesses of caesars with our businesses 
the combination of two independent companies is a complex  costly and time consuming process 
this process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies  and may not result in the full benefits expected 
the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include  among others coordinating marketing functions  unanticipated issues in integrating information  communications and other systems  unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing  logistics  marketing and administration methods  retaining key employees  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures  the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns  and coordinating geographically separate organizations 
there is no assurance that our acquisition of caesars will realize the full benefits anticipated 
the risks associated with our international operations could reduce our profits 
some of our properties are located in countries outside the united states 
additionally  we have announced intentions to build additional facilities outside the united states 
international operations are subject to inherent risks including variation in local economies  currency fluctuation  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  trade barriers  burden of complying with a variety of international laws  and political and economic instability 
if we are unable to effectively compete against our competitors  our profits will decline 
the gaming industry is highly competitive and our competitors vary considerably by their size  quality of facilities  number of operations  brand identities  marketing and growth strategies  financial strength and capabilities  level of amenities  management talent and geographic diversity 
we also compete with other non gaming resorts and vacation areas  and with various other entertainment businesses 
in recent years  with fewer new markets opening for development  competition in existing markets has intensified 
the expansion of existing casino entertainment properties  the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we operate  and this intense competition is expected to continue 
these competitive pressures have and are expected to continue to adversely affect our financial performance in certain markets 
in particular  our business may be adversely impacted by the additional gaming and room capacity in nevada  new jersey  mississippi  missouri  michigan  indiana  iowa  illinois  pennsylvania  louisiana  canada  spain  uruguay  singapore  slovenia  bahamas and or other projects not yet announced in any of the other markets in which we operate or intend to operate 
in addition  our operations located in new jersey and nevada may be adversely impacted by the expansion of native american gaming in new york and california

in april  the saint regis mohawk tribe the tribe granted caesars the exclusive rights to develop a casino project in the state of new york 
on april   certain individual members of the tribe purported to commence a class action proceeding in a tribal court in hogansburg  new york  against caesars seeking to nullify caesars agreement with the tribe 
on march   the tribal court purported to render a default judgment against caesars in the amount of billion 
three cases resulted from this tribal court judgment on june   caesars filed an action captioned park place entertainment corporation  et al 
vs 
arquette  et al  in the united states district court for the northern district of new york seeking to enjoin the dissident tribal members from proceeding in the tribal court  and to challenge the judgment 
the district court entered an order on july  and a subsequent order on february   affirming that the purported tribal court is without authority to adjudicate matters of tribal law 
on march   caesars sued the dissident tribal members in the supreme court of the state of new york subsequently moved to franklin county  new york in the case of park place entertainment corporation  et al 
vs 
marlene arquette  et al  alleging malicious defamation and prima facie tort in connection with the tribal court proceedings seeking compensatory and punitive damages 
defendants asserted a counterclaim alleging the action was commenced in violation of new york s civil rights law 
on june   certain individual members of the tribe commenced an action in united states district court for the northern district of new york against caesars  seeking recognition and enforcement of the purported march   billion tribal court default judgment 
caesars has taken the position that the purported tribal court in which the proceeding has been invoked is an invalid forum and is not recognized by the lawful government of the saint regis mohawk tribe 
prior to our acquisition of caesars in june  each of the above matters was settled  pending final court approval and execution of documents and mutual releases 
on november   catskill development  llc  mohawk management  llc and monticello raceway development company  llc collectively  catskill development filed an action captioned catskill development llc  et al 
vs 
park place entertainment corporation  et al  against caesars in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
catskill development alleges tortious interference with contract and prospective business relationships  unfair competition and state anti trust violations pertaining to a proposed gaming facility to be developed by catskill development and the tribe  and seeks over billion in compensatory damages and over billion in punitive damages 
the district court granted summary judgment to caesars and dismissed the complaint in its entirety 
the plaintiffs appealed the district court s decision to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit  where it is currently waiting a decision 
the company believes this matter to be without merit and will continue to vigorously contest the case 
on october   scutti enterprises  llc scutti filed an action against caesars in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of monroe subsequently removed to united states district court for the western district of new york 
the action arises out of scutti s efforts to redevelop and manage the tribe s mohawk bingo palace 
scutti alleges tortious interference with contract and prospective business relationships  unfair competition and state anti trust violations and seeks over million in compensatory damages and unspecified punitive damages 
the district court entered summary judgment  in caesars favor  on all of the claims 
currently  the matter is before the united states court of appeals for the second circuit related solely to the claim for tortuous interference with prospective business relations 
the company believes this matter to be without merit and will continue to vigorously contest this matter 
in addition  the company is party to ordinary and routine litigation incidental to our business

overview was a transformational year for harrah s entertainment as we consummated our acquisition of caesars entertainment  inc caesars on june   and became the world s largest provider of branded casino entertainment 
as a larger company  our strategy is to focus on exploiting the value of our five major brands harrah s  caesars  horseshoe  total rewards and the world series of poker 
as we study markets in which we operate  or may operate  we will brand casinos tailored to customers in each market 
we are already using our most internationally recognized brand  caesars  in development plans for several integrated resorts in international jurisdictions 
we believe that the customer relationship marketing and business intelligence capabilities fueled by total rewards  our customer loyalty program  are constantly bringing us closer to our customers so we better understand their preferences  and from that understanding  we are able to improve entertainment experiences we offer accordingly 
certain events that affected our results  or that may affect future results  are listed below 
these items are discussed in greater detail elsewhere in our discussion of operating results and in the debt and liquidity section 
on june   we completed our acquisition of caesars  adding properties to our portfolio 
the purchase price allocation process began in june and will be completed within one year of the date of the acquisition 
the results of the caesars properties are included with our operating results subsequent to their acquisition 
we immediately began the integration and conversion of systems  customer databases and operations in order to achieve synergies and increase market share and visitation

our assets in new orleans also sustained damage  and we suffered various losses as a result of hurricane katrina 
then on september   hurricane rita hit the gulf coast  causing significant damage to our assets in lake charles  louisiana 
at december   all four properties remained closed 
on april   we sold the assets and certain related liabilities of harrah s east chicago and harrah s tunica to an unrelated third party 
results for harrah s east chicago and harrah s tunica are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
we reported a pretax gain of approximately million on the sale of these two properties in the second quarter of charges of million were taken in fourth quarter to write off the goodwill and other intangible assets for harrah s lake charles  harrah s louisiana downs  grand casino biloxi and grand casino gulfport

charges of million for premiums paid and the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to the senior notes were charged to income from continuing operations 
on december   we acquired the assets of the imperial palace hotel casino imperial palace in las vegas  nevada 
the imperial palace occupies an acre site on the las vegas strip that is situated between harrah s las vegas and the flamingo and is across the strip from caesars palace 
this acquisition is one of a number of moves designed to strategically position the company for development in las vegas

the discussion that follows is related to our continuing operations 
percentage increase decrease in millions  except earnings per share vs vs casino revenues total revenues income from operations income from continuing operations net income earnings per share diluted from continuing operations net income operating margin pts pt included results from properties acquired in the caesars acquisition subsequent to june   and a full year s results from properties acquired from horseshoe gaming holding corp 
horseshoe gaming on july  caesars properties contributed billion in revenues and million in income from operations in the approximate six months that we owned them in the properties acquired from horseshoe gaming contributed million in revenues and million in income from operations in vs 
million in revenues and million in income from operations in the six months that we owned them in results were also affected by the loss of revenues and income from operations from four properties closed due to hurricane damage 
excluding results from properties acquired from caesars and horseshoe gaming and from properties closed due to hurricane damage  revenues were higher than in  however  income from operations and net income were lower due to a charge in for impairment of intangible assets 
in  total revenues increased for the seventh consecutive year and were higher than in  primarily as a result of the acquisition of horseshoe gaming on july   strong results from our properties in southern nevada and organic growth at most of our properties 
we define organic growth as year over year increase in gaming revenues for properties that we have owned and operated for both periods 
our income from operations was higher than in  driven by increased revenues and lower gaming taxes at our bluffs run property as a result of legislation that settled an issue related to gaming taxes for casinos at racetracks 
net income increased and diluted earnings per share increased over our results 
hurricane damage grand casino biloxi and grand casino gulfport on august   hurricane katrina hit the gulf coast  causing significant damage to our assets in biloxi and gulfport  mississippi 
we plan to rebuild in biloxi  but at this time we are unable to determine the amount of time needed to reconstruct the damaged assets 
in december  we reached an agreement to sell the gulfport assets in their as is condition 
harrah s entertainment will retain all insurance proceeds related to the gulfport property 
insurance covers the repair or replacement of our assets that suffered loss or damages 
the deductible under these policies is million 
we are working closely with our insurance carriers and claims adjusters to ascertain the full amount of insurance proceeds due to us as a result of the damages and losses 
based on current estimates  insurance proceeds are expected to equal or exceed the net book value of the impacted assets  therefore  we do not expect to record a loss after insurance recoveries 
our insurance policies also provide coverage for interruption to our business  including lost profits  and reimbursement for other expenses and costs we have incurred relating to the damages and losses suffered 
due to our expectation that the costs incurred in the aftermath of the storm will be less than the anticipated business interruption insurance proceeds  post storm costs are being offset by the expected recovery  and there is no current income statement impact 
to the extent that business interruption proceeds ultimately exceed the costs incurred  the excess is expected to be recorded as income in the line item  write downs  reserves and recoveries 
we have written off property and inventories that were destroyed by hurricane katrina and recorded receivables in anticipation of insurance proceeds that will reimburse us for those losses and for expenses that we expect to recover under our insurance programs 
as of december   we had received approximately million in advances from our insurance carriers related to the mississippi gulf coast properties and had net receivables of million for which we believe collection is probable 
intangible assets of million related to grand casino biloxi and million related to grand casino gulfport were written off in the fourth quarter of harrah s new orleans our assets in new orleans sustained damage  and we suffered various losses as a result of hurricane katrina 
at december   the casino remained closed  but the property reopened on february  insurance covers the repair or replacement of our assets that suffered loss or damage  and we are working closely with our insurance carriers and claims adjusters to ascertain the full amount of insurance proceeds due to us as a result of the damages and the loss the company suffered 
our insurance policies also provide coverage for interruption to our business  including lost profits  and reimbursement for other expenses and costs that we have incurred relating to the damages and loss we have suffered 
the combined property damage and business interruption deductible under the policies insuring the new orleans assets is million 
based on loss estimates and expenses incurred  we have recorded million in charges in the line item  write downs  reserves and recoveries 
as of december   approximately million in advances had been received from our insurance carriers  and we had net receivables of million for which we believe collection is probable 
a room luxury hotel that is under construction adjacent to the casino facility also sustained damage due to hurricane katrina 
we have a separate builders risk insurance policy that covers costs associated with repairing any damage 
the deductible under this policy is  we recorded a charge of  in the third quarter in the line item  write downs  reserves and recoveries 
the time required to resume construction  as well as the increased demands for construction labor and materials in the market  could cause the cost of the construction to increase and the time to complete the construction to be extended 
construction resumed in fourth quarter  and we expect the hotel to open in third quarter harrah s lake charles on september   hurricane rita hit the gulf coast  causing significant damage to our assets in lake charles  louisiana 
insurance covers the repair or replacement of our assets that suffered loss or damage and provides coverage for interruption to our business  including lost profits 
the deductible of million under the policies that cover our damages and losses in lake charles applies both to physical damage and to business interruption 
based on estimates to date  losses have exceeded the deductible under this insurance policy  and we recorded million in charges related to lake charles in the line item  write downs  reserves and recoveries 
we have written off property and inventories that were destroyed by hurricane rita and recorded receivables in anticipation of insurance proceeds that will reimburse us for those losses and for expenses that we expect to recover under our insurance programs 
as of december   approximately million in advances had been received from our insurance carriers  and we had net receivables of million for which we believe collection is probable 
in our review of goodwill and other intangible assets completed during fourth quarter  we determined that the entire million of goodwill carried at lake charles was impaired  and it was written off 
regional results and development plans the executive decision makers of our company review operating results  assess performance and make decisions related to the allocation of resources on a property by property basis 
we  therefore  consider each property to be an operating segment and that it is appropriate to aggregate and present the operations of our company as one reportable segment

operating results for the las vegas horseshoe were consolidated with our results from april   until march   however  those results were not material to our operating results 
construction was completed in august on a room  story hotel tower and convention center at caesars palace

revenue gains were seen in the second half of at our north kansas city property due to recent capital investments  including a million expansion and property enhancement project that added a room hotel addition in august and new restaurants and other amenities in the fourth quarter of income from operations was affected by the competitive promotional environment in the st 
louis market and construction disruptions at harrah s north kansas city

casinos at racetracks in iowa historically had been taxed at a higher rate in than the casinos on riverboats operating in iowa 
the iowa supreme court issued an opinion in june that this disparity was unconstitutional 
the state appealed the iowa supreme court s decision to the united states supreme court and in june  the united states supreme court overturned the ruling and remanded the case back to the iowa supreme court for further consideration 
in february  the iowa supreme court ruled that the disparity violates the iowa constitution  a ruling the state appealed to the united states supreme court in april the united states supreme court declined to hear this case 
in april  the iowa legislature passed legislation to effectively settle the issues regarding the gaming tax rates 
the new legislation provides for a tax rate of for both riverboats and racetracks effective july  however  racetracks have the option to conduct table games and video games that simulate table games by paying a million fee to the state and a gaming tax rate of 
twenty percent of the million fee could be used to offset wagering taxes for each of the five fiscal years beginning july  we plan to add table games to the bluffs run facility in conjunction with the rebranding  renovation and expansion of that facility see discussion below  and in second quarter  we paid the million fee to the state 
in accordance with previous agreements and as additional purchase price consideration  a payment of approximately million was made to iowa west racing association iowa west  the entity holding the pari mutuel and gaming license for the bluffs run casino and with whom we have a management agreement to operate that property 
the additional payment to iowa west increased goodwill attributed to the bluffs run property 
the payment to iowa west assumed we will operate table games at bluffs run and pay a tax rate  however  iowa west took the position that the purchase price adjustment should be based on a tax rate of  which would result in an additional million payment to iowa west 
the dispute was resolved by arbitration in third quarter  and the arbitrators decided on a tax rate

south central caesars properties contributed million in revenues and losses from operations of million in excluding results from the properties acquired from caesars  revenues for our south central properties increased from last year  but income from operations was below last year driven by fourth quarter charges for the impairment of goodwill  the effects of hurricanes katrina and rita on our louisiana properties and loss of results of harrah s shreveport  which was sold in second quarter partially offsetting these declines were a full year s results from horseshoe bossier city and horseshoe tunica  which were acquired on july   and higher results from harrah s louisiana downs  where the permanent facility opened in second quarter with  slot machines compared to the that were in service prior to that time 
construction began in second quarter on a story  room  million hotel tower at harrah s new orleans  which also sustained damage due to hurricane katrina 
the property does not currently operate a hotel  although it does utilize rooms at third party hotels 
the additional time required to complete construction  as well as the increased demands for construction labor and materials in the market  could cause the cost of the construction to increase 
construction resumed in fourth quarter  and we expect the hotel to open in third quarter at this time  we are unable to estimate the additional costs  if any  to complete construction 
as of december   million had been spent on this project 
combined revenues and income from operations were higher by and  respectively  than in due to results from horseshoe bossier city and horseshoe tunica subsequent to their july   acquisition and increased revenues from harrah s louisiana downs  harrah s new orleans and harrah s lake charles and partially offset by the loss of revenues in due to the sale of harrah s shreveport

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and our analysis indicated that the carrying value of the tangible assets was not impaired 
since our acquisition of the lake charles property  competition had intensified in the market and the operating performance was declining 
as a result of the operating trends  compounded by the impact of hurricane damage in september  our annual assessment for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets indicated that the entire million of goodwill was impaired

the loss from operations in was primarily due to development costs  which were higher than in due to increased development activities in many jurisdictions  including international jurisdictions  considering allowing development and operation of casinos or casino like operations 
in  we dissolved the joint venture formed in with gala group  a united kingdom uk based gaming operator  to develop regional casinos in the uk in response to the uk government s proposal to restrict development of regional casinos 
we will focus on opportunities to develop large scale destination casino resorts with more than  square feet of gaming space  as well as hotel rooms  restaurants and entertainment venues see our discussion below of development of new projects 
development costs for were lower than in due to changes in or timing of development activities in jurisdictions  including rhode island  pennsylvania and the united kingdom  that are considering allowing development and operation of casinos or casino like operations

the purchase price allocation will be finalized within one year of the date of the acquisition and estimated amounts are subject to adjustments  which could be material  during that period 
amortization of intangible assets acquired from horseshoe gaming on july   also contributed to the increases for and interest expense increased in from due to increased borrowings related to our acquisitions of caesars and horseshoe gaming and to higher interest rates on our variable rate debt 
the average interest rate on our variable rate debt  excluding the impact of our swap agreements  was at december   compared to at december  a change in interest rates will impact our financial results

strategic acquisitions in the three year period ended december   we acquired two casino companies  a casino in las vegas  nevada  and certain intellectual property rights 
for each of these acquisitions  the purchase price is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we determine the estimated fair values based on independent appraisals  discounted cash flows  quoted market prices and estimates made by management 
for each transaction  the allocation of the purchase price was  or will be  completed within one year from the date of the acquisition 
to the extent that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  such excess is allocated to goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite life are not amortized

this acquisition is one of a number of moves designed to strategically position the company for development in las vegas 
the results for imperial palace are included in our operating results subsequent to its acquisition on december  at december   we assumed that the excess of the purchase price over the net book value of the assets acquired is incremental land cost 
values assigned to assets will be revised upon the finalization of valuation reports from independent appraisals 
the purchase price allocation will be completed within one year of the acquisition 
caesars entertainment on june   we completed our acquisition of percent of the outstanding shares of caesars 
under the terms of the agreement  caesars stockholders were to receive either in cash or shares of harrah s entertainment s common stock for each outstanding share of caesars common stock  subject to limitations on the aggregate amount of cash to be paid and shares of stock to be issued

see hurricane damage for a discussion of recent hurricanes at two of the properties acquired from caesars 
the results of the caesars properties are included with our operating results subsequent to their acquisition on june  depreciation and amortization related to the caesars acquisition is estimated based on our preliminary purchase price allocation 
estimated useful lives and amortization periods of property  equipment and intangible assets are being determined during the purchase price allocation and will be adjusted accordingly 
in may  caesars reached an agreement to sell the reno hilton  and that sale  which is subject to regulatory approvals  is expected to close in second quarter also included in the caesars acquisition were the flamingo laughlin casino and a hotel in halifax  nova scotia  that we determined to classify as assets held for sale in our financial statements

we reached an agreement in november  to sell flamingo laughlin 
the sale of flamingo laughlin is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close by mid no gain or loss is expected on these sales

these costs are reflected in merger and integration costs for caesars acquisition in our consolidated statements of income 
the purchase price allocation is in process and will be completed within one year of the acquisition  thus  the allocation of the purchase price is subject to refinement 
we are continuing our review of the information provided to us by the third parties engaged to perform the valuation studies and have asked for additional information that is necessary for us to finalize the purchase price allocation 
this information includes additional support for the valuation of land in the las vegas market and for the values assigned to acquired customer relationships 
we are also working with internal and external legal counsel to finalize the assessments of the exposures we assumed for certain contingent liabilities 
our preliminary purchase price allocation also assumes that certain assets  identified for probable replacement prior to the consummation of the acquisition  will be removed from service  which impacts the fair value and useful lives assigned to these assets 
the decision to remove these assets from service is subject to final approval by the board of directors 
should the determination be made prior to the finalization of the purchase price allocation that these assets will remain in service  the purchase price allocation will be adjusted accordingly 
for purposes of these financial statements  the purchase price allocation is based on the best estimates available of fair values and useful lives for the affected assets

we paid approximately million for the intellectual property assets  including assumption and subsequent payment of certain liabilities of las vegas horseshoe which included certain amounts payable to a principal of horseshoe gaming and approximately million of acquisition costs 
the intangible assets acquired in this transaction have been deemed to have indefinite lives and  therefore  are not being amortized 
we financed the acquisition with funds from various sources  including cash flows from operations and borrowings from established debt programs 
harrah s shreveport and louisiana downs buyout of minority partners in the first quarter of  we paid approximately million to the minority owners of the company that owned louisiana downs and harrah s shreveport to purchase their ownership interest in that company

these cash flows reflect the impact on our consolidated operations of the success of our marketing programs  our strategic acquisitions  on going cost containment focus and favorable variable interest rates 
for  we reported cash flows from operating activities of million  a decrease from the million reported in the decrease is due to the use of funds for payment of current liabilities assumed in our acquisition of caesars  including income taxes of approximately million and interest of approximately million

debt assumed in acquisition of caesars the following debt was assumed in our acquisition of caesars 
in millions face amount senior subordinated notes  due senior notes  due senior notes  due senior notes  due senior subordinated notes  due senior subordinated notes  due senior subordinated notes  due senior subordinated notes  due floating rate contingent convertible senior notes  due other total we recorded the above debt at its market value  which  at june   was  million  including interest rate swap agreements  which are discussed below 
the premium recorded is being amortized as a credit to interest expense using the effective interest method 
the debt was assumed by harrah s operating company  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of harrah s entertainment  and is guaranteed by harrah s entertainment 
in fourth quarter  the senior subordinated notes  due  were retired 
credit agreement as of december   our credit facilities the credit agreement provided for up to billion in borrowings  maturing on april  the credit agreement also contains a provision that will allow a further increase in the borrowing capacity to billion  if mutually acceptable to the company and the lenders 
interest on the credit agreement is based on our debt ratings and leverage ratio and is subject to change 
as of december   the credit agreement bore interest based upon basis points over libor and bore a facility fee for borrowed and unborrowed amounts of basis points  a combined basis points 
at our option  we may borrow at the prime rate under the credit agreement 
as of december   billion in borrowings was outstanding under the credit agreement with an additional million committed to back letters of credit 
after consideration of these borrowings  but before consideration of amounts borrowed under the commercial paper program  billion of additional borrowing capacity was available to the company as of december  contingent convertible senior notes included in the debt assumed in the caesars acquisition is million floating rate contingent convertible senior notes due the notes bear interest at an annual rate equal to the three month libor  adjusted quarterly 
the interest rate on these notes was at december  the notes are convertible into cash and shares of common stock in the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter  if the closing sale price of the company s common stock for out of the last consecutive trading days during the previous quarter is more than of the conversion price of the notes  the company has called the notes for redemption and the redemption has not yet occurred  during the five trading day period immediately after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the notes per  principal amount for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of the company s common stock on such day multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion  provided that  if on such date  the common stock price is between the conversion price and of the conversion price  as defined  then the holders will receive the principal amount of the notes surrendered plus accrued but unpaid interest  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions as defined in the indenture covering these notes 
holders may convert any outstanding notes into cash and shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price per share of the conversion price at december  this represents a conversion rate of approximately shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes the conversion rate 
subject to certain exceptions described in the indenture covering these notes  at the time the notes are tendered for conversion the value the conversion value of the cash and shares of the company s common stock  if any  to be received by a holder converting  principal amount of the notes will be determined by multiplying the conversion rate by the ten day average closing stock price  which equals the average of the closing per share prices of the company s common stock on the new york stock exchange on the ten consecutive trading days beginning on the second trading day following the day the notes are submitted for conversion 
the conversion value will be delivered to holders as follows an amount in cash the principal return equal to the lesser of a the aggregate conversion value of the notes to be converted and b the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted  and if the aggregate conversion value of the notes to be converted is greater than the principal return  any amount in shares the net shares equal to the aggregate conversion value less the principal return the net share amount 
the company will pay the principal return and deliver the net shares  if any  as promptly as practicable after determination of the net share amount 
the number of net shares to be paid will be determined by dividing the net share amount by the ten day average closing stock price 
the conversion price will decrease when cash dividends are declared so that the conversion price will equal the price determined by multiplying the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the record date for such dividend by a fraction  i the numerator of which shall be the average of the pre dividend sale price  as defined in the agreement  minus the amount of the cash dividend  and ii the denominator of which shall be the pre dividend sale price 
as a result of the third and fourth quarter cash dividends  the conversion price had been adjusted from at the time of our acquisition of caesars to at december  the notes are redeemable by the company at any time on or after april   at percent of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders may require the company to purchase all or a portion of these notes on april    or at percent of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the notes are unsecured obligations  rank equal with our other senior indebtedness and are senior to all of our subordinated indebtedness 
derivative instruments we account for derivative instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and all amendments thereto 
sfas no 
requires that all derivative instruments be recognized in the financial statements at fair value 
any changes in fair value are recorded in the income statement or in other comprehensive income  depending on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting  the type of hedge transaction and the effectiveness of the hedge 
the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are based on market prices obtained from dealer quotes 
such quotes represent the estimated amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts 
our derivative instruments contain a credit risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
we minimize that risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of our counterparties  which are limited to major banks and financial institutions  and we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 
interest rate swap agreements we use interest rate swaps to manage the mix of our debt between fixed and variable rate instruments 
as of december   we were a party to five interest rate swaps  including four assumed in the caesars acquisition  for a total notional amount of million 
these interest rate swaps serve to manage the mix of our debt between fixed and variable rate instruments by effectively converting fixed rates associated with long term debt obligations to floating rates 
the major terms of the interest rate swaps are as follows 
swap effective date notional amount fixed rate received variable rate paid as of dec

 assumed in our acquisition of caesars 
the variable rates on the swaps acquired from caesars are set in arrears and are estimated at december   based on a forward libor rate 
the company s original interest rate swap qualifies for the shortcut method allowed under sfas no 
 which allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness 
the interest rate swaps assumed in our acquisition of caesars do not qualify for the shortcut method  however  they had been determined to be highly effective since inception 
in our fourth quarter assessment  we determined that these interest rate swaps were no longer highly effective 
we discontinued hedge accounting as of october  as a result  a million charge was recorded to interest expense in fourth quarter to record the change in fair value of these instruments 
the fair value adjustments to the hedged item of million continue to be reported as a part of the basis of debt and are being amortized as a credit to interest expense over the life of the debt 
the income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments for our swap agreements was not material during any of the other periods reported 
the net effect of the above swaps increased our interest expense by million 
our interest expense was reduced by million by the net effect of our four interest rate swaps in effect during as of december  and  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a net liability of approximately million and million  respectively  which is included in deferred credits and other on our consolidated balance sheets 
in february  we paid approximately million to terminate million of the interest rate swaps  which represented the fair value of the swaps on the date of termination 
because the interest rate swaps no longer qualified for hedge accounting  this amount will be recognized in earnings as interest expense in the first quarter of treasury rate lock agreements in anticipation of issuing new debt in  we entered into agreements in and to lock in existing ten year rates to partially hedge the risk of future increases to the treasury rate 
we determined that the treasury rate lock agreements qualified for hedge accounting and were perfectly effective 
as such  there was no income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments 
the fair values of our treasury rate lock agreements were carried as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  and changes in the fair values were recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and are being reclassified to earnings over the life of the debt to be issued 
the amount that is expected to be reclassified to earnings within the next months is not material 
the net amount of deferred gains included in other comprehensive income at december  and  is million and million  respectively 
in may  we issued million of senior notes due  and the treasury rate lock agreements were terminated 
the treasury locks and discount premium at issuance resulted in an effective rate of on this debt 
commercial paper to provide the company with cost effective borrowing flexibility  we have a million commercial paper program that is used to borrow funds for general corporate purposes 
although the debt instruments are short term in tenor  they are classified as long term debt because the commercial paper is backed by our credit agreement and we have committed to keep available capacity under our credit agreement in an amount equal to or greater than amounts borrowed under this program 
at december   million was outstanding under this program 
issuance of new debt in addition to our credit agreement  we have issued debt and entered into credit agreements to provide the company with cost effective borrowing flexibility and to replace short term  floating rate debt with long term  fixed rate debt

these repurchases will be funded through available cash from operations and borrowings from our established debt programs 
such repurchases will depend on prevailing market conditions  the company s liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
charges of million in and million in  representing premiums paid and write offs of unamortized deferred financing costs and market value premiums associated with the early retirement of portions of the senior subordinated notes and of our previous credit and letter of credit facilities were recorded 
these charges are included in income from continuing operations in our consolidated statements of income 
equity repurchase programs our board of directors has authorized the purchase of up to million shares of common stock in the open market and negotiated purchases through the end of the repurchases are to be funded through available operating cash flows and borrowings from our established debt programs 
no shares were purchased in  however  million shares were purchased in at an average price of per share and million shares were purchased in at an average price of per share under previously approved equity repurchase programs 
guarantees of third party debt and other obligations and commitments the following tables summarize our contractual obligations and other commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in millions debt capital lease obligations estimated interest payments a operating lease obligations purchase orders obligations guaranteed payments to state of louisiana community reinvestment construction commitments entertainment obligations other contractual obligations a estimated interest for variable rate debt is based on rates at december  amount of commitment expiration per period other commitments total amounts committed less than year years years after years in millions guarantees of loans letters of credit minimum payments to tribes the agreements pursuant to which we manage casinos on indian lands contain provisions required by law that provide that a minimum monthly payment be made to the tribe 
that obligation has priority over scheduled repayments of borrowings for development costs and over the management fee earned and paid to the manager 
in the event that insufficient cash flow is generated by the operations to fund this payment  we must pay the shortfall to the tribe 
subject to certain limitations as to time  such advances  if any  would be repaid to us in future periods in which operations generate cash flow in excess of the required minimum payment 
these commitments will terminate upon the occurrence of certain defined events  including termination of the management contract 
our aggregate monthly commitment for the minimum guaranteed payments pursuant to the contracts for the four managed indian owned facilities now open  which extend for periods of up to months from december   is million 
each of these casinos currently generates sufficient cash flows to cover all of their obligations  including their debt service 
we may guarantee all or part of the debt incurred by indian tribes with which we have entered a management contract to fund development of casinos on the indian lands 
for all existing guarantees of indian debt  we have obtained a first lien on certain personal property tangible and intangible of the casino enterprise 
there can be no assurance  however  that the value of such property would satisfy our obligations in the event these guarantees were enforced 
additionally  we have received limited waivers from the indian tribes of their sovereign immunity to allow us to pursue our rights under the contracts between the parties and to enforce collection efforts as to any assets in which a security interest is taken 
the aggregate outstanding balance of such debt as of december   was million 
some of our guarantees of the debt for casinos on indian lands were modified during  triggering the requirement under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  to recognize a liability for the estimated fair value of those guarantees 
liabilities  representing the fair value of our guarantees  and corresponding assets  representing the portion of our management fee receivable attributable to our agreements to provide the related guarantees  were recorded and are being amortized over the lives of the related agreements 
we estimate the fair value of the obligation by considering what premium would have been required by us or by an unrelated party 
the amounts recognized represent the present value of the premium in interest rates and fees that would have been charged to the tribes if we had not provided the guarantees 
the balance of the liability for the guarantees and of the related assets at december  and  was million and million  respectively

slovenia we have signed a memorandum of understanding with the hit group  a slovenian company that operates nine casinos  to build a casino and hotel in nova gorica  slovenia  a resort city located along the border with italy 
appropriate governmental approvals and changes in certain laws are required to move forward with this project 
the bahamas we have signed a letter of intent with baha mar resorts  ltd 
and starwood hotels resorts worldwide  inc to create the caribbean s largest single phase destination in the bahamas 
we expect to develop and operate a caesars branded casino and hotel within the project 
competitive pressures due to the limited number of new markets opening for development in recent years  many casino operators are reinvesting in existing markets to attract new customers or gain market share  thereby increasing competition in those markets 
as companies have completed expansion projects  supply has typically grown at a faster pace than demand in some markets and competition has increased significantly 
furthermore  several operators  including harrah s entertainment  have announced plans for additional developments or expansions in some markets 
several states and indian tribes are also considering enabling the development and operation of casinos or casino like operations in their jurisdictions 
although the short term effect of such competitive developments on our company generally has been negative  we are not able to determine the long term impact  whether favorable or unfavorable  that these trends and events will have on current or future markets 
we believe that the geographic diversity of our operations  our focus on multi market customer relationships  our service training  our rewards and customer loyalty programs  and our continuing efforts to establish our brands as premier brands upon which we have built strong customer loyalty have well positioned us to face the challenges present within our industry 
we utilize the capabilities of winet  a sophisticated nationwide customer database  and total rewards  a nationwide loyalty program that allows our customers to earn cash  comps and other benefits for playing at harrah s entertainment casinos 
we believe these sophisticated marketing tools provide us with competitive advantages  particularly with players who visit more than one casino or market 
significant accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of our accounting policies  including the estimated lives assigned to our assets  the determination of bad debt  asset impairment  fair value of self insurance reserves and the calculation of our income tax liabilities  require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from our estimates 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be those in which our policies  estimates and judgments have a significant impact on issues that are inherently uncertain 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which is established by management as representative of the useful life of each category of asset 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
in estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired  assets are grouped at the operating unit level  which for most of our assets is the individual casino 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have approximately billion in goodwill and other intangible assets in our consolidated balance sheets resulting from our acquisition of other businesses 
the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we determine the estimated fair values based on independent appraisals  discounted cash flows  quoted market prices and estimates made by management 
to the extent that the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  such excess is allocated to goodwill 
an accounting standard adopted in requires a review at least annually of goodwill and other nonamortizing intangible assets for impairment 
we complete our annual assessment for impairment in fourth quarter each year 
in fourth quarter  we determined that certain goodwill had been impaired  and we recorded impairment charges of million in fourth quarter these charges relate to goodwill acquired in our acquisition of a property in lake charles  louisiana  and in our acquisition of louisiana downs 
since our acquisition of the lake charles property  competition has intensified in the market and the operating performance was declining 
as a result of the operating trends  compounded by the impact of hurricane damage in september  calculations indicated that the entire million of goodwill was impaired 
based on the historical performance and projected performance of louisiana downs  a thoroughbred race track that was expanded to include slot machines in  our analysis indicated that the entire million of goodwill associated with this property was impaired 
due to hurricane damage to our businesses in biloxi and gulfport  mississippi  in the fourth quarter of  we also wrote off million  before taxes  of goodwill and intangible assets that were assigned to those properties in our preliminary purchase price allocation of the caesars acquisition 
since grand casino gulfport is reported in our discontinued operations  the write off of goodwill and intangible assets for that properly of million  after taxes  is included in discontinued operations 
our annual assessment indicated that no goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite lives were impaired 
our annual assessment indicated that the goodwill associated with harrah s reno was impaired  and a charge of million was recorded in fourth quarter the annual evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizing intangible assets requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine their estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
once an impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets has been recorded  it cannot be reversed 
total rewards point liability program our customer loyalty program  total rewards  offers incentives to customers who gamble at certain of our casinos throughout the united states 
under the program  customers are able to accumulate  or bank  reward credits over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the program 
the reward credit balance will be forfeited if the customer does not earn a reward credit over the prior six month period 
as a result of the ability of the customer to bank the reward credits  we accrue the expense of reward credits  after consideration of estimated breakage  as they are earned 
the value of the cost to provide reward credits is expensed as the reward credits are earned and is included in casino expense on our consolidated statements of income 
to arrive at the estimated cost associated with reward credits  estimates and assumptions are made regarding incremental marginal costs of the benefits  breakage rates and the mix of goods and services for which reward credits will be redeemed 
we use historical data to assist in the determination of estimated accruals 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was accrued for the cost of anticipated total rewards credit redemptions 
in addition to reward credits  customers at certain of our properties  including the properties acquired in our acquisitions of caesars and horseshoe gaming  can earn points based on play that are redeemable in cash cash back points 
we accrue the cost of cash back points  after consideration of estimated breakage  as they are earned 
the cost is recorded as contra revenue and included in casino promotional allowances on our consolidated statements of income 
at december  and  the liability related to outstanding cash back points  which is based on historical redemption activity  was million and million  respectively 
bad debt reserves we reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected 
methodologies for estimating bad debt reserves range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables 
historical collection rates are considered  as are customer relationships  in determining specific reserves 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in our bad debt reserve 
as with many estimates  management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts 
self insurance accruals we are self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with general liability  workers compensation and employee health coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
at december  and  we had total self insurance accruals reflected in our consolidated balance sheets of million and million  respectively 
in estimating these costs  we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
we also rely on independent consultants to assist in the determination of estimated accruals 
these claims are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the undiscounted claims  including those claims incurred but not reported 
we believe the use of actuarial methods to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals  however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
we continually monitor the potential for changes in estimates  evaluate our insurance accruals and adjust our recorded provisions 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states as well as various states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or income tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and their respective tax bases using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on the income tax provision and deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
as indicated in note  we have provided a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits  certain state net operating losses nols  and other deferred state tax assets 
us tax rules require us to allocate a portion of our total interest expense to our foreign operations for purposes of determining allowable foreign tax credits 
consequently  this decrease to taxable income from foreign operations results in a diminution of the foreign taxes available as a tax credit 
although we consistently generate taxable income on a consolidated basis  certain state nols and other deferred state tax assets were not deemed realizable because they are attributable to subsidiaries that are not expected to produce future earnings 
other than these exceptions  we are unaware of any circumstances that would cause the remaining deferred tax assets to not be realizable 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
while positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws  we do not take such positions unless we have substantial authority to do so under the internal revenue code and applicable regulations 
we may take positions on our tax returns based on substantial authority that are not ultimately accepted by the irs 
we assess such potential unfavorable outcomes based on the criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we establish a tax reserve if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the unfavorable outcome can be reasonably estimated 
we assess the potential outcomes of tax uncertainties on a quarterly basis 
in determining whether the probable criterion of sfas no 
is met  we presume that the taxing authority will focus on the exposure and we assess the probable outcome of a particular issue based upon the relevant legal and technical merits 
we also apply our judgment regarding the potential actions by the tax authorities and resolution through the settlement process 
we maintain required tax reserves until such time as the underlying issue is resolved 
when actual results differ from reserve estimates  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the period resolved 
for tax years that are examined by taxing authorities  we adjust tax reserves in the year the tax examinations are settled 
for tax years that are not examined by taxing authorities  we adjust tax reserves in the year that the statute of limitations expires 
to the extent such adjustments are attributable to pre acquisition years of acquired entities  we record them as an adjustment to purchase price 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
in the event that the taxing authorities ultimately sustain adjustments to our previously reported taxable income  we will remit payments accordingly 
these remittances coupled with the expiration of bonus depreciation provisions in could cause total tax payments to exceed the reported amount of income tax expense 
however  we do not expect there to be any impact on the company s liquidity 
we classify reserves for tax uncertainties within accrued expenses and deferred credits and other in our consolidated balance sheets  separate from any related income tax payable or deferred income taxes 
reserve amounts may relate to the deductibility of an item  as well as potential interest or penalties associated with those items 
significant tax reserve adjustments impacting the effective tax rate are separately presented in the rate reconciliation table of note to our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued and proposed accounting standards the following are accounting standards adopted or issued in that could have an impact to our company 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that we recognize an expense for our equity based compensation programs  including stock options and stock appreciation rights 
expense will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity instruments being issued 
in second quarter  the application of sfas no 
r was changed from the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after june   to the first annual reporting period that begins after june  based on the new guidance  we will apply sfas no 
r in our first quarter reporting period 
we will adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  which requires us to recognize expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  we will recognize significantly more compensation expense in future periods 
we estimate that our incremental expense for stock awards due to implementation of sfas no 
r will be approximately million 
due to the timing of our annual stock awards grant  our expense will be higher in the last half of than in the first half 
because this estimate is based on assumptions including estimated new grants during  changes in stock price  forfeitures of awards and employee exercise behavior  the actual expense may be different from this estimate 
in september  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue  the effect of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share  which addresses when contingently convertible instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share 
per the consensus  contingently convertible instruments should be included in diluted earnings per share if dilutive regardless of whether the market price trigger has been met 
the consensus is to be applied to reporting periods ending after december  the dilutive effect of the contingently convertible instruments assumed in our acquisition of caesars is included in our diluted earnings per share calculation for the period ended december  in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  to address diverse accounting practices with respect to the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset when the timing or method of settlement of the obligation are conditional on a future event 
fin was effective no later than december   for calendar year companies  and had no effect on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 which changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle  as well as to changes required by an accounting pronouncement if the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle 
sfas no 
is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily changes in interest rates 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our debt between fixed rate and variable rate obligations 
of our approximate billion total debt at december   billion  including the fixed rate debt for which we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  is subject to variable interest rates 
the average interest rate on our variable rate debt  excluding the impact of our swap agreements  was at december  assuming a constant outstanding balance for our variable rate debt for the next twelve months  a hypothetical change in interest rates would change interest expense for the next twelve months by approximately million 
we utilize interest rate swaps to manage the mix of our debt between fixed and variable rate instruments 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the table below provides information as of december   about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract and weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  in millions thereafter total fair value liabilities long term debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate the fair values are based on the borrowing rates currently available for debt instruments with similar terms and maturities and market quotes of the company s publicly traded debt 
the fair values are based on market prices obtained from dealer quotes 
our long term variable rate debt reflects borrowings under revolving credit and letter of credit facilities provided to us by a consortium of banks with a total capacity of billion 
the interest rates charged on borrowings under these facilities are a function of the london inter bank offered rate  or libor and prime rate 
as such  the interest rates charged to us for borrowings under the facilities are subject to change as libor changes 
foreign currency translation gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december  although we are pursuing development opportunities in international markets  our only material ownership interest in businesses in foreign countries is an approximate ownership of a casino in uruguay 
however  we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future operating results or cash flows
