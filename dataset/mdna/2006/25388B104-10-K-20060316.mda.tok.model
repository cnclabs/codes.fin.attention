acquisitions and comparability of results 
our results of operations for the year ended december   include the results of acquisitions  including swreg in march and commerce  inc in december the results of these acquisitions must be factored into any comparison of our results to the results for or see note of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   for pro forma financial information as if these entities had been acquired on january  critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from services rendered once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met pervasive evidence of an agreement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment  and collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured 
we evaluate the criteria outlined in emerging issues task force  eitf issues no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in determining whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as net revenue 
we act as the merchant of record on most of the transactions processed and have contractual relationships with our clients  which obligate us to pay to the client a specified percentage of each sale 
we derive our revenue primarily from transaction fees based on a percentage of the products sale price and fees from services rendered associated with the e commerce and other services provided to our clients and end customers 
our revenue is recorded as net as generally our clients are subject to inventory risks and control 
table of contents customers product choices 
clients do not have the right to take possession of the software applications used in the delivery of services 
we also provide customers with various proprietary software backup services 
we recognize revenue for these backup services upon delivery or based upon historical usage within the contract period of the digital backup services when this information is available 
digital backup services are recognized straight line over the life of the backup service when historical usage information is unavailable 
shipping revenues are recorded net of any associated costs 
we also  to a lesser extent  provide fee based client services  which include website design  custom development and integration  analytical marketing and email marketing services 
if we receive payments for fee based services in advance of delivery  these amounts are deferred and recognized over the service period 
provisions for doubtful accounts and transaction losses and authorized credits are made at the time of revenue recognition based upon our historical experience 
the provision for doubtful accounts and transaction losses are recorded as charges to operating expense  while the provision for authorized credits is recognized as a reduction of net revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates and assumptions that can affect the amount of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses we report in any financial reporting period 
we use estimates in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  which are based on our historical experience and current trends 
we must estimate the collectability of our billed accounts receivable 
we analyze accounts receivable and consider our historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make significant judgments and estimates in connection with the allowance in any accounting period 
there may be material differences in our operating results for any period if we change our estimates or if the estimates are not accurate 
credit card chargeback reserve 
we use estimates based on historical experience and current trends to determine accrued chargeback expenses 
significant management judgments are used and estimates made in connection with the accrued expenses in any accounting period 
there may be material differences in our operating results for any period if we change our estimates or if the estimates are not accurate 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment  amortize certain intangibles and certain other long lived assets with definite lives over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimates of the period of time over which the assets will generate revenue or benefit our business 
we review assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value we are carrying on our financial statements for an asset may not be recoverable 
our evaluation considers non financial data such as changes in the operating environment and business strategy  competitive information  market trends and operating performance 
if there are indications that an impairment may be necessary  we use an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine the impairment amount  if any 
assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that an impairment may be necessary utilizing the two step approach prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
there have been no impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets for the years  and income taxes and deferred taxes 
we currently have significant us tax loss carryforwards resulting from the tax deduction for exercise of stock options and acquired operating tax loss carryforwards  and a lesser amount of acquired foreign operating tax loss carryforwards 
the benefit of the loss carryforwards from exercise of stock options was recognized as additional paid in capital when the deferred tax asset valuation allowance was removed in the fourth quarter of the benefit of the acquired tax loss carryforwards has been reserved by a valuation allowance pursuant to gaap 
these valuation reserves of the deferred tax asset will be removed if and when it is more likely than not that the 
table of contents deferred tax asset will be realized 
we intend to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance of the deferred tax asset on a quarterly basis 
if the benefit of these operating tax loss carryforwards is recognized  we will not recognize the benefit in the statement of income 
rather  the benefit will be recognized as a reduction to goodwill 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we may face challenges from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of tax due 
these challenges may include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  we record reserves for probable exposures 
based on our evaluation of our tax position  we believe the amounts related to these tax exposures are appropriately accrued and are not material 
to the extent we were to favorably resolve matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of the aforementioned reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be impacted 
no provision has been made for federal income taxes on approximately million of our international subsidiaries undistributed earnings as of december   since we plan to indefinitely reinvest all such earnings 
if these earnings were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  then we would be subject to us income taxes on such earnings 
the amount of us income taxes would be subject to adjustment for foreign tax credits and for the impact of the step up basis resulting from a section election made at the time of acquisition 
it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed

amortization of acquisition related intangibles increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in from and reflects the increased amortization of acquisitions partially offset by full amortization of certain past acquisitions 
we complete our annual goodwill impairment test using a two step approach in the fourth quarter of each year 
our assessment has indicated that there is no impairment of goodwill for the years ended december   and we have purchased  and expect to continue purchasing  assets or businesses  which may include the purchase of intangible assets 
income from operations 
our income from operations in was million  up from million in and million in as a percentage of revenue  income from operations was in  in and in the increase in income from operations in and resulted primarily from growth in revenue while our cost of revenue and operating expenses grew at a slower rate 
other income  net 
our other income  net line item is the total of interest income on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  interest expense on our debt and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense was million in compared with million in and no corresponding interest expense in losses from foreign currency were million in  and gains or losses were immaterial in and income taxes 
in  our tax expense was million  made up of approximately million of current tax expense and million of deferred tax benefit 
in  our tax expense was million  made up of international current tax expense 
we had no tax expense in as of december   we had net us tax loss carryforwards of approximately million  and foreign tax loss carryforwards of million 
the us amount consists of million of deductions resulting from exercise of stock options and million of acquired net operating losses 
these tax loss carryforwards expire in the years through the acquired net operating losses expire in the years through and are subject to other deductibility restrictions discussed below 
in prior years  there was uncertainty of future realization of the deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences and from tax loss carryforwards from operations and stock option deductions  therefore a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax assets was recorded 
we have evaluated our deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards from stock option deductions and concluded that the valuation allowance should be reversed 
we have met the requirements under gaap as we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of these deferred tax assets 
this is based primarily on our earnings history over the last three years as well as our expected future taxable income 
the impact on 
table of contents us taxable income of stock option deductions should not reduce taxable income to a level that would jeopardize this conclusion or unreasonably extend the period in which we may recognize the tax benefit associated with these deferred tax assets 
we also have evaluated our deferred tax assets related to acquired operating losses and we believe a full valuation allowance for these assets is required under gaap 
this valuation allowance is due to anticipated limitations  including limitations under section of the internal revenue code  on acquired losses and any future release of this valuation allowance will reduce goodwill 
comprehensive income 
comprehensive income includes revenues  expenses  gains and losses that are excluded from net earnings under gaap 
items of comprehensive income are unrealized gains and losses on short term investments and foreign currency translation adjustments which are added to net income to compute comprehensive income 
comprehensive income is net of income tax benefits or expense

there was no tax benefit or expense for comprehensive income in and as we had no tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments  and working capital of million 
the major components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and short term receivables net of client and merchant payables

net cash provided by operating activities in was the result of net income and increases in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities partially offset by increases in accounts receivable

table of contents net cash provided by financing activities in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
our external financing has been provided primarily by the sale of our stock and convertible notes in private and public offerings  and  to a lesser extent  by sales to employees under our employee stock purchase plan and by exercise of stock options 
in june  we sold and issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due january   in a private  unregistered offering 
the notes were subsequently registered for resale 
the notes were sold at of their principal amount 
the initial purchasers exercised in full their option to purchase up to an additional million in aggregate principal amount of the notes  closing on july  cash provided from the issuance of convertible senior notes in totaled million  net of financing expense 
in  a secondary offering of our common stock provided million of cash 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options provided cash of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  we repurchased million of common stock  which reduced our net cash provided by financing activities 
there were no stock repurchases in and liquidity and capital resource requirements we believe that existing sources of liquidity and the results of our operations will provide adequate cash to fund our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future  although we may seek to raise additional capital during that period 
in january  we filed a registration statement to increase our available shelf registration amount from approximately million to approximately million 
in addition  we filed an acquisition shelf for up to approximately million shares 
in february  we filed a shelf registration that would allow us to sell an undetermined amount of equity or debt securities in accordance with the recently approved rules applying to well known seasoned issuers 
these filings were made to provide future flexibility for acquisition and financing purposes 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
there can be no assurances that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
contractual obligations at december   our principal commitments consisted of interest and principal on our convertible senior notes and long term obligations outstanding under operating leases 
although we have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we anticipate continued capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in operations  infrastructure and personnel 
we expect that our operating expenses will continue to grow as our overall business grows and that they will be a material use of our cash resources 
payment due by period total amount and contractual obligations committed thereafter in thousands operating lease obligations convertible senior notes total with respect to our convertible senior notes  we are required to pay interest on the notes on january and july of each year 
the notes bear interest at a rate of and  if specified conditions are met  are convertible into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
the notes may be surrendered for conversion under certain circumstances  including the satisfaction of a market price condition  such that the price of our common stock reaches a specified threshold  the satisfaction of a trading price condition  such that the trading price of the notes falls below a specified level  the redemption of the notes by us  the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  as defined in the related indenture  and the occurrence of a fundamental change  as defined in the related indenture 
the initial conversion price is equivalent to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  of principal amount of the notes 
we will adjust the conversion price if certain events occur  as specified in the related 
table of contents indenture  such as the issuance of our common stock as a dividend or distribution or the occurrence of a stock subdivision or combination 
if a fundamental change  such as a change in our control  as defined in the related indenture  occurs on or before january   we also may be required to purchase the notes for cash and pay an additional make whole premium payable in our common stock  or in the same form of consideration into which all  or substantially  all of the shares of our common stock have been converted or exchanged in connection with the fundamental change  upon the repurchase or conversion of the notes in connection with the fundamental change 
holders of the notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes prior to maturity on january   and we have the right to redeem the notes  under certain circumstances  on or after july   and prior to january   and we may redeem the notes at any time on or after january  outlook we believe the outlook for our business remains positive for total online sales continue to increase globally and buyers appear increasingly comfortable shopping and purchasing online 
in our core market  trends continue to favor the transition from packaged  physical delivery of software products to electronic download 
in addition  our strategic marketing programs have been well received by our clients to date and we believe we can expand adoption of these services by additional clients as well as add new services 
we anticipate making additional investments to support existing client growth  new client additions  development of other complementary vertical markets  international expansion and improvements in our technology platform

sfas r is effective for all annual periods beginning after june  in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to the adoption of sfas r 
we will adopt sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal using the modified prospective method  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock  and the fair value of stock options will be determined using the black scholes valuation model 
we will continue to evaluate the impact of sfas r on our operating results and financial condition 
as a result of the provisions of sfas r and sab  we expect the compensation charges under sfas r to reduce diluted net income per share by approximately per share for fiscal however  our assessment of the estimated compensation charges will be affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and their related tax impacts 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the volatility of our stock price and employee stock option exercise behaviors

qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
interest rate risk our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments is maintained in a variety of securities  including government obligations and money market funds 
investments are classified as available for sale securities and carried at their market value with cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
at december  and  all securities held had maturities or reset dates of less than three years 
a sharp rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the market value of certain securities in our portfolio 
we do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure and do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes or utilize derivative financial instruments 
a hypothetical and immediate one percent increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value in our investment portfolio held at december  and  by million and by million  respectively 
a hypothetical and immediate one percent decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value in our investment portfolio held at december  and  by million and by million  respectively 
the approximate gains or losses in earnings are estimates  and actual results could vary due to the assumptions used 
at december  and  we had million of fixed rate contingent convertible debt outstanding 
we presently believe there is minimal risk that market interest rates will drop significantly below 
foreign currency risk our business has historically been transacted primarily in the us dollar and  as such  has not been subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
transaction exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of income 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues and operating expenses 
conversely  our net revenues and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
we do not currently have a currency hedging program to mitigate the effect of fluctuations of currency prices on our financial results 
the following schedule summarizes revenue  costs and expenses and income from operations that would have resulted had exchange rates in the current period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results

translation exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet 
these gains or losses are recognized as an adjustment to stockholders equity through accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax benefit or expense 
the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse currency movement is million and million for and  respectively
