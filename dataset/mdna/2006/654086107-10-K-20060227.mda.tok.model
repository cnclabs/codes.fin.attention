nicor gas is regulated by the icc  which has general regulatory power over practically all phases of the public utility business in illinois  including rates and charges  issuance of securities  services and facilities  system of accounts  investments  safety standards and transactions with affiliated interests and other matters 
nicor gas is permitted by the icc s pga regulation to adjust the charge to its sales customers on a monthly basis to recover the company s prudently incurred actual costs to acquire the natural gas it delivers to them 
the company s gas costs are subject to subsequent prudence reviews by the icc for which the company makes annual filings 
the annual prudence reviews for calendar years are open for review and any disallowance of costs in those proceedings could adversely affect nicor gas results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of annual prudence reviews 
most of nicor gas other charges are changed only through a rate case proceeding with the icc 
the charges established in a rate case proceeding are based on an approved level of operating costs and investment in utility property and are designed to allow the company an opportunity to recover those costs and to earn a fair return on that investment 
to the extent nicor gas actual costs to provide utility service are higher than the levels approved by the icc  nicor gas results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected until such time as it files for and obtains icc approval for new charges through a rate case proceeding 
nicor gas is also subject to rules and regulations pertaining to the integrity of its system and environmental compliance 
the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected by any additional laws or regulations that are enacted that require significant increases in the amount of expenditures for system integrity and environmental compliance 
a change in the icc s approved rate mechanisms for recovery of environmental remediation costs at former manufactured gas sites  or adverse decisions with respect to the prudence of costs actually incurred  could adversely affect the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
current environmental laws may require the cleanup of coal tar at certain former manufactured gas plant sites 
to date  nicor gas has identified about properties for which it may in part be responsible 
as of december   the company had recorded a liability of million associated with certain remediation efforts 
management believes that any such costs that are not recoverable from other entities or from insurance carriers are recoverable through rates for utility services under icc approved mechanisms for the recovery of prudently incurred costs 
a change in these rate recovery mechanisms  however  or a decision by the icc that some or all of these costs were not prudently incurred  could adversely affect the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition

nicor gas relies on direct connections to eight interstate pipelines and extensive underground storage capacity 
if these pipelines or storage facilities were unable to deliver for any reason it could impair nicor gas ability to meet its customers full requirements 
nicor gas meets its customers peak day  seasonal and annual gas requirements through deliveries of gas transported on interstate pipelines with which it or its gas suppliers have contracts and through withdrawals of gas from storage fields it owns or leases 
nicor gas contracts with multiple pipelines for these services 
if a pipeline were to fail to perform transportation or storage service  including as a result of war  acts or threats of terrorism or natural disaster  on a peak day or other day with high volume gas requirements  nicor gas ability to meet all its customers gas requirements may be impaired unless or until alternative arrangements for delivery of supply were put in place 
likewise  if a storage field owned by nicor gas  or a principal nicor gas owned transmission or distribution pipeline used to deliver gas to the market  were to be out of service for any reason  including as a result of war  acts or threats of terrorism or natural disaster  this could impair nicor gas ability to meet its customers full requirements 
fluctuations in weather have the potential to adversely affect the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
when weather conditions are milder than normal  nicor s gas distribution segment has historically delivered less natural gas  and consequently may earn less income 
nicor gas natural gas deliveries are temperature sensitive and seasonal since about one half of all deliveries are used for space heating 
typically  about three quarters of the deliveries and revenues occur from october through march 
mild weather in the future could adversely affect the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
natural gas commodity price changes may affect the operating costs and competitive positions of the company s businesses which could adversely affect its results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
nicor s energy related businesses are sensitive to changes in natural gas prices 
natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices for natural gas are subject to a variety of factors that are beyond nicor s control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the level of consumer demand for  and the supply of  natural gas  processing  gathering and transportation availability  the level of imports of  and the price of foreign natural gas  the price and availability of alternative fuel sources  weather conditions  political conditions or hostilities in natural gas producing regions 
any changes in natural gas prices could affect the prices nicor s energy related businesses charge  operating costs and the competitive position of products and services 
in accordance with the icc s pga regulations  nicor gas adjusts its gas cost charges to sales customers on a monthly basis to account for changes in the price of natural gas 
however  changes in natural gas prices can also impact certain operating expenses such as bad debt expense  company use gas and storage related gas expenses  financing costs and customer service expenses  and these changes can only be reflected in nicor gas charges to customers if approved by the icc in a rate case 
increases in natural gas prices can also have an adverse effect on natural gas distribution margin because such increases can result in lower customer demand 
nicor s other energy businesses are also subject to natural gas commodity price risk  arising primarily from fixed price purchase and sale agreements  natural gas inventories and utility bill management arrangements 
derivative instruments such as futures  options  forwards and swaps may be used to hedge these risks 
nicor is subject to margin requirements in connection with the use of derivative financial instruments and these requirements could escalate if prices move adversely 
nicor s use of derivative instruments could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
nicor uses derivative instruments  including futures  options  forwards and swaps  either traded on exchanges or executed over the counter with natural gas merchants as well as financial institutions  to hedge natural gas price risk 
fluctuating natural gas prices cause earnings and financing costs of nicor to be impacted 
the use of derivative instruments that are not perfectly matched to the exposure could adversely affect the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
also  when nicor s derivative instruments and hedging transactions fail to qualify for hedge accounting under statement of financial accounting standard no

in addition  these risks could result in loss of human life  significant damage to property  environmental pollution and impairment of nicor s operations  which in turn could lead to substantial losses 
in accordance with customary industry practice  nicor maintains insurance against some  but not all  of these risks and losses 
the location of pipelines and storage facilities near populated areas  including residential areas  commercial business centers and industrial sites  could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks 
the occurrence of any of these events if not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect nicor s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
an inability to access financial markets could affect the execution of nicor s business plan and could adversely affect the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition

management believes that nicor and its subsidiaries will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets based upon current credit ratings 
however  certain disruptions outside of nicor s control or events of default under its debt agreements may increase its cost of borrowing or restrict its ability to access one or more financial markets 
such disruptions could include an economic downturn  the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company or downgrades to nicor s credit ratings 
restrictions on nicor s ability to access financial markets may affect its ability to execute its business plan as scheduled and could adversely affect the company s results of operations  cash flows and financial condition
