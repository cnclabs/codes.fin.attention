in executing this strategy  the company has concentrated much of its lending efforts on nonresidential real estate and construction loans  originated substantially all fixed rate one to four family residential loans as a broker for a third party  and focused its deposit gathering efforts on core deposits demand deposit accounts  money market accounts  and savings accounts 
as a result  nonresidential real estate and construction loans comprised approximately of the company s loan portfolio at december   compared to approximately at december  also  during the same period  the company s portfolio of one to four family residential loans decreased from of the company s loan portfolio at december   to of the company s loan portfolio at december  core deposits have increased as a percentage of total deposits from approximately at december  to approximately at december  management expects to continue to execute this business strategy in on october   the company consummated the merger of trinity bank trinity into citizens south bank 
at the time of the acquisition  trinity had total assets of million  net loans of million  deposits of million  borrowed money of million and equity of million 
trinity was headquartered in monroe  north carolina  which is approximately miles east of the company s headquarters 
trinity had three offices located in union county  north carolina  which has the fastest population growth of any county in north carolina 
the combined bank has full service locations and one loan production office  and ranks th in the charlotte metropolitan statistical area in deposit market share 
under the terms of the merger agreement  the company issued a combination of common stock and cash for the outstanding common shares of trinity bank 
trinity shareholders were given the option of receiving shares of citizens south common stock for each share of trinity common stock  in cash for each share of trinity common stock  or a mixture of stock and cash for each trinity share  such that of the shares of trinity common stock will be exchanged for citizens south common stock

in connection with the issuance of the preferred securities  on october   the company entered into an indenture by and between the company and wilmington trust company  as trustee 
the preferred securities mature on december   but may be redeemed beginning december   if the company exercises its rights to redeem the debentures 
the preferred securities require quarterly interest payments to the holders of the preferred securities  initially at a fixed rate of through december  and thereafter at a variable rate of three month libor plus  reset quarterly

as a result of the execution of these capital management strategies  the company s equity to assets ratio was at december  management plans to continue to execute these strategies until the company s capital is appropriately leveraged 
the bank s results of operations are heavily dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on loans and securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also materially affected by the bank s provision for loan losses  gains or losses from the sales of assets  fee income generated from deposit and loan accounts  commissions earned from the sale of uninsured investment products  and noninterest expenses 
the bank s noninterest expense primarily consists of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy expense  professional services  advertising  and other noninterest expenses 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  changes in interest rates  and actions of regulatory and governmental authorities 
net income was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the earnings provided a return on average equity of in  compared to in  and a return on average assets of in  compared to in certain actions have been taken that have adversely impacted our results of operations for the years ended december  and specifically  during we acquired trinity bank in a transaction valued at million 
as a result of the acquisition of trinity  the company recognized merger and computer conversion related expenses of  during the year 
also  in we determined that unrealized losses on million in perpetual preferred stock issued by fannie mae and million in perpetual preferred stock issued by freddie mac were other than temporary impairments 
as a result  management recorded a noncash  pretax loss of  all of these securities were sold during and the company did not have any other perpetual preferred stock on its books at december  management s discussion and analysis is provided to assist in understanding and evaluating the results of operations and financial condition of the company and its subsidiaries

critical accounting policies the accounting and financial policies of the company and its subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices in the banking industry 
we consider accounting policies that require significant judgment and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations 
based on the size of the item or significance of the estimate  the following accounting policies are considered critical to our financial results 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb estimated probable loan losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the adequacy of the allowance is based on quarterly evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires an estimate of the loss for each type of loan and for each impaired loan  an estimate of the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows  and an estimate of the value of the collateral 
management has established a systematic method for periodically evaluating the credit quality of the loan portfolio in order to establish an allowance for loan losses 
the methodology is set forth in a formal policy and includes a review of all loans in the portfolio on which full collectibility may or may not be reasonably assured 
the loan review considers among other matters  the estimated fair value of the collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  our knowledge of inherent losses in the portfolio that are probable and reasonable estimable and other factors that warrant recognition in providing an appropriate loan loss allowance 
specific allowances are established for certain individual loans that management considers impaired under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the remainder of the portfolio is segmented into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics for evaluation and analysis 
in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower  the term of the loan  general economic conditions  and in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the collateral 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for loan losses against our current period income 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is consistently applied and is based on our past loan loss experience  particular risks inherent in the different kinds of lending that we engage in  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions  and other relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectibility 
management believes this is a critical accounting policy because this evaluation involves a high degree of complexity and requires us to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about various matters 
other than temporary impairment of securities 
we have historically reviewed investment securities with significant declines in fair value for potential other than temporary impairment pursuant to the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
effective december   management evaluated the company s investment portfolio and determined that all unrealized losses were the direct result of temporary changes in interest rates and that such losses may be recovered in the foreseeable future 
as a result  management did not consider any unrealized losses as other than temporary as of december  effective december   management determined that unrealized losses on million in perpetual preferred stock issued by fannie mae and million in perpetual preferred stock issued by freddie mac were other than temporary impairments 
as a result  management recorded a noncash  pretax loss of  the unrealized losses on these securities were considered to be other than temporary by management for the following reasons both fannie mae and freddie mac had experienced accounting irregularities that have resulted in restated financial results from prior periods  the yield on perpetual preferred stock recently issued by fannie mae is much higher than the yield of the preferred stock held by the company  which decreased the value of the company s security  the preferred stock for fannie mae was downgraded and the preferred stock for both companies were on a negative watch list  the freddie mac preferred stock repriced in december  yet it continued to have significant unrealized losses at year end  neither of the preferred stock issues had stated maturity dates  so the recovery of the unrealized losses was not expected to occur in the foreseeable future 
the credit issues facing fannie mae and freddie mac only affected the performance of the company s perpetual preferred stock 
management sold the subject securities in and the company did not own any other perpetual preferred stock at december  comparison of financial condition for the years ended december  and total assets increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  approximately million  or  of this asset growth was due to the acquisition of trinity  including the million in goodwill and core deposit intangible created as a result of this transaction 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  this increase was primarily funded by a million increase in deposits  a million increase in borrowed money  million in net sales  amortization  and maturies of investment and mortgage backed securities 
the effects of these increases in cash and cash equivalents were partly offset by a million increase in net outstanding loans  purchases of premises and equipment of million  stock repurchases totaling million and cash dividend payments of million 
the total deal value of the trinity acquisition of million was funded by the issuance of  shares of common stock valued at million with the remaining million in consideration provided by an increase in borrowed money 
management expects that the level of cash and cash equivalents will decrease in as these assets are used to fund additional loan growth 
investment securities increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  this increase was primarily the result of million in investment securities acquired from trinity 
during  the company sold million in investment securities  experienced maturities and calls of million in investments  and purchased million in investment securities 
management expects that outstanding investment securities will decrease during as the proceeds from maturities will be used to repay borrowed money and fund future loan growth 
mortgage backed securities decreased by million  or  from million at the end of  to million at the end of this decrease was primarily due to the maturity and principal amortization of million of mortgage backed securities  the sale of million of mortgage backed securities  and the purchase of million of mortgage backed securities during the year 
in addition  the company acquired million in mortgage backed securities in the trinity acquisition 
management expects that the principal amortization of its mortgage backed securities portfolio will decrease in as mortgage loan interest rates increase during the year 
management plans to reinvest the proceeds received from mortgage backed securities into higher yielding commercial and consumer loans as cash flows are generated from these investments through maturities and principal and interest payments 
net loans outstanding increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  approximately million  or  of net loan growth was due to the acquisition of trinity 
the remaining loan growth of million  or  was generated organically 
management continues to emphasize the origination of shorter term commercial real estate and consumer loans 
during  these loans  which include construction loans  multifamily residential loans  nonresidential real estate loans  consumer loans  and commercial business loans  increased by million  or  to million at december  also during  the company s portfolio of one to four family residential loans increased from million to million 
the company originates and closes substantially all new fixed rate one to four family residential loans as a broker for an independent third party on a servicing released basis 
this generates additional fee income and reduces the potential adverse effects of rising interest rates on the company s future earnings that normally result from holding long term fixed rate loans 
management expects that in the company s portfolio of one to four family dwelling loans will decrease while the remaining loan portfolio continues to experience strong growth due to the company s expansion into the york county  south carolina market with a loan production office during the first quarter of and the continued strong local economy of the charlotte metropolitan area 
also during  the company opened a full service office in belmont  north carolina  and acquired three full service offices from the trinity bank acquisition 
as a result  premises and equipment increased by million  or  to million at december  the company plans to enter into the york county  south carolina market with a loan production office in the first quarter of total liabilities increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  this increase was primarily due the million of liabilities acquired in the trinity acquisition 
the remaining million increase was primarily due to a million increase in deposits and a million increase in borrowed money 
total deposits increased by million  or  from million at december   to million at december  the trinity acquisition accounted for a million increase in deposits 
a large portion of the organic increase of million in deposits came from core deposits  which management considers to be checking accounts  money market accounts  and savings accounts 
this continued increase in core deposits reflects management s commitment to building new and enhancing existing customer relationships through improving technology and an expanding branch network 
borrowed money increased by million  or  from to this increase was partly due million in borrowed money acquired from trinity 
the remaining increase in borrowed money was primarily used for the purpose of providing funds to acquire trinity 
management expects that the level of borrowed money will decrease in as maturing advances are repaid using funds from maturing investment securities 
total stockholders equity increased by million  or  from million at december  to million at december  this increase was primarily due to the issuance of  shares of common stock totaling million in conjunction with the acquisition of trinity 
in addition  the company recognized million in net income for the year 
these increases were partly offset by the repurchase of  shares of common stock for million at an average price of per share 
these shares were repurchased as a part of stock repurchase plans announced in may and february the may repurchase plan provided for the repurchase of up to  shares of stock  or approximately of the outstanding shares 
all of the shares authorized under this plan were repurchased by february the february repurchase plan provided for the repurchase of  shares  or of the outstanding shares 
as of december   the company had repurchased  shares under the plan and had  shares remaining to be repurchased 
management plans to continue to repurchase shares of common stock in the company at prices that are considered to be attractive and in the best interests of both the company and its stockholders 
total stockholders equity also decreased in as a result of the payment of million in cash dividends  or per share  and a million increase in accumulated net unrealized losses on investments available for sale 
results of operations the following discussion relates to operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   as well as the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the net income of the company is heavily dependent upon net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on loans  investment and mortgage backed securities  and interest bearing deposits in other banks  offset by the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the earnings provided a return on average equity of in  compared to in  and a return on average assets of in  compared to in net interest income  the company s largest source of income  increased by million  or  to million during the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was due in part to a basis point increase in the average net interest rate spread from for to for this increase was largely due to a series of basis point increases in the federal funds rate by the federal reserve board that resulted in a increase in the prime lending rate during the year to at december  approximately of the company s loan portfolio reprices each month  the majority of which are tied to the prime lending rate 
this also contributed to a basis point increase in the company s net interest margin from in to in as interest rates stabilize  the company s net interest margin will come under some pressure as its portfolio of time deposits reprices at higher market rates without any offsetting increases in the yield on its prime based loan portfolio 
during  the company s ratio of average interest bearing assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in this declining ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities  which partly offset the positive effect of the increased net interest rate spread  was due primarily from the repurchase of  shares of common stock for million 
interest income for the year ended december   increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was primarily due to a million  or  increase in average interest earning assets from million in to million in  coupled with an basis point  or  increase in the average yield on interest earning assets to for during the year  average outstanding loans increased by million  or  from million to million  while the average yield on loans increased from to from to these changes were primarily the result acquiring million in loans from the trinity acquisition in october  organic loan growth of million during the year  and a increase in the prime lending rate during the year 
as a result  interest income on loans increased by million  or  to million in interest earned on interest bearing bank balances increased by  or  to  in the average balance of interest bearing bank balances increased by million  or  to million and the average yield on these deposits increased by basis points to 
interest earned on investment securities decreased by  or  to million in this increase in interest income was primarily due to a million  or  decrease in the average outstanding balance of investment securities to million in the average yield on investment securities increased by four basis points to for due to the increased level of short term interest rates during interest income from mortgage backed securities decreased by  or  to million in this decrease was largely due to an million  or  decrease in the average balance of mortgage backed securities to million during also  during  the average yield on mortgage backed securities increased from to  due in part to slower prepayment levels resulting from higher mortgage interest rates during the year 
management expects the levels of investment and mortgage backed securities will decline during  with the proceeds of any sales  maturities  and normal amortization  to be used to fund additional loan originations  stock repurchases  and repayments on maturing borrowed money 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to a million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities from million in to million in in addition  the average cost of funds increased by basis points  or  to in interest expense on deposits increased million  or  to million in this increase was primarily due to a million  or  increase in average deposits in and a basis point  or increase in the cost of deposits to in average deposits increased due to million in deposits acquired from trinity in october and million in organic growth 
the cost of funds increased due to the increase in short term rates during interest paid on borrowed money increased by  or  to million in average borrowings increased by million  or  to million at december   while the average rate paid on borrowings increased from in to in due to higher market interest rates in management expects that the cost of funds for deposits and borrowings will increase in if short term interest rates continue to increase 
the company provided  and  in loan loss provisions for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was at december   and at december  the provision for loan losses increased due to strong organic growth in the company s loan portfolio of million  coupled with net charge offs of  during the year 
the level of nonperforming loans increased by million to million at december  as a result  the ratio of nonperforming loans to net loans increased from at december   to at december  also  real estate owned increased by  to million at december  all of the properties acquired through foreclosure are one to four family residential properties and residential lots that are in various stages of disposition 
as a result  the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets increased from at december   to at december  refer to allowance for loan losses for further discussion 
for the year ended december   noninterest income decreased by  or  from million to million 
excluding the net gain on sale of securities and other assets of  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december   noninterest income increased by  or 
the company experienced increases of  in fee income on deposit accounts   from mortgage banking and lending activities   in commissions on sale of financial products   in dividends on fhlb stock   from the cash value of bank owned life insurance  and  in other noninterest income 
part of the reason for these increases was the additional noninterest income generated during the last two months of the year from the trinity acquisition 
the increase in mortgage banking and loan fee income was primarily due to an increased amount of fee income from commercial and consumer loans 
this increase was partly offset by decreased mortgage banking fees of  in as compared to this was largely due to an increase in longer term mortgage interest rates during which resulted in fewer mortgage loan originations 
management expects that mortgage lending activity will continue to slow down in if long term mortgage interest rates continue to rise during the year 
fee income on deposit accounts was higher largely due to the increased number of accounts which resulted in an increase in fees generated from overdrawn checking accounts 
management believes that a continued focus on growing retail and commercial checking accounts will result in a moderate improvement in fee income on deposit accounts in the increase on dividends on fhlb stock is directly related to the rate paid by the fhlb and the number of outstanding shares based on outstanding advances 
management expects that the dividend rate paid by the fhlb will increase in due to recent increases in short term interest rates 
commissions earned from the sale of uninsured products is expected to continue to increase as the company added an additional sales representative from the trinity acquisition 
these increases in noninterest income were partly offset by a  reduction in the fair value adjustment on deferred compensation assets which is offset by a corresponding decrease in compensation expense  resulting in no net impact on net income 
during  the company will realize the benefits of the trinity acquisition for the entire year  resulting in an expected continued increase in noninterest income 
gain on sale of securities decreased by  or  from to during the year ended december   the company sold million in investment securities and million in mortgage backed securities at a net gain of  the proceeds from these sales were used to generate funds to repurchase shares of stock and originate loans 
during the year ended december   the company sold million in investment securities and million in mortgage backed securities at a net gain of  most of these sales were from securities acquired from trinity 
these proceeds were primarily used to repurchase additional investments that were more reflective of the company s investment philosophy of investing in shorter term investment securities and mortgage backed securities that provide a stable level of cash flow to fund future loan growth 
the company also recognized a  net gain on sale of both  of other real estate owned and  of premises and equipment 
noninterest expense increased by  or  from million in to million in this increase was largely due to the acquisition of trinity  which added approximately employees and three additional full service offices  and the opening of a new full service office in belmont  north carolina 
as a result  compensation expense increased  or from million in to million in the company integrated the back office functions of trinity during the first quarter of  which will result in a decrease of approximately eight employees 
in addition  the company opened a loan production office in rock hill  south carolina  during the first quarter of  which will be staffed by two additional employees 
occupancy expense increased by  or  primarily due to the increase in the number of full service offices from at the end of to at the end of no additional full service offices are planned for the company also experienced merger and conversion expenses in in the amount of  no additional material merger related expenses are anticipated for data processing increased by  or  due to the operation of two computer systems resulting from the trinity acquisition 
the company plans to consolidate these two systems during the first quarter of other noninterest expense  which includes expenses related to employee travel and training  deposit operations  loan administration  financial reporting  franchise and other taxes  and other miscellaneous items  increased by  or  primarily due expenses related to operating a much larger organization 
in addition  modest increases were experienced in the areas of now account expense  and professional services 
the company expects to realize annualized pretax cost savings of approximately  after the completion of the computer and back office integration of trinity after the first quarter of most of these savings are expected to come from consolidating the back office functions of trinity into the existing operations of the company and the consolidation of the two computer systems 
the company experienced modest decreases in expense related to office supplies  advertising  telephone  and amortization of intangible assets 
advertising costs are expected to increase in as part of the company s efforts to retain trinity customers and build brand recognition in a new market 
the company has focused much of its marketing efforts on increasing its core deposits 
the company will continue to focus on building new retail and commercial loan and deposit relationships in in addition  the amortization of intangible assets is expected to increase to  in  from  in  due to the amortization of the core deposit intangible created as a result of the trinity acquisition 
the core deposit intangible resulting from the trinity acquisition has a balance of million  which is being amortized over an eight year period on an accelerated basis 
management expects that noninterest expense will increase in as the company operates a larger organization that includes four additional offices 
effective december   management determined that unrealized losses on million in perpetual preferred stock issued by fannie mae and million in perpetual preferred stock issued by freddie mac were other than temporary impairments 
as a result  management recorded a noncash  pretax loss of  the unrealized losses on these securities were considered to be other than temporary by management for the following reasons both fannie mae and freddie mac had experienced recent accounting irregularities that have resulted in restated financial results from prior periods  the yield on perpetual preferred stock recently issued by fannie mae is much higher than the yield of the preferred stock held by the company  which decreased the value of the company s security  the preferred stock for fannie mae was downgraded and the preferred stock for both companies are on a negative watch list  the freddie mac preferred stock repriced in december  yet it continued to have significant unrealized losses at year end  neither of the preferred stock issues had stated maturity dates  so the recovery of the unrealized losses is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future 
the credit issues facing fannie mae and freddie mac only affected the performance of the company s perpetual preferred stock 
the company did not own any other perpetual preferred stock at december  management did not consider any unrealized losses on its investment securities to be other than temporary as of december   since all unrealized losses were considered to be due to temporary changes in interest rates 
the company s provision for income taxes was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change was primarily due to a  increase in pretax income 
the effective tax rate increased from to due to a smaller percentage of income being derived from tax advantaged assets such as municipal securities  us government agency securities  and bank owned life insurance that generate tax exempt income 
management expects that the effective tax rate for will increase as a smaller percentage of pretax income is expected to be derived from tax advantaged assets 
comparison of results of operations for the years ended december  and net income was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the earnings provided a return on average equity of in  compared to in  and a return on average assets of in  compared to in net interest income  the company s largest source of income  decreased slightly in by  or 
this decrease was due in part to the declining ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities during the company s ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in due primarily from the repurchase of  shares of common stock for million 
the company s net interest margin increased slightly from in to in however  the spread between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities has improved by basis points from in to in this increase was largely due to a series of basis point increases in the federal funds rate by the federal reserve board that resulted in a increase in the prime lending rate during the year to at december  approximately of the company s loan portfolio reprices each month  the majority of which are tied to the prime lending rate 
as such  management believes that the company s net interest margin and resulting net interest income will improve in  if short term interest rates continue to increase  prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities slow to more normalized levels  and loan demand improves 
however  if short term interest rates decline  loan prepayments accelerate  or loan demand slows  management s expectations for may not be realized 
interest income for the year ended december   decreased by  or  to million 
this decrease was primarily due to a  or  reduction in interest income on loans 
during the year  average outstanding loans decreased by million  or  from million to million  while the average yield on loans decreased from to 
these changes were primarily the result of a continued high level of loan prepayments and refinancings that reduced both yields and outstanding balances 
the reduction in average outstanding loans was primarily concentrated in the company s portfolio of one to four family residential loans due to the fact that the company originates and closes substantially all new fixed rate residential loans as a broker for an independent third party 
this reduces the company s vulnerability to increases in interest rates and provides current period fee income 
during loans secured by one to four family residences decreased by million  or  to million at december   while the remaining loan portfolio  which consists of construction loans  multifamily residential loans  commercial real estate loans  commercial business loans and consumer loans  increased by million  or  to million at december  the company has expanded into the high growth market of cornelius  north carolina with a loan production office and has recently hired three additional commercial lenders and one additional mortgage loan originator 
management believes that these actions  coupled with the recent increases in the prime lending rate  will improve the level of outstanding loans and the yield on the loan portfolio in interest earned on interest bearing bank balances decreased by  or  to  in the average balance of interest bearing bank balances decreased by million  or  to million 
these funds were primarily used to repurchase stock and purchase higher yielding investment securities 
the average yield on these interest earning bank balances increased slightly from in to in interest earned on investment securities increased by  or  to million in this increase in interest income was primarily due to a million  or  increase in the average outstanding balance of investment securities 
these additional securities were funded primarily by deposit growth and existing interest bearing bank balances 
the average yield on investment securities decreased by basis points to for due to the historically low levels of short term interest rates during interest income from mortgage backed securities decreased by  or  to million in this decrease was largely due to a million  or  decrease in the average balance of mortgage backed securities during  resulting in part from the sale of million of mortgage backed securities during the year 
these proceeds were used  in part  to repurchase shares of the company s common stock in the company 
also  during  the average yield on mortgage backed securities decreased from to  due in part to higher prepayment levels resulting from attractive mortgage interest rates during the year 
management expects the levels of investment and mortgage backed securities will decline during  with the proceeds of any sales  maturities  and normal amortization  to be used to fund additional loan originations and stock repurchases 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased  or  to million 
this decrease was due to a  or  decrease in interest expense on deposits and a  or  decrease in interest expense on borrowed funds 
average interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to million at december  most of this increase was attributable to a million increase in average core deposits  which includes checking accounts  money market demand accounts  and savings accounts 
the remaining increase of million was attributable to certificates of deposits 
this change in the deposit mix reflects management s commitment to building new and enhancing existing customer relationships by focusing on a customer s primary financial needs such as checking accounts  savings accounts  and money market demand accounts 
the average interest rate paid on deposits decreased from in to in due to lower market rates and an emphasis on lower costing core deposits 
average borrowings increased by million  or  to million at december   while the average rate paid on borrowings decreased from in to in due to lower market interest rates in and the restructuring of million in federal home loan bank advances in this restructuring reduced the average interest rate on these million in advances from to 
management expects that the cost of funds for deposits and borrowings will increase in if short term interest rates continue to increase 
the company provided  and  in loan loss provisions for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was at december   and at december  the provision for loan losses increased due to strong growth in the company s loan portfolio of million  coupled with net charge offs of  during the year 
the level of nonperforming loans increased by  to  at december  most of this increase was attributable to a  increase in nonperforming one to four family residential loans  which are secured by real estate 
as a result  the ratio of nonperforming loans to net loans increased from at december   to at december  also  real estate owned increased by  to  at december  all of the properties acquired through foreclosure are one to four family residential properties that are in various stages of disposition 
as a result  the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets increased from at december   to at december  refer to the allowance for loan losses section of item of this report for further discussion 
for the year ended december   noninterest income decreased by  or  from million to million 
excluding the net gain on sale of securities and other assets of  for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december   noninterest income decreased by  or 
the primary reasons for the decrease were a  reduction in mortgage banking and loan fee income and a  reduction in the fair value adjustment on rabbi trust accounts 
the decrease in mortgage banking and loan fee income was primarily due to a reduced number of residential loan originations in as compared to this was largely due to a moderate increase in longer term mortgage interest rates during management expects that mortgage lending activity will continue to slow down in if long term mortgage interest rates continue to rise during the year 
the reduction in the fair value adjustment on rabbi trust accounts is offset by a corresponding decrease in compensation expense  resulting in no net impact on net income 
the company also realized moderate decreases in fee income on deposit accounts  commissions on sale of uninsured products  dividends on fhlb stock  and other income 
fee income on deposit accounts decreased by  or  due to a slight reduction of fees generated from overdrawn checking accounts 
management believes that a continued focus on growing retail and commercial checking accounts will result in a moderate improvement in fee income on deposit accounts in commissions earned from the sale of uninsured products decreased by  or  to  for the year ending december  during  the company changed brokerage vendors from uvest to raymond james and hired an additional sales representative 
management believes that these actions will result in increased commissions during the  decrease on dividends on fhlb stock is directly related to the rate paid by the fhlb and the number of outstanding shares based on outstanding advances 
management expects that the dividend rate paid by the fhlb will increase in due to recent increases in short term interest rates 
other income decreased by only  and is expected to be at a comparable level in gain on sale of securities decreased by  or  from to during the year ended december   the company sold million in investment securities and million in mortgage backed securities at a net gain of  the proceeds from these sales were used to generate funds to repurchase shares of stock and originate loans 
during the year ended december   the company sold million in investment securities and million in mortgage backed securities at a net gain of million 
these gains were used to offset the impact of vesting a portion of the shares of common stock granted in the citizens south banking corporation recognition and retention plan  which is described in note employee benefit plans under item of this report 
the company also recognized a  increase in net gain on sale of other assets from to this increase was primarily due to the sale of a branch office in that resulted in a gain of  the operations of this office were consolidated into the new corporate office in may and the office was subsequently vacated 
the office was sold for  in december noninterest expense decreased by  or  from million in to million in the primary reasons for this decrease were a  decrease in compensation  a million prepayment penalty on fhlb advances in  and a  reduction in the amortization of intangible assets 
the  or  decrease in compensation was largely due to a  reduction in the vesting expense of the common stock granted in the citizens south banking corporation recognition and retention plan 
the vesting schedule for this stock is in and in and each year thereafter until completely vested 
management expects that compensation expense will increase in as additional loan officers are hired to increase loan production  personnel are hired to staff a new office in belmont  north carolina and a loan production office in cornelius  north carolina  and unvested options are expensed in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
the million prepayment penalty in was associated with the restructuring of million in borrowed funds 
this action was taken by the company in an effort to capitalize on historically low interest rates  lower the company s cost of funds  and improve the company s net interest margin 
this restructuring is expected to reduce interest expense by approximately million over a five year period 
the amortization of intangible assets decreased by  or  during the company s core deposit intangible is being amortized over a eight year period on an accelerated basis 
the unamortized balance of the core deposit intangible as of december   was  management expects the expense from the amortization of intangible assets to continue to decrease in the company also realized moderate decreases in now account expenses  professional expenses  and deposit insurance 
management expects that these expenses will increase moderately in  as the number of checking accounts is expected to increase and additional professional services are expected to be needed due to changing laws and regulations 
the decreases in noninterest expenses listed above were partly offset by increases in occupancy expense  data processing  advertising  and other noninterest expenses 
occupancy expense increased by  or  to million in this increase was primarily due to the opening of the corporate office in and a new banking office in the third quarter of the company sold a banking office in december that was vacant as a result of the opening of the new corporate office in may management expects that office occupancy will increase in as the company opens a full service banking office in belmont  north carolina during the third quarter and obtains leased space for its loan production office in cornelius  north carolina 
data processing increased by  to  for the year ending december  during the company upgraded its technology capabilities in the areas of online banking  cash management services  document imaging and core processing 
these new capabilities allow the company to offer a higher level of service to its existing customers  and to better compete for new customers 
management expects that data processing costs will moderately increase in advertising expense increased by  or during to  the company has focused much of its marketing efforts on increasing its core deposits 
the company will continue to focus on building new retail and commercial loan and deposit relationships in advertising costs are expected to decrease slightly in other noninterest expenses  which includes expenses related to employee travel and training  deposit operations  loan administration  financial reporting  franchise and other taxes  and other miscellaneous items  increased by  or 
a large portion of the increase was due to training on the new computer system and enhanced products  relocating to the corporate office  and costs associated with supporting a larger number of deposit and loan accounts 
management expects that other noninterest expenses will decrease slightly in there were also moderate increases in expenses related to office supplies and telephone and communications 
these expenses are expected to remain flat in due to reduced per item costs prescribed in new vendor contracts for office supplies and telecommunications 
effective december   management determined that unrealized losses on million in perpetual preferred stock issued by fannie mae and million in perpetual preferred stock issued by freddie mac were other than temporary impairments 
as a result  management recorded a noncash  pretax loss of  the unrealized losses on these securities were considered to be other than temporary by management for the following reasons both fannie mae and freddie mac have experienced recent accounting irregularities that have resulted in restated financial results from prior periods  the yield on perpetual preferred stock recently issued by fannie mae is much higher than the yield of the preferred stock held by the company  which decreases the value of the company s security  the preferred stock for fannie mae was recently downgraded and the preferred stock for both companies are on a negative watch list  the freddie mac preferred stock repriced in december  yet it continued to have significant unrealized losses at year end  neither of the preferred stock issues have stated maturity dates  so the recovery of the unrealized losses is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future 
the credit issues facing fannie mae and freddie mac only impact the performance of the company s perpetual preferred stock 
the company did not own any other perpetual preferred stock at december  the company s provision for income taxes was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change was primarily due to an  decrease in pretax income 
the effective tax rate decreased from to due to a larger percentage of income being derived from tax advantaged assets such as municipal securities  us government agency securities  and bank owned life insurance that generate tax exempt income 
management expects that the effective tax rate for will increase as a smaller percentage of pretax income is expected to be derived from tax advantaged assets 
net interest income the net income of the company is heavily dependent upon net interest income 
net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income also depends on the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them  respectively 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company for the years ended december   and for the years indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  is expressed both in dollars and rates

net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets 
changes in interest income and expense can result from changes in both volume and rates

in the past  we concentrated our lending activities on conventional first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties 
however  since converting to a stock owned company in  the company has focused more of its lending activities on construction loans  nonresidential real estate loans  commercial business loans and consumer loans 
a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate  either as primary or secondary collateral  located in our primary market area 
the company has a diversified loan portfolio with no material concentrations to any one borrower or industry 
our lending activities are subject to the written  non discriminatory  underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by management and approved by our board of directors 
loan originations come from a number of sources including real estate agents  home builders  walk in customers  referrals and existing customers 
loan officers also call on local businesses soliciting commercial products 
we advertise our loan products in various print media including the local newspaper 
in our marketing  we emphasize our community ties  personalized customer service  and an efficient underwriting and approval process 
all real estate collateral is appraised or evaluated in accordance with regulatory requirements

in addition  the board of directors has delegated incremental loan approval limits to certain lending officers which allows them to approve a new loan to an existing customer in an amount equal to  or less than  their incremental loan limit that would otherwise require approval by the board of directors or the additional approval of another lending officer 
any loan approved by a lending officer using their incremental loan limit must be ratified by the board of directors or approved by another lending officer  as applicable  after the loan has been made

the average life of a loan is substantially less than its contractual terms because of prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on loans generally give us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of mortgage loans tends to increase  however  when current mortgage loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing mortgage loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing mortgage loans are substantially higher than current mortgage loan market rates 
nonperforming assets and delinquencies 
when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan  we attempt to cure the deficiency by contacting the borrower and collecting the payment 
computer generated late notices are mailed days after a payment is due 
in most cases  deficiencies are cured promptly 
if a delinquency continues  additional contact is made either through a notice or other means and we will attempt to work out a payment schedule and actively encourage delinquent residential mortgage borrowers to seek home ownership counseling 
while we generally prefer to work with borrowers to resolve such problems  we will institute foreclosure or other proceedings  as necessary  to minimize any potential loss 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status generally if  in the opinion of management  principal or interest payments are not likely in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement  or when principal or interest is past due days or more 
interest accrued but not collected at the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against income in the current period 
loans may be reinstated to accrual status when payments are under days past due and  in the opinion of management  collection of the remaining past due balances can be reasonably expected 
our board of directors is informed monthly of the total amount of loans which are more than days delinquent 
loans that are more than days delinquent or in foreclosure are reviewed by the board on an individual basis each month

real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate acquired in settlement of loans until sold 
generally  foreclosed assets are held for sale and such assets are carried at the lower of cost or market value minus estimated cost to sell the property 
after the date of acquisition  all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed and costs incurred for the improvement or development of such property are capitalized up to the extent of their net realizable value 
at december   we had million in real estate acquired in settlement of loans 
this balance is comprised of seven single family residences and twelve residential lots located in the bank s normal lending area 
these properties are in various stages of disposition 
restructured loans 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we are required to account for certain loan modifications or restructuring as a troubled debt restructuring 
in general  the modification or restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring if we  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grant a concession to the borrowers that we would not otherwise consider 
debt restructurings or loan modifications for a borrower do not necessarily always constitute troubled debt restructurings  however  and troubled debt restructurings do not necessarily result in nonaccrual loans 
we had three restructured loans as of december   totaling million 
asset classification 
the ots has adopted various regulations regarding problem assets of financial institutions 
the regulations require that each insured institution review and classify its assets on a regular basis 
in addition  in connection with examinations of insured institutions  ots examiners have the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the insured institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  we establish specific allowances for loan losses for the full amount of the portion of the asset classified as loss 
all or a portion of general loan loss allowances established to cover possible losses related to assets classified substandard or doubtful can be included in determining an institution s regulatory capital  while specific valuation allowances for loan losses generally do not qualify as regulatory capital 
assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated special mention and monitored by us 
as of december   we had million in assets classified substandard   classified doubtful  and no assets classified as loss 
the aggregate amount designated special mention as of december   was million 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  management determined that impaired loans were not material as of december  as of december   we had million classified as substandard   classified as doubtful and no assets classified as loss 
the aggregate amount designated special mention was million 
pursuant to sfas  management determined that impaired loans were not material as of december  allowance for loan losses management has established a systematic methodology for evaluating the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses 
the methodology is set forth in a formal policy and considers all loans in the portfolio 
specific allowances are established for certain individual loans that management considers impaired under sfas the remainder of the portfolio is segmented into groups of loans with similar risk characteristics for evaluation and analysis 
in originating loans  we recognize that losses will be experienced and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower  the term of the loan  general economic conditions  and in the case of a secured loan  the quality of the collateral 
we increase our allowance for loan losses by charging provisions for loan losses against our current period income 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is consistently applied and is based on our past loan loss experience  particular risks inherent in the different kinds of lending that we engage in  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions  and other relevant internal and external factors that affect loan collectibility 
at december   we had an allowance for loan losses of million 
management believes that this amount meets the requirement for losses on loans that management considers to be impaired  for known losses  and for risks inherent in the remaining loan portfolios 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to make such determinations  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
the allowance for loan losses is subject to periodic evaluation by various regulatory authorities and may be subject to adjustment upon their examination

we review our deposit mix and pricing weekly 
we believe that we are competitive in the type of accounts and interest rates we offer on our deposit products 
we do not seek to pay the highest deposit rates  but a competitive rate

as such  the company fully expects to be able to meet future capital needs caused by growth and expansion as well as regulatory requirements 
the company plans to continue to repurchase its shares of common stock in the open market from time to time as market conditions warrant

liquidity the objectives of the company s liquidity management policy include providing adequate funds to meet the cash needs of both borrowers and depositors  to provide for the on going operations of the company  and to capitalize on opportunities for expansion 
liquidity management addresses the company s ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity  to repay borrowings as they mature  and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
the primary sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable  increases in local deposits  cash flows generated from operations  and cash flows generated by investments 
if the company requires funds beyond its internal funding capabilities  it may rely upon external sources of funds such in brokered deposits and federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
the company has million in additional advances available from its line of credit from the fhlb 
the fhlb functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions 
as a member of the fhlb  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and we are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our mortgage loans and other assets principally securities that are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the us government provided certain creditworthiness standards have been met 
advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based on the financial condition of the member institution and the adequacy of collateral pledged to secure the credit 
the company may also solicit brokered deposits for providing funds for asset growth  however  to date  the company has not used such deposits to supplement its liquidity position 
in the normal course of business  various commitments are outstanding that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments to extend credit and undisbursed advances on customer lines of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
the funding of these commitments and previously approved undisbursed lines of credit could effect the company s liquidity position 
at december   the company had loan commitments of million  including million in undisbursed construction loan proceeds  and unused lines of credit of million 
the company believes that it has adequate resources to fund loan commitments and lines of credit as they arise 
the company does not have any special purpose entities of other similar forms of off balance sheet financing 
under existing contractual obligations  the company will be required to make payments in future periods 
the following table presents aggregated information about payments due under such contractual obligations at december  the company expects that a portion of the deposits will not be renewed upon maturity 
if there is a higher than normal level of time deposits that are not renewed at maturity  then the company may experience a decrease in liquidity 
this may result in the company offering higher than market interest rates to maintain deposits  which would increase interest expense

the risk of loss can be reflected in diminished market values and or reduced net interest income in future periods 
the company s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk  as the majority of the company s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the structure of the company s loan and deposit portfolios is such that significant declines in interest rates could adversely impact net market values and net interest income 
the company does not maintain a trading account  nor is it subject to currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
the company s asset liability committee alco is responsible for monitoring and managing exposure to interest rate risk  as discussed below in interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity the company s alco monitors the company s level of interest rate sensitivity and ensures that the level of sensitivity of the company s net portfolio value is maintained within limits established by the board of directors 
through such management  the alco seeks to reduce the vulnerability of the company s operations to changes in interest rates 
during the past year  the alco utilized the following strategies to manage interest rate risk emphasizing the origination and retention of short term commercial business loans and nonresidential mortgage loans  emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate home equity lines of credit  emphasizing the origination and retention of adjustable rate one to four family residential mortgage loans  originating all new fixed rate mortgage loans as a broker for a third party  and investing in shorter term investment securities 
the office of thrift supervision requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of the bank s cash flow from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items the bank s net portfolio value or npv and the net interest income nii of the bank would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
these computations estimate the effect on a bank s npv and nii from instantaneous and permanent one hundred to three hundred basis point increases and decreases in market interest rates 
the following table presents the bank s projected change in npv and nii at december   as calculated by an independent third party  based upon information provided by the bank 
the bank s level of sensitivity  given a hypothetical  immediate  and sustained change in interest rates from basis points to basis points  is within the range of acceptable sensitivity established by the board of directors 
table interest rate sensitivity estimated theoretical estimated theoretical hypothetical  immediate  net interest income net portfolio value and sustained changes in interest rates amount change amount change dollars in thousands basis point rise   basis point rise   basis point rise   no change   basis point decline   basis point decline   basis point decline   certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in npv require the making of certain assumptions  which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of the interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the company s performance than the effect of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services
