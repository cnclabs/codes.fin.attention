item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations years ended december  dollars in millions  except per share amounts  unless otherwise stated forward looking and cautionary statements some of the statements contained in this annual report discuss future expectations and business strategies or include other forward looking information 
those statements are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements 
the forward looking information is based on various factors and was derived using numerous assumptions 
overview we are the largest source of funding  delivery and servicing support for education loans in the united states 
our primary business is to originate  acquire and hold both federally guaranteed student loans and private education loans  which are not federally guaranteed 
the primary source of our earnings is from net interest income earned on those student loans as well as gains on the sales of such loans in securitization transactions 
we also earn fees for pre default and post default receivables management services on student loans  such that we are engaged in every phase of the student loan life cycle from originating and servicing student loans to default prevention and ultimately the collection on defaulted student loans 
through recent acquisitions  we have expanded our receivables management services to a number of different asset classes outside of student loans 
we also provide a wide range of other financial services  processing capabilities and information technology to meet the needs of educational institutions  lenders  students and their families  and guarantee agencies 
slm corporation  more commonly known as sallie mae  is a holding company that operates through a number of subsidiaries 
references in this report to the company refer to slm corporation and its subsidiaries 
we have used both internal growth and strategic acquisitions to attain our leadership position in the education finance marketplace 
our sales force  which delivers our products on campuses across the country  is the largest in the student loan industry 
the core of our marketing strategy is to promote our on campus brands  which generate student loan originations through our preferred channel 
loans generated through our preferred channel are more profitable than loans acquired through other acquisition channels because we own them earlier in the student loan s life and generally incur lower costs to acquire such loans 
we have built brand leadership through the sallie mae name  the brands of our subsidiaries and those of our lender partners 
these sales and marketing efforts are supported by the largest and most diversified servicing capabilities in the industry  providing an unmatched array of services to financial aid offices 
in recent years  we have diversified our business through the acquisition of several companies that provide receivables management and debt collections services  all of which are combined in our debt management operations dmo operating segment 
initially these acquisitions were concentrated in the student loan industry  but through our acquisitions of afs holdings  llc  the parent company of arrow financial services  llc collectively  afs in september and grp ag holdings  llc and its subsidiaries grp in august  we expanded our capabilities to include purchasing portfolios and collecting on debt in a number of different industries 
the dmo business segment has been expanding rapidly such that revenue grew percent in the year ended december  compared to  and we now employ approximately  people in this segment 
in december  we completed the wind down of the gse through the defeasance of all remaining gse debt obligations and dissolution of the gse s federal charter 
the liquidity provided to the company by the gse has been replaced primarily by securitizations 
in addition to securitizations  we have also increased and diversified our investor base over the last three years to enable us to access a number of additional sources of liquidity including an asset backed commercial paper program  unsecured revolving credit facilities  and other unsecured corporate debt and equity security issuances 
we manage our business through two primary operating segments the lending operating segment and the dmo operating segment 
accordingly  the results of operations of the company s lending and dmo operating segments are presented separately below under business segments 
these operating segments are considered reportable segments under the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  based on quantitative thresholds applied to the company s financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates managment s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the unites states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements  significant accounting policies  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  particularly those that include the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and are often about matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates relate to the following accounting policies that are discussed in more detail below application of the effective interest method for loans premiums  discounts and borrower benefits  securitization accounting and retained interests  provisions for loan losses  and derivative accounting 
also  as part of our regular quarterly evaluation of the critical estimates used by the company  we have updated a number of estimates to account for the increase in consolidation loan activity 
premiums  discounts and borrower benefits for both federally insured and private education loans  we account for premiums paid  discounts received and certain origination costs incurred on the origination of student loans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases 
the unamortized portion of the premiums and the discounts is included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of student loan discounts  as well as the impact of borrower benefits 
in arriving at the expected yield  we must make a number of estimates that when changed must be reflected as a cumulative catch up from the inception of the student loan 
the most sensitive estimate for premium and discount amortization is the estimate of the constant prepayment rate cpr which measures the rate at which loans in the portfolio pay before their stated maturity 
the cpr is used in calculating the average life of the portfolio 
a number of factors can affect the cpr estimate such as the rate of consolidation loan activity and default rates 
changes in cpr estimates are discussed in more detail below 
the impact of borrower benefits is dependent on the estimate of the number of borrowers who will eventually qualify for these benefits 
for competitive purposes  we occasionally change borrower benefits programs in both amount and qualification factors 
these programmatic changes must be reflected in the estimate of the borrower benefits discount 
securitization accounting and retained interests we regularly engage in securitization transactions as part of our financing strategy see also liquidity and capital resources securitization activities 
in a securitization  we sell student loans to a trust that issues bonds backed by the student loans as part of the transaction 
when our securitizations meet the sale criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of sfas no 
 we record a gain on the sale of the student loans  which is the difference between the allocated cost basis of the assets sold and the relative fair value of the assets received 
the primary judgment in determining the fair value of the assets received is the valuation of the residual interest 
the residual interests in each of our securitizations are treated as available for sale securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and therefore must be marked to market with temporary unrealized gains and losses recognized  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
since there are no quoted market prices for our residual interests  we estimate their fair value both initially and each subsequent quarter using the key assumptions listed below the projected net interest yield from the underlying securitized loans  which can be impacted by the forward yield curve  as well as the borrower benefits program  the calculation of the embedded floor income associated with the securitized loan portfolio  the cpr  the discount rate used  which is intended to be commensurate with the risks involved  and the expected credit losses from the underlying securitized loan portfolio 
we recognize interest income and periodically evaluate our residual interests for other than temporary impairment in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and residual beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
under this standard  each quarter we estimate the remaining cash flows to be received from our retained interests and use these revised cash flows to prospectively calculate a yield for income recognition 
in cases where our estimate of future cash flows results in a lower yield from that used to recognize interest income in the prior quarter  the residual interest is written down to fair value  first to the extent of any unrealized gain in accumulated other comprehensive income  then through earnings as an other than temporary impairment  and the yield used to recognize subsequent income from the trust is negatively impacted 
we also receive income for servicing the loans in our securitization trusts 
we assess the amounts received as compensation for these activities at inception and on an ongoing basis to determine if the amounts received are adequate compensation as defined in sfas no 
to the extent such compensation is determined to be no more or less than adequate compensation  no servicing asset or obligation is recorded 
provisions for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at an amount sufficient to absorb losses inherent in our ffelp and private education loan portfolios at the reporting date based on a projection of estimated probable net credit losses 
the maturing of our private education loan portfolios has provided us with more historical data on borrower default behavior such that we now analyze those portfolios to determine the effects that the various stages of delinquency have on borrower default behavior and ultimate charge off 
as a result  in the second quarter of  we changed our estimate of the allowance for loan losses for our managed loan portfolio to include a migration analysis of delinquent and current accounts  in addition to other considerations 
a migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a loan receivable may progress through the various delinquency stages and ultimately charge off  and is a widely used reserving methodology in the consumer finance industry 
previously  we calculated the allowance for private education loan losses by estimating the probable losses in the portfolio based primarily on loan characteristics and where pools of loans were in their life  with less emphasis on current delinquency status of the loan 
also  in our prior methodology for calculating the allowance  some private education loan loss rates were based on proxies and extrapolations of ffelp loan loss data 
we also transitioned to a migration analysis to revise our estimated losses associated with accrued interest income 
under the new methodology  we estimate the amount of uncollectible accrued interest on private education loans and write it off against current period interest income 
under our prior methodology  private education loans continued to accrue interest  even during periods of forbearance  until they were charged off  at which time  the loans were placed on non accrual status and all previously accrued interest was reversed against income in the month of charge off 
the allowance for loan losses provided for a portion of the probable losses in accrued interest receivable prior to charge off 
this change in reserving methodology has been accounted for as a change in estimate in accordance with the accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
the effect of this change in estimate was to increase the allowance by million and to reduce student loan interest income for the estimate of uncollectible accrued interest receivable by million 
on the income statement  adjustments to the allowance are recorded through the provisions for losses whereas adjustments to accrued interest are recorded in interest income 
when calculating the private education loan loss reserve  we divide the portfolio into categories of similar risk characteristics based on loan program type  loan status in school  grace  repayment  forbearance  delinquency  underwriting criteria  existence or absence of a co borrower  and aging 
we then apply default and collection rate projections to each category 
our higher education private education loan programs percent of the managed private education loan portfolio at december  do not require the borrowers to begin repayment until six months after they have graduated or otherwise left school 
consequently  our loss estimates for these programs are minimal while the borrower is in school 
our career training and alternative private education loan programs percent of the managed private education loan portfolio at december  generally require the borrowers to start repaying their loans immediately 
at december   percent of the principal balance in the higher education managed private education loan portfolio related to borrowers who are still in school and not required to make payments 
as the current portfolio ages  an increasing percentage of the borrowers will leave school and be required to begin payments on their loans 
the allowance for losses will change accordingly with the percentage of borrowers in repayment 
our loss estimates include losses to be incurred generally over a two year loss confirmation period 
similar to the rules governing ffelp payment requirements  our collection policies allow for periods of nonpayment for borrowers requesting additional payment grace periods upon leaving school or experiencing temporary difficulty meeting payment obligations 
this is referred to as forbearance status 
the majority of forbearance occurs early in the repayment term when borrowers are starting their careers see lending business segment private education loans delinquencies 
at december   percent of the managed private education loan portfolio in repayment and forbearance was in forbearance status 
the loss confirmation period is in alignment with our typical collection cycle and takes into account these periods of nonpayment 
private education loan principal is charged off against the allowance at days delinquency 
recoveries on loans charged off are recorded directly to the allowance 
effective for a renewable one year period beginning in october  sallie mae s loan servicing division  sallie mae servicing  was designated as an exceptional performer ep by the us department of education ed in recognition of meeting certain performance standards set by ed in servicing ffelp loans 
as a result of this designation  the company received percent reimbursement declining to percent on july  under new legislation discussed below on default claims on federally guaranteed student loans that are serviced by sallie mae servicing for a period of at least days before the date of default and will no longer be subject to the two percent risk sharing on these loans 
the company is entitled to receive this benefit as long as the company remains in compliance with the required servicing standards  which are assessed on an annual and quarterly basis through compliance audits and other criteria 
the ep designation applies to all ffelp loans that are serviced by the company as well as default claims on federally guaranteed student loans that the company owns but are serviced by other service providers with the ep designation 
at december   approximately percent of the company s on balance sheet federally insured loans are serviced under the ep designation 
on february   the reauthorization of the hea was signed into law 
see other related events and information reauthorization for a full update of the hea 
the legislation reduces the level of default insurance to percent from percent effectively increasing risk sharing from two percent to three percent on loans disbursed after july  for lenders without the ep designation 
furthermore  the bill reduces the default insurance paid to lenders servicers with the ep designation to percent from percent on claims filed on or after july  as a result of the amended insurance levels  we established a risk sharing allowance as of december  for an estimate of losses on ffelp student loans based on the one percent reduction in default insurance for servicers with the ep designation 
the reserve was established using a migration analysis similar to that described above for the private education loans before applying the appropriate risk sharing percentage 
as a result  for the year ended december   we provided for additional reserves of million for on balance sheet ffelp loans and million for managed ffelp loans 
the evaluation of the provisions for loan losses is inherently subjective  as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to cover probable losses in the student loan portfolio 
derivative accounting we use interest rate swaps  foreign currency swaps  interest rate futures contracts  floor income contracts and interest rate cap contracts as an integral part of our overall risk management strategy to manage interest rate risk arising from our fixed rate and floating rate financial instruments 
we account for these instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that every derivative instrument  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
we determine the fair value for our derivative instruments using pricing models that consider current market values and the contractual terms of the derivative contracts 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recognized  the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
as a matter of policy  we compare the fair values of our derivatives that we calculate to those provided by our counterparties on a monthly basis 
any significant differences are identified and resolved appropriately 
we make certain judgments in the application of hedge accounting under sfas no 
the most significant judgment relates to the application of hedge accounting in connection with our forecasted debt issuances 
under sfas no 
 if the forecasted transaction is probable to occur then hedge accounting may be applied 
we regularly update our probability assessment related to such forecasted debt issuances 
this assessment includes analyzing prior debt issuances and assessing changes in our future funding strategies 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria as specified by sfas no 
are met 
we believe that all of our derivatives are effective economic hedges and are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy 
however  under sfas no 
 some of our derivatives  primarily floor income contracts  certain eurodollar futures contracts  basis swaps and equity forwards  do not qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
therefore  changes in market value along with the periodic net settlements must be recorded through the gains losses on derivative and hedging activities  net line in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item 
the derivative market value adjustment is primarily caused by interest rate volatility  changing credit spreads during the period  and changes in our stock price related to equity forwards and the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge accounting treatment 
see also business segments alternative performance measures pre tax differences between core earnings and gaap derivative accounting for a detailed discussion of our accounting for derivatives 
effects of consolidation loan activity on estimates the combination of aggressive marketing in the student loan industry and the ability to obtain a long term  fixed rate loan at low interest rates coupled with the rise in short term interest rates has led to continued high levels of consolidation loan volume  which  in turn  has had a significant effect on a number of accounting estimates in recent years 
as long as long term interest rates remain at historically low levels  we expect the consolidation loan program to continue to be an attractive option for borrowers 
we have updated our assumptions that are affected primarily by consolidation loan activity and updated the estimates used in developing the cash flows and effective yield calculations as they relate to the amortization of student loan premiums and discounts  borrower benefits  residual interest income and the valuation of the residual interest 
consolidation loan activity affects each estimate differently depending on whether the original ffelp loans being consolidated were on balance sheet or off balance sheet and whether the resulting consolidation loan is retained by us or consolidated with a third party 
when we consolidate a ffelp loan that was in our portfolio  the term of that loan is generally extended and the term of the amortization of the capitalized acquisition costs premium is likewise extended to match the new term of the loan 
in that process  the premium balance must be adjusted to reflect the new expected term of the consolidated loan as if it had been in place from inception 
the estimate of the cpr also affects the estimate of the average life of securitized trusts and therefore affects the valuation of the residual interest 
prepayments shorten the average life of the trust  and if all other factors remain equal  will reduce the value of the residual interest  the securitization gain on sale and the effective yield used to recognize interest income 
prepayments on student loans in securitized trusts are primarily driven by the rate at which securitized ffelp loans are consolidated 
when a loan is consolidated from the trust either by us or a third party  the loan is treated as a prepayment 
in cases where the loan is consolidated by us  it will be recorded as an on balance sheet asset 
we discuss the effects of changes in our cpr estimates in liquidity and capital resources securitization activities and liquidity risk and funding

as discussed in detail above in the overview section  we have two primary business segments  lending and dmo  plus a corporate and other business segment

consolidated earnings summary the main drivers of our net income are the growth in our managed student loan portfolio  which drives net interest income and securitization transactions  market value gains and losses on derivatives that do not receive hedge accounting treatment  the timing and size of securitization gains  growth in our fee based business and expense control 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   our net income decreased by percent to billion diluted earnings per share from net income of billion diluted earnings per share in on a pre tax basis  income for the year ended december  decreased by percent to billion versus billion in the year ended december  the larger percentage decrease in net income versus pre tax income from to is primarily due to the increase in the effective tax rate from percent in the year ended to percent in the year ended fluctuations in the effective tax rate are driven by the permanent impact of the exclusion of the gains and losses on equity forward contracts with respect to the company s stock for tax purposes 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  we are required to mark the equity forward contracts to market each quarter and recognize the change in their value in income 
conversely  these unrealized gains and losses are not recognized on a tax basis 
in the year ended  we recognized unrealized gains on our outstanding equity forward contracts of million versus unrealized gains of million in the year ended the decrease in pre tax income is primarily due to a million decrease in the gain on derivative and hedging activities  which primarily relates to derivatives that do not receive hedge accounting treatment 
unrealized derivative gains and losses are primarily driven by the effect of changes in the fair market value of floor income contracts and the effect of an increase in the value of our stock price on equity forward contracts 
the smaller unrealized gains on our floor income contracts in were due to fewer contracts being in the money to the counterparty due to spot interest rates  and to a smaller rise in forward interest rates in versus our stock price increased in both and  but the absolute increase was less in resulting in a smaller unrealized gain on our equity forward contracts in the year over year decrease in servicing and securitization revenue was due primarily to impairment of our retained interests in securitizations of million in versus million in these impairments are largely driven by the continued rise in consolidation loan activity 
the increase in impairment losses was partially offset by an increase in securitization gains of million primarily caused by higher percentage gains on the private education loan securitizations 
the year over year increase in debt management fees and collections revenue of million is primarily due to a full year impact of collections revenue from afs  acquired in the third quarter of  and overall growth in the contingency fee businesses 
positive impacts to pre tax income were offset by the year over year increase in operating expenses of million  primarily attributable to the expenses associated with three subsidiaries acquired in the second half of afs  southwest student services corporation southwest and student loan finance association slfa 
net income for the year ended december  was also negatively impacted by a million pre tax loss related to the repurchase and defeasance of billion of gse debt in connection with the gse wind down in our managed student loan portfolio grew by billion  from billion at december  to billion at december  this growth was fueled by the acquisition of billion of student loans in the year ended  a percent increase over the billion acquired in  exclusive of student loans acquired from the acquisition of southwest and slfa 
in the year ended  we originated billion of student loans through our preferred channel  an increase of percent over the billion originated in the year ended year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   our net income was billion diluted earnings per share versus net income of billion diluted earnings per share in the increase in net income from to is due to several factors 
the principal driver of the growth in net income was a billion pre tax increase in the derivative market value adjustment 
the derivative market value gain can primarily be attributed to the positive effect that the increase in forward interest rates had on the valuation of our liability for floor income contracts and to gains on our equity forward contracts caused by the increase in the market value of our common stock 
in  other income which includes guarantor servicing fees  debt management fees and collections revenue  and other fee based income increased by percent to million versus this increase can mainly be attributed to an increase in revenue from our dmo segment  late and other borrower fees and to termination fees from bank one 
in  other income benefited from a million gain on the sale of our prior headquarters building 
the year over year increases in other income were offset by million in lower securitization gains due to consolidation loan securitizations not qualifying for off balance sheet treatment and million in lower servicing and securitization revenue due primarily to lower embedded floor income 
net income in was also negatively impacted by a million pre tax loss related to the repurchase and defeasance of billion of gse debt in connection with the gse wind down and a percent increase in other operating expenses to million versus this increase can be attributed to acquisitions and increased servicing and debt management expenses consistent with the growth in borrowers and the growth in the debt management business 
also  in  net interest income after provisions for loan losses was relatively flat versus caused by two offsetting factors the increase in net interest income  driven by an billion increase in our average balance of on balance sheet student loans  and offset by the reduction in floor income caused by higher interest rates 
our managed student loan portfolio grew by billion  from billion at december  to billion at december  this growth was fueled by the billion in new managed student loans acquired in  a percent increase over the billion acquired in in  we originated billion of student loans through our preferred channel  an increase of percent over the billion originated in net interest income net interest income  including interest income and interest expense  is derived primarily from our portfolio of student loans that remain on balance sheet and to a lesser extent from other loans  cash and investments

student loans for both federally insured student loans and private education loans  we account for premiums paid  discounts received and certain origination costs incurred on the origination of student loans in accordance with sfas no 
the unamortized portion of the premiums and discounts are included in the carrying value of the student loan on the consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize income on our student loan portfolio based on the expected yield of the student loan after giving effect to the amortization of purchase premiums and the accretion of student loan discounts  as well as the discount expected to be earned through borrower benefits programs 
discounts on private education loans are deferred and accreted to income over the lives of the student loans 
in the table below  this accretion of discounts is netted with the amortization of the premiums 
student loan spread analysis on balance sheet the following table analyzes the reported earnings from student loans both on balance sheet and those off balance sheet in securitization trusts

in  and  we earned gross floor income of million basis points  million basis points and million basis points  respectively 
gross floor income is the amount of floor income earned on our on balance sheet portfolio of student loans without giving effect to payments under our floor income contracts  which is discussed in more detail below 
the reduction in gross floor income is due to the increase in short term interest rates 
we believe that we have economically hedged most of the floor income through the sale of floor income contracts  under which we receive an upfront fee and agree to pay the counterparty the floor income earned on a notional amount of student loans 
these contracts do not qualify for accounting hedge treatment and as a result the payments on the floor income contracts are included on the income statement with gains losses on derivative and hedging activities  net rather than in student loan interest income 
for the years ended december   and  net floor income for on balance sheet student loans was million basis points  million basis points and million basis points  respectively 
payments on floor income contracts associated with on balance sheet student loans for the years ended december   and totaled million basis points  million basis points and million basis points  respectively 
in addition to floor income contracts  we also extensively use basis swaps to manage our basis risk associated with interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
these swaps generally do not qualify as accounting hedges and are likewise required to be accounted for in the gains losses on derivative and hedging activities  net line on the income statement 
as a result  they are not considered in the calculation of the cost of funds in the above table 
discussion of the year over year effect of changes in accounting estimates on the on balance sheet student loan spread as discussed in detail and summarized in a table under critical accounting policies and estimates  we periodically update our estimates for changes in the student loan portfolio 
under sfas no 
 these changes in estimates must be reflected in the balance of the student loan from inception 
we have also updated our estimates to reflect programmatic changes in our borrower benefits and private education loan programs and have made modeling refinements to better reflect current and future conditions 
the effects of the changes in estimates on the student loan spread are summarized in the table below years ended december  dollar value basis points dollar value basis points changes in critical accounting estimates effect on private education loan discount borrower benefits total changes in estimates in  we updated our estimates for the qualification of borrower benefits to account for programmatic changes as well as the effect of continued high levels of consolidations 
these updates resulted in a reduction of million or basis points in our borrower benefits reserve for in  based on our ongoing analysis of our private education loan portfolio  we determined that the portfolio was repaying slower than previously estimated  and in response we increased the period for which we amortize student loan discounts resulting in an increase to the unamortized student loan discount balance of million during in response to the continued high rate of consolidation loan activity  we lowered our estimate of the number of stafford borrowers who will eventually qualify for borrower benefits and revised the term over which benefits are expected to be realized 
as a result  we recorded a million reduction in the liability for borrower benefits 
the net effect of these updates to our estimates in was million 
discussion of student loan spread effects of significant events in and there was a record level of consolidation loan activity in the second quarter of caused primarily by ffelp stafford borrowers locking in lower interest rates by consolidating their loans prior to the july interest rate reset for ffelp stafford loans 
in addition  borrowers were permitted for the first time to consolidate their loans while still in school 
this unprecedented volume of consolidation loan requests resulted in a majority of the applications being processed in the third and fourth quarters 
the increase to premium amortization in can mainly be attributed to this surge in consolidation loan activity as we write off the balance of unamortized premiums associated with loans that consolidate away from the company as a current period expense in accordance with sfas no 
as discussed under results of operations net interest income student loans 
in the fourth quarter of  in addition to the consolidation loan activity discussed above  a significant volume of our consolidation loans were consolidated with third party lenders through the direct lending program see lending business segment consolidation loan activity for further discussion 
as discussed above  this also resulted in an increase in student loan premium write offs for loans consolidated with third parties 
conversely  loans lost through consolidation benefit the student loan spread through the write off of borrower benefits reserves associated with these loans 
discussion of student loan spread other year over year fluctuations the decrease in the student loan spread versus the prior year is primarily due to the decrease in gross floor income discussed above 
additionally  higher average balance of consolidation loans as a percentage of the on balance sheet portfolio contributes to downward pressure on the spread 
consolidation loans have lower spreads than other ffelp loans due to the basis point consolidation loan rebate fee  more robust borrower benefits  and higher funding costs due to their longer terms 
these negative effects are partially offset by lower student loan premium amortization due to the extended term and a higher special allowance payment sap yield 
the average balance of consolidation loans grew as a percentage of the average on balance sheet ffelp student loan portfolio from percent in to percent in other factors that impacted the student loan spread include higher spreads on our debt funding student loans as a result of the gse wind down  partially offset by lower borrower benefits costs  and the absence of offset fees on gse financed loans 
the increase in funding costs is due to the replacement of lower cost  primarily short term gse funding with longer term  higher cost funding 
the decrease in borrower benefits costs can be attributed primarily to the write off of borrower benefits reserves due to the significant volume of consolidation loan activity as discussed above 
the negative effects on the spread were partially offset by the percent increase in private education loans in the on balance sheet student loan portfolio 
in addition to the effects of estimate adjustments  the student loan spread decreased by basis points from to this decrease was primarily due to the higher average balance of consolidation loans  lower floor income and higher funding spreads on the debt 
these negative effects were partially offset by the increase in private education loans in the on balance sheet student loan portfolio 
federal and state taxes the company is subject to federal and state income taxes  while the gse was exempt from all state and local income taxes 
our effective tax rate for the years ended december   and was percent  percent and percent  respectively

the permanent differences were a million gain in  a million gain in and a million loss in  the year of adoption of sfas no 
business segments the results of operations of the company s lending and dmo operating segments are presented below 
these defined business segments operate in distinct business environments and are considered reportable segments under sfas no 
based on quantitative thresholds applied to the company s financial statements 
in addition  we provide other complementary products and services  including guarantor and student loan servicing  through smaller operating segments that do not meet such thresholds and are aggregated in the corporate and other reportable segment for financial reporting purposes 
the management reporting process measures the performance of the company s operating segments based on the management structure of the company as well as the methodology used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources 
management  including the company s chief operating decision maker  evaluates the performance of the company s operating segments based on their profitability as measured by core earnings 
accordingly  information regarding the company s reportable segments is provided herein based on core earnings  which are discussed in detail below 
our core earnings are not defined terms within gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
core earnings reflect only current period adjustments to gaap as described below 
unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management reporting and as a result  our management reporting is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution 
the company s operating segments are defined by the products and services they offer or the types of customers they serve  and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by management 
intersegment revenues and expenses are netted within the appropriate financial statement line items consistent with the income statement presentation provided to management 
changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial information 
core earnings are the primary financial performance measures used by management to develop the company s financial plans  track results  and establish corporate performance targets and incentive compensation 
while core earnings are not a substitute for reported results under gaap  the company relies on core earnings in operating its business because core earnings permit management to make meaningful period to period comparisons of the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management 
management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the core business activities of our operating segments 
accordingly  the tables presented below reflect core earnings which is reviewed and utilized by management to manage the business for each of the company s reportable segments

alternative performance measures in accordance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec  we prepare financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in addition to evaluating the company s gaap based financial information  management evaluates the company s business segments under certain non gaap performance measures that we refer to as core earnings for each business segment  and we refer to this information in our presentations with credit rating agencies and lenders 
while core earnings are not a substitute for reported results under gaap  we rely on core earnings to manage each operating segment because we believe these measures provide additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely assessed by management 
our core earnings are the primary financial performance measures used by management to evaluate performance and to allocate resources 
accordingly  financial information is reported to management on a core earnings basis by reportable segment  as these are the measures used regularly by our chief operating decision maker 
our core earnings are used in developing our financial plans and tracking results  and also in establishing corporate performance targets and determining incentive compensation 
management believes this information provides additional insight into the financial performance of the company s core business activities 
our core earnings are not defined terms within gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
core earnings reflect only current period adjustments to gaap as described below 
accordingly  the company s core earnings presentation does not represent another comprehensive basis of accounting 
a more detailed discussion of the differences between gaap and core earnings follows 
limitations of core earnings while gaap provides a uniform  comprehensive basis of accounting  for the reasons described above  management believes that core earnings are an important additional tool for providing a more complete understanding of the company s results of operations 
nevertheless  core earnings are subject to certain general and specific limitations that investors should carefully consider 
for example  as stated above  unlike financial accounting  there is no comprehensive  authoritative guidance for management reporting 
our core earnings are not defined terms within gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
unlike gaap  core earnings reflect only current period adjustments to gaap 
accordingly  the company s core earnings presentation does not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting 
investors  therefore  may not compare our company s performance with that of other financial services companies based upon core earnings 
core earnings results are only meant to supplement gaap results by providing additional information regarding the operational and performance indicators that are most closely used by management  the company s board of directors  rating agencies and lenders to assess performance 
other limitations arise from the specific adjustments that management makes to gaap results to derive core earnings results 
for example  in reversing the unrealized gains and losses that result from sfas no 
on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment  as well as on derivatives that do qualify but are in part ineffective because they are not perfect hedges  we focus on the long term economic effectiveness of those instruments relative to the underlying hedged item and isolate the effects of interest rate volatility  changing credit spreads and changes in our stock price on the fair value of such instruments during the period 
under gaap  the effects of these factors on the fair value of the derivative instruments but not on the underlying hedged item tend to show more volatility in the short term 
while our presentation of our results on a managed basis provides important information regarding the performance of our managed portfolio  a limitation of this presentation is that we are presenting the ongoing spread income on loans that have been sold to a trust managed by us 
while we believe that our managed basis presentation presents the economic substance of our managed loan portfolio  it understates earnings volatility from securitization gains 
our core earnings results exclude certain floor income  which is real cash income  from our reported results and therefore may understate earnings in certain periods 
management s financial planning and valuation of operating results  however  does not take into account floor income because of its inherent uncertainty  except when it is economically hedged through floor income contracts

core earnings reflect only current period adjustments to gaap  as described in the more detailed discussion of the differences between gaap and core earnings that follows  which includes further detail on each specific adjustments required to reconcile our core earnings segment presentation to our gaap earnings 
securitization accounting under gaap  certain securitization transactions in our lending operating segment are accounted for as sales of assets 
under core earnings for the lending operating segment  we present all securitization transactions on a managed basis as long term non recourse financings 
the upfront gains on sale from securitization transactions as well as ongoing servicing and securitization revenue presented in accordance with gaap are excluded from core earnings and are replaced by the interest income  provisions for loan losses  and interest expense as they are earned or incurred on the securitization loans 
we also exclude transactions with our off balance sheet trusts from core earnings as they are considered intercompany transactions on a managed basis 
the following table summarizes core earnings securitization adjustments for the lending operating segment the years ended december   and years ended december  core earnings securitization adjustments net interest income on securitized loans  after provisions for losses gains on student loan securitizations servicing and securitization revenue intercompany transactions with off balance sheet trusts total core earnings securitization adjustments derivative accounting core earnings exclude periodic unrealized gains and losses arising primarily in our lending operating segment  and to a lesser degree in our corporate and other reportable segment  that are caused primarily by the one sided mark to market derivative valuations prescribed by sfas no 
on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment under gaap 
under core earnings  we recognize the economic effect of these hedges  which generally results in any cash paid or received being recognized ratably as an expense or revenue over the hedged item s life 
core earnings also exclude the gain or loss on equity forward contracts that under sfas no 
 are required to be accounted for as derivatives and are marked to market through earnings 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria  as specified by sfas no 
 are met 
we believe that our derivatives are effective economic hedges  and as such  are a critical element of our interest rate risk management strategy 
however  some of our derivatives  primarily floor income contracts  certain eurodollar futures contracts and certain basis swaps and equity forward contracts discussed in detail below  do not qualify for hedge treatment as defined by sfas no 
 and the stand alone derivative must be marked to market in the income statement with no consideration for the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged item 
gains losses on derivative and hedging activities  net are primarily caused by interest rate volatility  changing credit spreads and changes in our stock price during the period as well as the volume and term of derivatives not receiving hedge treatment 
our floor income contracts are written options which must meet more stringent requirements than other hedging relationships to achieve hedge effectiveness under sfas no 
specifically  our floor income contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment because the paydown of principal of the student loans underlying the floor income embedded in those student loans does not exactly match the change in the notional amount of our written floor income contracts 
under sfas no 
 the upfront payment is deemed a liability and changes in fair value are recorded through income throughout the life of the contract 
the change in the value of floor income contracts is primarily caused by changing interest rates that cause the amount of floor income earned on the underlying student loans and paid to the counterparties to vary 
this is economically offset by the change in value of the student loan portfolio  including our retained interests  earning floor income but that offsetting change in value is not recognized under sfas no 
we believe the floor income contracts are economic hedges because they effectively fix the amount of floor income earned over the contract period  thus eliminating the timing and uncertainty that changes in interest rates can have on floor income for that period 
prior to sfas no 
 we accounted for floor income contracts as hedges and amortized the upfront cash compensation ratably over the lives of the contracts 
basis swaps are used to convert floating rate debt from one interest rate index to another to better match the interest rate characteristics of the assets financed by that debt 
we primarily use basis swaps to change the index of our fixed rate and libor based debt to better match the cash flows of our student loan assets that are primarily indexed to a commercial paper  prime or treasury bill index 
sfas no 
requires that when using basis swaps  the change in the cash flows of the hedge effectively offset both the change in the cash flows of the asset and the change in the cash flows of the liability 
our basis swaps hedge variable interest rate risk  however they do not meet this effectiveness test because our ffelp student loans can earn at either a variable or a fixed interest rate depending on market interest rates 
we also have basis swaps that do not meet the sfas no 
effectiveness test that economically hedge off balance sheet instruments 
as a result  under gaap these swaps are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in the income statement 
generally  a decrease in current interest rates and the respective forward interest rate curves results in an unrealized loss related to our written floor income contracts which is offset by an increase in the value of the economically hedged student loans 
this increase is not recognized in income 
we will experience unrealized gains losses related to our basis swaps if the two underlying indices and related forward curve do not move in parallel 
under sfas no 
 equity forward contracts that allow a net settlement option either in cash or the company s stock are required to be accounted for as derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  we account for our equity forward contracts as derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
and mark them to market through earnings 
they do not qualify as effective sfas no 
hedges  as a requirement to achieve hedge accounting is the hedged item must impact net income and the settlement of these contracts through the purchase of our own stock does not impact net income 
the table below quantifies the adjustments for derivative accounting under sfas no 
on our net income for the years ended december   and  when compared with the accounting principles employed in all years prior to the sfas no 
implementation

therefore  we exclude such income from core earnings when it is not economically hedged 
we employ derivatives  primarily floor income contracts and futures  to economically hedge floor income 
as discussed above in derivative accounting  these derivatives do not qualify as effective accounting hedges  and therefore  under gaap  they are marked to market through the gains losses on derivative and hedging activities  net line on the income statement with no offsetting gain or loss recorded for the economically hedged items 
for core earnings  we reverse the fair value adjustments on the floor income contracts and futures economically hedging floor income and include the amortization of net premiums received net of eurodollar futures contracts realized gains or losses in income

lending business segment in our lending operating segment  we originate and acquire federally guaranteed student loans  which are administered by ed  and private education loans  which are not federally guaranteed 
the majority of our private education loans is made in conjunction with a ffelp stafford loan and as a result is marketed through the same marketing channels as ffelp stafford loans 
while ffelp student loans and private education loans have different overall risk profiles due to the federal guarantee of the ffelp student loans  they share many of the same characteristics such as similar repayment terms  the same marketing channel and sales force  and are originated and serviced on the same servicing platform 
finally  where possible  the borrower receives a single bill for both the federally guaranteed and privately underwritten loans 
the earnings growth in our lending operating segment is a product of the growth in our managed portfolio of student loans and the earning spread on those loans 
in  the managed portfolio grew by percent to billion at december  as a result of receiving ep designation from ed  approximately percent of our managed ffelp student loans are percent guaranteed by the federal government declining to percent guaranteed after july  and as such  represent high quality assets with minimal credit risk 
at december   our managed ffelp student loan portfolio was billion or percent of our total managed student loans 
trends in the lending business segment the growth in our lending operating segment has been largely driven by the steady growth in the demand for post secondary education in the united states over the last decade 
this growth is evident in the billion of student loans we originated or acquired in through our normal acquisition channels  a percent increase over the billion of student loans acquired in our normal acquisition channels exclude loans acquired in conjunction with business combinations 
in  we originated billion of student loans through our preferred channel  an increase of percent over the billion of student loans originated through our preferred channel in we expect the growth in the demand for post secondary education to continue in the future due to a number of factors 
first  the college age population will continue to grow as ed predicts that the college age population will increase approximately percent from to second  we project an increase in non traditional students those not attending college directly from high school and adult education 
third  tuition costs have risen percent for four year public institutions and percent for four year private institutions on a constant  inflation adjusted basis since the academic year ay and are projected to continue to rise at a pace greater than inflation 
management believes that these factors will drive growth in education financing well into the next decade 
on march   the company announced that it extended both its jpmorgan chase and bank one student loan and loan purchase commitments to august  this comprehensive agreement provided for the dissolution of the joint venture between chase and sallie mae that had been making student loans under the chase brand since and resolved a lawsuit filed by chase on february  jpmorgan chase will continue to sell substantially all student loans to the company whether made under the chase or bank one brand that are originated or serviced on the company s platforms 
in addition  the agreement provides that substantially all chase branded education loans made for the july  to june  academic year and future loans made to these borrowers will be sold to the company  including certain loans that are not originated or serviced on sallie mae platforms 
this agreement permits jpmorgan chase to compete with the company in the student loan marketplace and releases the company from its commitment to market the bank one and chase brands on campus 
the company will continue to support its school customers through its comprehensive set of products and services  including its loan origination and servicing platforms  its family of lending brands and strategic lending partners 
over the past three years  we have experienced a surge in consolidation loan activity as a result of historically low interest rates and aggressive marketing in the industry which has substantially changed the composition of our student loan portfolio 
consolidation loans earn a lower yield than ffelp stafford loans due primarily to the basis point consolidation loan rebate fee 
this negative impact is somewhat mitigated by higher sap spreads  the longer average life of consolidation loans and the greater potential to earn floor income 
since interest rates on consolidation loans are fixed to term for the borrower  older consolidation loans with higher borrower rates can earn floor income over an extended period of time 
in both and  substantially all floor income was earned on consolidation loans 
the hea requires lenders to rebate floor income on all ffelp loans originated after april   so this benefit will gradually decrease over time 
during  billion of ffelp stafford loans in our managed loan portfolio consolidated either with us billion or with other lenders billion 
the net result of consolidation activity in was a net portfolio loss of million 
consolidation loans now represent over percent of our on balance sheet federally guaranteed student loan portfolio and over percent of our managed federally guaranteed portfolio 
during  the surge in consolidations was abetted by new industry practices 
first  borrowers  who elected to have their consolidation loans prematurely enter repayment  were permitted for the first time to consolidate their loans while still in school  due to an interpretation of the hea that allows borrowers to voluntarily transfer into repayment status before graduation 
previously  borrowers typically only consolidated ffelp stafford loans upon graduation 
second  a significant volume of our consolidation loans was consolidated with third party lenders using the direct lending program as a pass through entity to circumvent the statutory prohibition on the ffelp reconsolidation of consolidation loans 
the hea eliminates this practice by july   but we are working with others in the industry to end it before june   because we believe that this practice is improper and not permitted by current regulations 
this practice contributed to a net run off of million in our portfolio in the fourth quarter of  which will continue at a high rate until this practice ceases 
to meet the increasing cost of higher education  students and parents have turned to alternative sources of education financing outside of the ffelp 
a large and growing source of this supplemental education financing is provided by private education loans  for which we are the largest provider 
these loans are primarily originated through campus based programs but this channel has recently been supplemented by our direct to consumer private education loans channel 
the private education loan portfolio grew by percent in to billion and now represents percent of our managed student loan portfolio  up from percent in private education loans consist of two general types those that meet the needs of borrowers at higher education schools and other title iv eligible schools  and those that are used to meet the needs of students in alternative learning programs such as career training  distance learning and lifelong learning programs 
unlike ffelp loans  private education loans are subject to the full credit risk of the borrower 
we manage this additional risk through clearly defined loan underwriting standards and a combination of higher interest rates and loan origination fees that compensate us for the higher risk 
as a result  we earn higher spreads on private education loans than on ffelp loans 
private education loans will continue to be an important driver of future earnings growth as the demand for post secondary education grows and costs increase much faster than increases in federal loan limits 
we also originate lesser quantities of mortgage and consumer loans with the intent of immediately selling the majority of the mortgage loans 
mortgage and consumer loan originations and the mortgage loan portfolio we hold were nine percent and one percent  respectively  of total loan originations and total loans outstanding as of and for the year ended december  student loan spread an important performance measure closely monitored by management is the student loan spread 
the student loan spread is the difference between the income earned on the student loan assets and the interest paid on the debt funding those assets 
a number of factors can affect the overall student loan spread such as the mix of student loans in the portfolio  with consolidation loans having the lowest spread and private education loans having the highest spread  the premiums paid  borrower fees charged and capitalized costs incurred to acquire student loans which impact the spread through subsequent amortization  the type and level of borrower benefits programs  the level of floor income  and when considering the core earnings managed spread  the amount of floor income eligible loans that have been hedged through floor income contracts  and funding and hedging costs 
the student loan spread is highly susceptible to liquidity  funding and interest rate risk 
these risks are discussed separately at liquidity and capital resources and in the risk factors discussion at the front of the document

years ended december  managed basis student loan yield consolidation loan rebate fees offset fees borrower benefits premium and discount amortization managed basis student loan net yield managed basis student loan cost of funds managed basis student loan spread average balances on balance sheet student loans off balance sheet student loans managed student loans discussion of the year over year effect of changes in accounting estimates on the managed student loan spread as discussed in detail and summarized in a table at critical accounting policies and estimates  we periodically update our estimates for changes in the student loan portfolio 
under sfas no 
 these changes in estimates must be reflected in the balance from inception of the student loan 
we have also updated our estimates to reflect programmatic changes in our borrower benefits and private education loan programs and have made modeling refinements to better reflect current and future conditions 
the effects of the changes in estimates are summarized in the table below years ended december  dollar value basis points dollar value basis points changes in critical accounting estimates effect on premium discount ffelp stafford and consolidation loans private education loans total effect on premium discount borrower benefits total changes in estimates in  we updated our estimates for the qualification for borrower benefits to account for programmatic changes as well as the effect of continued high levels of consolidations 
these updates resulted in a reduction of million or basis points in the borrower benefits reserve for versus in  we increased our estimates of the average life of our ffelp stafford and consolidation loan programs to recognize the shifting of the portfolio to consolidation loans that have longer lives 
the net effect of these changes was a million adjustment to increase the unamortized student loan premium 
the difference between the effect for on balance sheet and off balance sheet was primarily due to a refinement in our estimates for off balance sheet loans that did not have the same effect on balance sheet and to the different mix of ffelp stafford and consolidation loans on balance sheet versus the mix on a managed basis 
in  based on our ongoing analysis of our managed private education loan portfolio  we determined that the portfolio was repaying at a slower rate than previously estimated 
in response  we increased the period for which we amortize student loan discounts resulting in an increase to the unamortized student loan discount balance of million during additionally  the continued high rate of consolidation loan activity results in fewer stafford borrowers qualifying for borrower benefits 
in response to this trend  we lowered our estimate of the number of stafford borrowers who will eventually qualify for borrower benefits and revised the term over which benefits are expected to be realized 
as a result  we recorded a million reduction in the liability for borrower benefits during the net effect of these updates to our estimates in was a million or basis point increase in the managed student loan spread 
discussion of managed basis student loan spread effects of significant events in and there was a record level of consolidation loan activity in the second quarter of caused primarily by ffelp stafford borrowers locking in lower interest rates by consolidating their loans prior to the july interest rate reset for ffelp stafford loans 
in addition  borrowers were permitted for the first time to consolidate their loans while still in school 
this unprecedented volume of consolidation loan requests resulted in a majority of the applications being processed in the third quarter 
the increase to premium amortization in can mainly be attributed to this surge in consolidation loan activity as we write off the balance of unamortized premiums associated with loans that consolidate away from the company as a current period expense in accordance with sfas no 
as discussed under results of operations net interest income student loans 
also  in the second half of  a significant volume of our consolidation loans was reconsolidated with third party lenders through the fdlp see lending business segment consolidation loan activity for further discussion of this practice  resulting in an increase in student loan premium write offs 
reconsolidation of student loans does benefit the student loan spread to a lesser extent through the write off of borrower benefits reserves associated with these loans 
discussion of managed basis student loan spread other year over year fluctuations the decrease in the student loan spread versus  exclusive of the changes in estimates disclosed above  is primarily due to the higher average balance of consolidation loans as a percentage of the managed portfolio 
consolidation loans have lower spreads than other ffelp loans due to the basis point consolidation loan rebate fee  higher qualification rates for borrower benefits  and higher funding costs due to their longer terms 
these negative effects are partially offset by lower student loan premium amortization due to the extended term and a higher sap yield 
the average balance of consolidation loans grew as a percentage of the average managed ffelp student loan portfolio from percent in to percent in in  our managed student loan spread was impacted by higher spreads on our debt funding student loans  which was partially offset by the absence of offset fees 
the increase in funding costs is due to the replacement of lower cost  primarily short term gse funding with longer term  higher cost funding in connection with the gse wind down 
the student loan spread benefited from the increase in the average balance of managed private education loans as a percentage of the average managed student loan portfolio from percent in to percent in private education loans are subject to credit risk and therefore earn higher spreads which averaged percent for the year ended december  versus a spread of percent for the managed guaranteed student loan portfolio  excluding the impact from the update to our estimates for the qualification for borrower benefits

these factors more than offset the increase in consolidation loans eligible to earn fixed rate floor income 
as discussed in more detail under liquidity and capital resources securitization activities  when we securitize a portfolio of student loans  we estimate the future fixed rate embedded floor income earned on off balance sheet student loans using a discounted cash flow option pricing model and recognize the fair value of such cash flows in the initial gain on sale and subsequent valuations of the residual interest 
variable rate embedded floor income is recognized as earned in servicing and securitization revenue

all consolidation loans are eligible to earn floor income  and over time we have sold floor income contracts to hedge the potential floor income from specifically identified consolidation loans 
the sale of the floor income contracts did not anticipate the reconsolidation of consolidation loans and as a consequence we are losing higher rate consolidation loans that underlie the contracts 
as a result  as of december   the notional amount of floor income contracts roughly equals the outstanding balance of the consolidation loans that the floor income contracts were sold against 
recently passed legislation discontinues reconsolidation june   although there is a chance it may be ended sooner 
since we are at parity between the loans and contracts at december   loans reconsolidating in would potentially put us in an oversold position during related to our floor income contracts 
however  we do not believe that the volume of reconsolidation will create a material oversold position vis vis the billion of consolidation loans now hedged by floor income contracts at december  the following table presents a projection of the average managed balance of consolidation loans whose fixed rate floor income has already been economically hedged through floor income contracts for the period january  to march  these loans are both on and off balance sheet and the related hedges do not qualify under sfas no

dollars in billions average balance of consolidation loans whose floor income is economically hedged managed basis private education loans allowance for private education loan losses change in accounting estimate to the allowance for loan losses and the recognition of accrued interest income for private education loans we maintain an allowance for loan losses at an amount sufficient to absorb losses inherent in our private education loan portfolio at the reporting date based on a projection of probable net credit losses 
the maturing of our private education loan portfolios has provided us with more historical data on borrower default behavior such that we now analyze those portfolios to determine the effects that the various stages of delinquency have on borrower default behavior and ultimate charge off 
as a result  in the second quarter of  we changed our estimate of the allowance for loan losses for our managed loan portfolio using a migration analysis of delinquent and current accounts 
a migration analysis is a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a loan receivable may progress through the various delinquency stages and ultimately charge off 
this is a widely used reserving methodology in the consumer finance industry 
previously  we calculated the allowance for private education loan losses by estimating the probable losses in the portfolio based primarily on loan characteristics and where pools of loans were in their life with less emphasis on current delinquency status of the loan 
also  in our prior methodology for calculating the allowance  some loss rates were based on proxies and extrapolations of ffelp loan loss data 
we also used a migration analysis to revise our estimates pertaining to our non accrual policy for interest income 
under the new methodology  we estimate the amount of uncollectible accrued interest on private education loans and write it off against current period interest income 
under our prior methodology  private education loans continued to accrue interest  including in periods of forbearance  until they were charged off  at which time the loans were placed on non accrual status and all previously accrued interest was reversed against income in the month of charge off 
the allowance for loan losses provided for a portion of the probable losses in accrued interest receivable prior to charge off 
this change in reserving methodology has been accounted for as a change in estimate in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
the effect of this change in estimate was to increase the value of the allowance by million and to reduce student loan interest income for the estimate of uncollectible accrued interest receivable by million 
on the income statement  adjustments to the allowance are recorded through the provisions for loan losses whereas adjustments to accrued interest are recorded in interest income 
on a managed basis  we decreased the allowance for loan losses by million and reduced student loan interest income by million for uncollectible accrued interest 
we continue to gain experience in analyzing our private education loan portfolios and as a result  we have developed additional data to better estimate the amount of recoveries on defaulted loans 
during the third quarter of  we changed our methodology for estimating the amount of charged off student loans that will ultimately be recovered  which resulted in a million decrease in the value of the allowance through the provisions for loan losses 
on a managed basis  we decreased the allowance for loan losses by million to recognize the effect of this change 
the following table provides a summary of the income statement impact of the change in accounting estimate and change in recovery methodology on the allowance for loan losses 
on balance sheet off balance sheet managed basis impact on provisions impact of change in allowance estimate impact of change in recovery estimate total impact from changes in estimates the difference in the impact of the change in estimate on the allowance for loan losses between our on balance sheet and our managed results is due to the difference in the mix of private education loans on and off balance sheet 
certain loan types with higher expected default rates  such as career training and those loan programs targeted to borrowers with lower fico scores  have not yet been securitized and as such the on balance sheet portfolio contains loans with higher delinquency rates 
because the required allowance under the new methodology is more directly tied to the current status of the portfolio  the on balance sheet portfolio reserve requirements increased while at the same time the off balance sheet portfolio reserve requirements decreased with the net effect being a decrease in the managed basis allowance 
the difference in the composition of our on balance sheet and off balance sheet portfolios also caused the disparity in the impact of the change in recovery methodology for loans on balance sheet versus off balance sheet 
the on balance sheet portfolio has higher expected gross charge offs and was therefore more heavily affected by the change in estimate on the related expected recoveries 
during the year there is seasonality in the provisions for loan losses that is primarily driven by the seasonality of loans entering repayment 
the majority of loans typically enter repayment in the second and fourth quarters 
this increase in loans entering repayment often leads to a near term increase in early stage delinquencies or forbearance usage in the first and third quarters for the affected borrowers  which in turn leads to a spike in the provisions for those quarters 
therefore  all other factors being equal  the provisions for loan losses will be higher in the first and third quarters 
activity in the allowance for private education loan losses as discussed in detail under critical accounting policies and estimates  the provisions for student loan losses represents the periodic expense of maintaining an allowance sufficient to absorb losses  net of recoveries  inherent in the portfolio of private education loans

when we securitize private education loans  we no longer legally own the loans and they are accounted for off balance sheet 
for our managed presentation in the table above  we reduce the on balance sheet allowance for amounts previously provided and then provide for these loans in the off balance sheet section with the total of both on and off balance sheet residing in the managed presentation 
when private education loans in the majority of our securitized trusts become days delinquent  we typically exercise our contingent call option to repurchase these loans at par value out of the trust and record a loss for the difference in the par value paid and the fair market value of the loan at the time of purchase 
if these loans reach the day delinquency  a charge off for the remaining balance of the loan is triggered 
on a managed basis  the losses recorded under gaap for loans repurchased at day are reversed and the full amount is charged off at day the off balance sheet allowance is increasing as more loans are securitized but is lower than the on balance sheet percentage when measured as a percentage of ending loans in repayment because of the different mix of loans on balance sheet and off balance sheet  as described above 
additionally  a larger percentage of the off balance sheet loan borrowers are still in school status and not required to make payments on their loans 
once repayment begins  the allowance requirements increase to reflect the increased risk of loss as loans enter repayment 
managed basis private education loan loss allowance discussion the decrease in the allowance as a percentage of ending loans in repayment is due to the change in methodology for estimating the allowance for loan loss primarily by reducing the loss confirmation period  and to the increase in the period of time for estimating future recoveries discussed in detail above 
the year over year allowance on a managed basis increased by million from to  exclusive of the adjustments related to these changes in estimate and methodology 
this increase was primarily driven by the percent year over year increase in average loans in repayment 
as a result of the change in the loan loss and recovery estimates discussed above  the allowance as a percentage of ending loans in repayment decreased from percent to percent  and consequently the year over year growth rate in the provision is less than the growth rate in the portfolio 
the increase in the provision for managed private education loans of million from to is primarily due to the billion increase in managed private education loans that have transitioned to out of school status over the prior year 
for the year ended december   private education loan charge offs increased by million over the prior year  which is due primarily to the continued growth and maturity of loans in repayment 
as discussed further below  while the delinquency and forbearance amounts fluctuate from quarter to quarter  they will increase with the growth in the repayment portfolio 
we utilize our debt management operations to minimize charge offs in our own portfolio and to increase recoveries on charged off loans 
the allowance as a percentage of loans in repayment decreased year over year from percent to percent 
this reduction is primarily attributable to updates in our default assumptions in the third quarter of delinquencies the table below presents our private education loan delinquency trends as of december   and delinquencies have the potential to adversely impact earnings through increased servicing and collection costs in the event the delinquent accounts charge off

the period of delinquency is based on the number of days scheduled payments are contractually past due 
forbearance managed basis private education loans private education loans are made to parent and student borrowers by our lender partners in accordance with our underwriting policies 
these loans generally supplement federally guaranteed student loans  which are subject to federal lending caps 
private education loans are not guaranteed or insured against any loss of principal or interest 
traditional student borrowers use the proceeds of these loans to obtain higher education  which increases the likelihood of obtaining employment at higher income levels than would be available without the additional education 
as a result  the borrowers repayment capability improves between the time the loan is made and the time they enter the post education work force 
we generally allow the loan repayment period on traditional private education loans  except those generated by our slm financial subsidiary  to begin six to nine months after the student leaves school 
this provides the borrower time to obtain a job to service his or her debt 
for borrowers that need more time or experience other hardships  we permit additional delays in payment or partial payments both referred to as forbearances when we believe additional time will improve the borrower s ability to repay the loan 
forbearance is also granted to borrowers who may experience temporary hardship after entering repayment  when we believe that it will increase the likelihood of ultimate collection of the loan 
such forbearance is only granted within established guidelines and is closely monitored for compliance 
our policy does not grant any reduction in the repayment obligation principal or interest but does allow the borrower to stop or reduce monthly payments for an agreed period of time 
when a loan that was delinquent prior to receiving forbearance  ends forbearance and re enters repayment  that loan is considered current 
forbearance is used most heavily immediately after the loan enters repayment 
as indicated in the tables below showing the composition and status of the managed private education loan portfolio by number of months aged from the first date of repayment  the percentage of loans in forbearance decreases the longer the loans have been in repayment 
at december   loans in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance is percent for loans that have been in repayment one to twenty four months 
the percentage drops to percent for loans that have been in repayment more than months 
approximately percent of our managed private education loans in forbearance have been in repayment less than months 
these borrowers are essentially extending their grace period as they transition to the workforce 
forbearance continues to be a positive collection tool for the private education loans as we believe it can provide the borrower with sufficient time to obtain employment and income to support his or her obligation 
we consider the potential impact of forbearance in the determination of the loan loss reserves

the year over year increase in forbearance as a percentage of loans in repayment and forbearance is due primarily to the increase in collections staffing in response to the seasonality of the loans entering repayment 
this increase in staffing has resulted in an increase in cash collections  lower delinquency percentages  as well as an increase in the use of forbearance for those student borrowers that are in need of short term forbearance in order to make timely payments as they have recently graduated 
on a percentage basis  the figures are within management expectations 
the table below stratifies the portfolio of managed private education loans in forbearance by the cumulative number of months the borrower has used forbearance as of the dates indicated

see other related events and information reauthorization for a detailed discussion on the reauthorization legislation and its impact on the company 
the reauthorization legislation reduces the level of default insurance to percent from percent effectively increasing risk sharing from two percent to three percent on loans disbursed after july  for lenders without ep designation 
furthermore  the reauthorization legislation reduces the default insurance paid to lenders servicers with the ep designation to percent from percent on claims filed on or after july  as a result of the amended insurance levels  we established a risk sharing allowance as of december  for an estimate of losses on ffelp student loans based on the one percent reduction in default insurance for servicers with the ep designation 
the reserve was established using a migration analysis similar to that described above for the private education loans before applying the appropriate risk sharing percentage 
as a result  for the year ended december   we provided for additional reserves of million for on balance sheet ffelp loans and million for managed ffelp loans

such loans totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and respectively 
the increase in ffelp stafford and other consolidations to third parties is primarily due to some ffelp lenders consolidating these loans using the fdlp as a pass through entity to circumvent the statutory prohibition on the ffelp reconsolidation of ffelp consolidation loans 
recently passed legislation eliminates this practice by june   but we are working with others in the industry to end it before june  because we believe that it is improper and not permitted by current regulations 
if this practice is not ended before june   we expect to experience additional run off of consolidation loans to third parties through such time 
operating expenses the following table summarizes the components of operating expenses for our lending business segment for the years ended december   and years ended december  sales and originations servicing and information technology total operating expenses loss on gse debt extinguishment and defeasance operating expenses for our lending operating segment include non capitalizable costs incurred to acquire student loans and service our managed student loan portfolio  as well as other selling  general and administrative expenses 
the million loss in relates to the repurchase and defeasance of approximately billion of gse debt in connection with the wind down of the gse 
versus operating expenses for the year ended december   increased by percent to million versus million in the prior year  exclusive of the loss on gse debt extinguishment and defeasance 
the increase is due to increased sales and marketing costs related to the consolidation loan program  new private education loan initiatives and the launch of our direct to consumer initiative  tuition answer 
operating expenses were also higher due to a full year of expenses of sales and marketing personnel from southwest and slfa  acquired in the fourth quarter of the million increase in servicing and information technology expenses is consistent with the growth in borrowers 
versus operating expenses for the year ended december   exclusive of the loss on gse debt extinguishment and defeasance discussed above  were relatively flat at million versus million in debt management operations dmo business segment through the six operating units that comprise our dmo operating segment  we provide a wide range of accounts receivable and collections services including student loan default aversion services  defaulted student loan portfolio management services  contingency collections services for student loans and other asset classes  and accounts receivable management and collection for purchased portfolios of receivables that are delinquent or have been charged off by their original creditors as well as sub performing and non performing mortgage loans 
in our dmo segment  nearly half of our revenues are still earned from our student loan contingency collection fee business in which we provide default management services to guarantor agencies  colleges and universities and ed 
in recent years  we have diversified our dmo contingency revenue stream away from student loans  mainly through the acquisition of afs in and grp in these acquisitions also diversified our revenue from purely contingency fee collections to purchased paper collections 
as a result  student loan contingency fees contributed percent of total dmo revenue in  versus percent in the private sector collections industry is highly fragmented with few large public companies and a large number of small scale privately held companies 
the collections industry is highly competitive with credit card collections being the most competitive in both contingency collections and purchased paper activities 
we are responding to these competitive challenges through enhanced servicing efficiencies and by continuing to build on customer relationships through value added services 
in the purchased receivables business  we focus on a variety of consumer debt types with emphasis on charged off credit card receivables and distressed mortgage receivables 
we purchase these portfolios at a discount to their face value  and then use both our internal collections operations coupled with third party collection agencies to maximize the recovery on these receivables 
a major success factor in the purchased receivables business is the ability to effectively price the portfolios 
we conduct both quantitative and qualitative analysis to appropriately price each portfolio to yield a return consistent with dmo financial targets 
we account for our investments in charged off receivables in accordance with the aicpa s statement of position sop  accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
under this standard  we establish static pools of relatively homogeneous accounts and initially record them at fair value 
under sop  the yield that may be accreted as interest income on such loans is limited to the excess of our estimate of undiscounted expected principal  interest and other cash flows from the loan over our initial investment in the loan 
we recognize income each month based on each static pool s effective interest rate 
subsequent increases in estimated future cash flows are recognized prospectively through a yield adjustment over the remaining life of the static pool 
decreases in estimated future cash flows to be collected are recognized as an impairment expense 
we record impairments to purchased receivable assets when the actual yield on a pool of portfolios is less than the expected yield based on the cash flows generated by the pool 
the pools consist of portfolios of like kind assets

on december   we acquired an additional percent ownership stake in afs  increasing our ownership to percent 
the million increase in dmo revenue for the year ended december  over can be primarily attributed to the year over year growth in the purchased paper businesses of afs acquired in september and to revenue generated by grp 
contingency fee revenue increased by million  or percent  to million for the year ended december  versus the year ago period 
the year over year growth in contingency fee revenue was primarily driven by the addition of fees earned from state tax collections and by the growth in contingent fee revenues from non student loan asset classes 
the rapid growth in consolidation loan activity has had a negative impact on our student loan contingency collection business 
when a borrower consolidates a ffelp stafford loan  the borrower is effectively refinancing his or her stafford loan to a longer term at a fixed interest rate  which significantly reduces the borrower s monthly payment 
the overall effect of the record consolidation loan activity is lower industry wide student loan defaults and lower contingency collection inventory 
the recently passed hea reduces fees paid for collections via loan consolidation and also puts a cap on collections for loan consolidations 
these fee reductions will also negatively impact student loan contingency fees going forward 
purchased paper non mortgage years ended december  face value of purchases purchase price of face value purchased gross cash collections gcc collections revenue of gcc carrying value of purchases afs was purchased in september prior to this acquisition  the company was not in the purchased paper business 
the amount of face value of purchases in any quarter is a function of a combination of factors including the amount of receivables available for purchase in the marketplace  average age of each portfolio  the asset class of the receivables  and competition in the marketplace 
as a result  the percentage of principal purchased will vary from quarter to quarter 
the decrease in purchase paper revenue as a percentage of gcc can primarily be attributed to the increase in new portfolio purchases in the second half of typically  revenue recognition based on a portfolio s effective interest rate is a lower percentage of cash collections in the early stages of servicing a portfolio 
purchased paper mortgage properties year ended december  face value of purchases collections revenue collateral value of purchases purchase price of collateral value carrying value of purchases grp was purchased in august prior to this acquisition  the company was not in the mortgage purchased paper business 
the purchase price for sub performing and non performing mortgage loans is generally determined as a percentage of the underlying collateral 
fluctuations in the purchase price as a percentage of collateral value can be caused by a number of factors including the percentage of second mortgages in the portfolio and the level of private mortgage insurance associated with particular assets

years ended december  contingency contingency student loans contingency other total operating expenses operating expenses for the dmo business segment for the years ended december   and totaled years ended december  total operating expenses operating expenses increased by million  or percent  to million for the year ended december  a significant portion of the increase is attributable to the inclusion of a full year of afs expenses and grp expenses since the acquisition on august  the increase is also attributable to the growth in contingency revenue and accounts serviced  as a high percentage of dmo expenses are variable which contributes to our stable margins 
we continue to make substantial investments in the infrastructure of the dmo business to accommodate current and future growth  and we believe this investment will provide significant operating efficiencies in the future

liquidity and capital resources except in the case of acquisitions  which are discussed separately  our dmo and corporate and other business segments are not capital intensive businesses and as such a minimal amount of debt and equity capital is allocated to these segments 
therefore  the following liquidity and capital resource discussion is concentrated on our lending business segment 
we depend on the debt capital markets to support our business plan 
we have developed deep and diverse funding sources to ensure continued access to funding now that the gse has been dissolved 
our biggest funding challenge going forward is to maintain cost effective liquidity to fund the growth in the managed portfolio of student loans as well as to refinance previously securitized loans when borrowers choose to refinance their loans through a consolidation loan with the company 
at the same time  we must maintain earnings spreads by controlling interest rate risk 
our main source of funding is student loan securitizations and we have built a highly liquid market for such financings as evidenced by the billion in student loans securitized in twelve transactions in  and billion in thirteen transactions  including the amount funded through our asset backed commercial paper program abcp transaction in we are the largest issuer in the student loan asset backed sector 
ffelp securitizations are unique securities in the asset backed market and are backed by student loans with an explicit guarantee on percent of principal and interest 
this guarantee is subject to service compliance and the amount guaranteed will be lowered to percent after july  through legislation see other related events and information reauthorization 
as evidenced by the volume of the past three years  we have built a highly liquid and deep market for student loan backed securities by developing an investor base worldwide 
securitizations now comprise percent of our financing  versus percent at december  in addition to securitizations  we also significantly increased and diversified our sources of funds through the issuance of billion in slm corporation term  unsecured debt in in and  we strategically introduced several new slm corporation long term debt structures that further diversify our funding sources and substantially increased our fixed income investor base 
in total  at december   on balance sheet debt  exclusive of on balance sheet securitizations and secured indentured trusts  totaled billion versus billion at december  liquidity at slm corporation is important to enable us to effectively fund our student loan acquisitions  to meet maturing debt obligations  and to fund operations 
the following table details our sources of liquidity and the available capacity at december  december  available capacity sources of liquidity sources of primary liquidity unrestricted cash and investments commercial paper and bank lines of credit abcp total sources of primary liquidity stand by liquidity unencumbered ffelp student loans total sources of primary and stand by liquidity we believe that our unencumbered ffelp student loan portfolio provides an additional source of potential or stand by liquidity because the maturation of the government guaranteed securitization marketplace has created a wide and deep marketplace for such transactions  and the whole loan sale market can provide a source of stand by liquidity 
in addition  we have million of investments at december  on our balance sheet that has not been included in the above table as it is pledged as collateral related to certain derivative positions 
in addition to liquidity  a major objective when financing our business is to minimize interest rate risk by matching the interest rate and reset characteristics of our managed assets and liabilities  generally on a pooled basis  to the extent practicable 
in this process we use derivative financial instruments extensively to reduce our interest rate and foreign currency exposure 
this interest rate risk management helps us to stabilize our student loan spread in various and changing interest rate environments

the holders of the beneficial interests issued by the special purpose entity are not constrained from pledging or exchanging their interests 
in all of our securitizations  we retain the right to receive cash flows from the student loans and reserve accounts in excess of the amounts needed to pay servicing  derivative costs if any  other fees  and the principal and interest on the bonds backed by the student loans 
the investors of the securitization trusts have no recourse to the company s other assets should there be a failure of the securities backed by student loans to pay when due 
some of our securitizations meet the requirements for gaap sale treatment through a two step sale to a qualifying special purpose entity qspe according to the criteria of sfas no 
under these criteria  we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets 
accordingly  these transactions receive off balance sheet accounting treatment 
in certain consolidation loan securitization structures  we hold rights that can affect the remarketing of the bonds  such that these trusts did not qualify as qspes and as a result are required to be accounted for on balance sheet as variable interest entities vies 
these securitization structures were developed to broaden and diversify the investor base for consolidation loan securitizations by allowing us to issue bonds with shorter expected maturities and with non amortizing  fixed rate and foreign currency denominated tranches 
as of december   we had billion of securitized student loans in on balance sheet securitization trusts 
these securitizations are included as financings in the table below 
we recognize a gain on sales related to securitizations that qualify as off balance sheet transactions 
the gain is calculated as the difference between the allocated cost basis of the assets sold and the relative fair value of the assets received 
the carrying value of the student loan portfolio being securitized includes the applicable accrued interest  unamortized student loan premiums or discounts  loan loss reserves and borrower benefits reserves 
the fair value of the residual interest is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions discussed in more detail below 
the ongoing earnings from our off balance sheet securitizations are recognized in servicing and securitization revenue 
the following table summarizes our securitization activity for the years ended december   and those securitizations listed as sales are off balance sheet transactions and those listed as financings remain on balance sheet

the company may purchase loans out of this trust at its discretion and as a result  the trust does not qualify as a qspe and is accounted for on balance sheet as a vie 
in certain consolidation loan securitization structures  the company holds certain rights that can affect the remarketing of certain bonds  such that these securitizations did not qualify as qspes 
accordingly  they are accounted for on balance sheet as vies 
the increase in the gain as a percentage of the amount securitized for the private education loan securitizations versus the prior year s transactions is primarily due to the higher earnings spreads on the loans securitized in  improved funding spreads  and a decrease in the cpr assumption used in the calculation of the gains on sale 
the percent average gain on the private education loan securitizations basically reflects the average interest spread of percent earned over an average life of years less life of trust loan losses discounted at percent 
the decrease in the gain as a percentage of the amount securitized for the consolidation loan securitizations versus the transactions is primarily due to significantly less embedded floor income due to interest rates increasing and fewer higher rate loans being securitized 
in we had record levels of securitization transactions due to funding new student loans acquired through the acquisitions of southwest and slfa and to the refinancing of gse debt in connection with the wind down 
in  as expected  there was a decline in our securitization activity to a level that correlates with the volume of student loan purchases 
liquidity risk and funding long term with the dissolution of the gse  our long term funding  credit spread and liquidity exposure to the corporate and asset backed capital markets has increased significantly 
a major disruption in the fixed income capital markets that limits our ability to raise funds or significantly increases the cost of those funds could have a material impact on our ability to acquire student loans  or on our results of operations 
going forward  securitizations will continue to be the primary source of long term financing and liquidity 
our securitizations are structured such that we are not obligated to provide any material level of financial  credit or liquidity support to any of the trusts  thus limiting our exposure to the recovery of the retained interest asset on the balance sheet for off balance sheet securitizations to the loss of the earnings spread for loans securitized on balance sheet 
while all of our retained interests are subject to some prepayment risk  retained interests from our ffelp stafford securitizations have significant prepayment risk primarily arising from borrowers opting to consolidate their stafford plus loans 
when consolidation activity is higher than projected  the increase in prepayment could materially impair the value of our retained interest 
however  this negative effect on our retained interest is somewhat offset by the loans that consolidate back on our balance sheet  which we view as trading one interest bearing asset for another  whereas loans that consolidate with third parties represent a complete economic loss to the company 
we discuss our short term liquidity risk  including a table of our sources of liquidity at the beginning of this liquidity and capital resources section 
retained interest in securitized receivables the following table summarizes the fair value of our retained interests along with the underlying student loans that relate to those securitizations that were treated as sales 
as of december  as of december  retained interest fair value underlying securitized loan balance retained interest fair value underlying securitized loan balance ffelp stafford plus loans consolidation loans private education loans total includes million and million related to the fair value of the embedded floor income as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease in the fair value of the embedded floor income is primarily due to rising interest rates during the period 
unrealized gains pre tax included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the retained interests totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
changes in accounting estimates affecting the residual interest in securitized loans the company updated certain assumptions during that it uses in the valuation of the residual interest 
the following are the significant assumption changes that were made as of december  as of december  ffelp stafford plus loan cpr thereafter thereafter ffelp expected credit losses as a of securitized loan balance outstanding the ffelp stafford plus loan cpr assumption was increased to account for the continued high levels of consolidation loan activity over the last several years 
due to reintroduction of a one percent risk sharing loss assumption related to the reauthorization of the hea see note  allowance for student loan losses for further discussion 
servicing and securitization revenue servicing and securitization revenue  the ongoing revenue from securitized loan pools accounted for off balance sheet as qspes  includes the interest earned on the residual interest and the revenue we receive for servicing the loans in the securitization trusts 
interest income recognized on the residual interest is based on our anticipated yield determined by estimating future cash flows each quarter 
the following table summarizes the components of servicing and securitization revenue for the years ended december   and years ended december  servicing revenue securitization revenue  before embedded floor income and impairment servicing and securitization revenue  before embedded floor income and impairment embedded floor income less floor income previously recognized in gain calculation net embedded floor income servicing and securitization revenue  before impairment retained interest impairment total servicing and securitization revenue average off balance sheet student loans average balance of retained interest servicing and securitization revenue as a percentage of the average balance of off balance sheet student loans annualized servicing and securitization revenue is primarily driven by the average balance of off balance sheet student loans and the amount of and the difference in the timing of embedded floor income recognition on off balance sheet student loans 
servicing and securitization revenue can also be negatively impacted by impairments of the value of our retained interest  caused primarily by the effect of higher than expected consolidation loan activity on ffelp stafford plus student loan securitizations and the effect of market interest rates on the embedded floor income included in the retained interest 
when loans in a securitization trust consolidate  they are a prepayment to the trust resulting in a shorter average life 
we use a cpr assumption to estimate the effect of trust prepayments from loan consolidation and other factors on the life of the trust 
when consolidation activity is higher than forecasted  the residual interest asset can be impaired and the yield used to recognize subsequent income from the trust is negatively impacted 
the majority of the consolidations bring the loans back on balance sheet so for those loans we retain the value of the asset on balance sheet versus in the trust 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded impairments to the retained interests of million  million and million  respectively 
the impairment charge in was primarily caused by the effect of record levels of consolidation activity as well as the increase of expected future cpr assumptions used to value the residual interest 
this surge in consolidation loan activity was due to ffelp stafford borrowers locking in lower interest rates by consolidating their loans prior to the july interest rate reset for ffelp stafford loans 
the level and timing of consolidation loan activity is highly volatile  and in response we continue to revise our estimates of the effects of consolidation loan activity on our retained interests and it may result in additional impairment recorded in future periods if consolidation loan activity remains higher than projected 
our ffelp retained interests were also impaired by million to account for the effect of the one percent risk sharing loss applied to student loans receiving the ep designation 
the increase in risk sharing was included in legislation reauthorizing the higher education act see other related events and information reauthorization 
see lending business segment allowance for ffelp student loans for further discussion regarding the change in the risk sharing exposure 
the impairment charge for is primarily the result of a ffelp stafford loans consolidating at levels faster than projected resulting in million of impairment and b rising interest rates during the second quarter which decreased the value of the floor income component of our retained interest resulting in million of impairment 
impairment for was primarily due to ffelp stafford loans prepaying faster than projected 
these impairment charges are recorded as a loss and are included as a reduction to securitization revenue 
we receive annual servicing fees of basis points  basis points and basis points of the outstanding securitized loan balance related to our ffelp stafford plus  consolidation loan and private education loan securitizations  respectively 
contractual cash obligations the following table provides a summary of our obligations associated with long term notes and equity forward contracts at december  for further discussion of these obligations  see note  long term debt  note  derivative financial instruments  and note  stockholders equity  to the consolidated financial statements

long term beneficial interests of billion of notes issued by consolidated variable interest entities in conjunction with our on balance sheet securitization transactions and included in long term notes in the consolidated balance sheet 
our obligation to repurchase shares under equity forward contracts is calculated using the average purchase prices for outstanding contracts in the year the contracts expire 
at or prior to the maturity date of the agreements  we can purchase shares at the contracted amount plus or minus an early break fee  or we can settle the contract on a net basis with either cash or shares 
if our stock price declines to certain levels  the third parties with whom we entered into the contracts can liquidate their positions prior to the maturity date 
off balance sheet lending arrangements the following table summarizes the commitments associated with student loan purchases and contractual amounts related to off balance sheet lending related financial instruments and guarantees at december  year or less to years to years over years total student loan purchases  lines of credit includes amounts committed at specified dates under forward contracts to purchase student loans and anticipated future requirements to acquire student loans from lending partners discussed below estimated based on future volumes at contractually committed rates 
these commitments are not accounted for as derivatives under sfas no 
as they do not meet the definition of a derivative due to the lack of a fixed and determinable purchase amount 
expiration of commitments and guarantees reflect the earlier of call date or maturity date as of december  we have issued lending related financial instruments including lines of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers 
the contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the maximum possible credit risk should the counterparty draw down the commitment and the counterparty subsequently fails to perform according to the terms of our contract 
the remaining total contractual amount available to be borrowed under these commitments is billion 
we do not believe that these instruments are representative of our actual future credit exposure or funding requirements 
to the extent that the lines of credit are drawn upon  the balance outstanding is collateralized by student loans 
at december   draws on lines of credit were approximately million  which amount is reflected in other loans in the consolidated balance sheet

risks overview managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company 
our most prominent risk exposures are operational  market and interest rate  political and regulatory  liquidity  credit  and consolidation loan refinancing risk 
we discuss these and other risks in the risk factors section item a of this document 
the discussion that follows enhances that disclosure by discussing the risk management strategies employed by the company to mitigate these risks 
operational risk operational risk can result from regulatory compliance errors  servicing errors see further discussion below  technology failures  breaches of the internal control system  and the risk of fraud or unauthorized transactions by employees or persons outside the company 
this risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards and contractual commitments  adverse business decisions or their implementation  and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity 
the federal guarantee on our student loans and our designation as an exceptional performer by ed is conditioned on compliance with origination and servicing standards set by ed and guarantor agencies 
a mitigating factor is our ability to cure servicing deficiencies and historically our losses have been small 
should we experience a high rate of servicing deficiencies  the cost of remedial servicing or the eventual losses on the student loans that are not cured could be material 
our servicing and operating processes are highly dependent on our information system infrastructure  and we face the risk of business disruption should there be extended failures of our information systems  any number of which could have a material impact on our business 
to mitigate these risks we have a number of back up and recovery plans in the event of systems failures  which are tested regularly and monitored constantly 
we manage operational risk through our risk management and internal control processes  which involve each business line including independent cost centers  such as servicing  as well as executive management 
the business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying  controlling  and monitoring operational risk  and each business line manager maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution  proper system operations  safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft  and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data 
we have centralized certain staff functions such as accounting  human resources and legal to further strengthen our operational controls 
while we believe that we have designed effective methods to minimize operational risks  our operations remain vulnerable to natural disasters  human error  technology and communication system breakdowns and fraud 
market and interest rate risk market and interest rate risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices  interest rates  and or foreign currency exchange rates of our financial instruments 
our primary market risk is from changes in interest rates and interest spreads 
we have an active interest rate risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates and maintain consistent earning spreads in all interest rate environments 
we use derivative instruments extensively to hedge our interest rate exposure  but there still is a risk that we are not hedging all potential interest rate exposures or that the hedges do not perform as designed 
we measure interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk 
many assumptions are utilized by management to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income  the more significant of which are related to student loan volumes and pricing  the timing of cash flows from our student loan portfolio  particularly the impact of floor income and the rate of student loan consolidations  basis risk  credit spreads and the maturity of our debt and derivatives 
see also interest rate risk management 
even though we believe our derivatives are economic hedges  changes in interest rates can cause volatility in our earnings for the market value of our derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
under sfas no 
 these changes in derivative market values are recorded through earnings with no consideration for the corresponding change in the fair value of the hedged item 
as a result  our earnings are highly susceptible to changes in interest rates caused by these one sided marks to market 
changes in interest rates can also have a material effect on the amount of floor income earned in our student loan portfolio and the valuation of our retained interest asset 
our earnings can also be materially affected by changes in our estimate of the rate at which loans may prepay in our portfolios as measured by the cpr 
the value of the retained interests on ffelp stafford securitizations is particularly affected by the level of consolidation loan activity 
we face a number of other challenges and risks that can materially affect our future results such as changes in applicable laws and regulations  which may change the volume  average term  effective yields and refinancing options of student loans under the ffelp or provide advantages to competing ffelp and non ffelp loan providers  demand and competition for education financing  financing preferences of students and their families  borrower default rates on private education loans  continued access to the capital markets for funding at favorable spreads particularly for our non federally insured private education loan portfolio  and our operating execution and efficiencies  including errors  omissions  and effectiveness of internal control 
our foreign currency exchange rate exposure is the result of foreign denominated liabilities issued by the company 
cross currency interest rate swaps are used to lock in the exchange rate for the term of the liability 
we are also subject to market risk relative to our equity forward contracts that allow us to repurchase our common stock in the future from a third party at the market price at the time of entering the contract 
should the market value of our stock fall below certain predetermined levels  the counterparty to the contract has a right to terminate the contract and settle all or a portion at the original contract price 
we are required to mark our equity forwards to market  so decreases in our stock price could result in material losses 
political regulatory risk because we operate in a federally sponsored loan program  we are subject to political and regulatory risk 
as part of the hea  the student loan program is periodically amended and must be reauthorized every six years 
past changes included reduced loan yields paid to lenders in and  increased fees paid by lenders in  decreased level of the government guaranty in and reduced fees to guarantors and collectors  among others 
on february   the reauthorization legislation was signed into law 
there are a number of changes that could have a material impact on the company 
for a detailed discussion on the reauthorization legislation and its impact on the company see other related events and information reauthorization 
the secretary of education oversees and implements the hea and periodically issues regulations and interpretations that may impact our business 
liquidity risk see also liquidity and capital resources securitization activities liquidity risk and funding long term credit risk we bear the full risk of borrower and closed school losses experienced in our private education loan portfolio 
these loans are underwritten and priced according to risk  generally determined by a commercially available consumer credit scoring system  fico tm 
because of the nature of our lending  after an initial decrease  borrower fico scores will generally improve over time 
additionally  for borrowers who do not meet our lending requirements or who desire more favorable terms  we require credit worthy co borrowers 
our higher education private education loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy  except in certain limited circumstances 
we have defined underwriting and collection policies  and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all private education loans 
potential credit losses are considered in our risk based pricing model 
the performance of the private education loan portfolio may be affected by the economy  and a prolonged economic downturn may have an adverse effect on its credit performance 
management believes that it has provided sufficient allowances to cover the losses that may be experienced in both the federally guaranteed and private education loan portfolios over the next two years depending on the portfolio 
in addition  when a school closes  losses may be incurred for student borrowers who have not completed their education and in certain states are not required to repay their student loans 
we have provided for these potential losses in our allowance for loan losses 
there is  however  no guarantee that such allowances are sufficient enough to account for actual losses 
see lending business segment private education loans activity in the allowance for private education loan losses 
we have credit risk exposure to the various counterparties with whom we have entered into derivative contracts 
we review the credit standing of these companies 
our credit policies place limits on the amount of exposure we may take with any one party and in most cases  require collateral to secure the position 
the credit risk associated with derivatives is measured based on the replacement cost should the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to the company fail to perform under the terms of the contract 
we also have credit risk with two commercial airlines related to our portfolio of leveraged leases 
see lending business segment other income  net 
consolidation loan refinancing risk the consolidation of our loan portfolio can have detrimental effects 
first  we may lose student loans in our portfolio that are consolidated with other lenders 
in  we experienced a net decrease of million of student loans from consolidation loan activity as more of our ffelp student loans were consolidated with other lenders than were consolidated by us 
this was primarily caused by the run off of consolidation loans through the reconsolidation through the direct lending program  as discussed in lending segment consolidation loan activity 
absent reconsolidation  we would have had a net increase in student loans from consolidation for the second year in a row 
second  consolidation loans have lower net yields than the ffelp stafford loans they replace 
this is somewhat offset by the longer average lives of consolidation loans 
third  we must maintain sufficient  short term liquidity to enable us to cost effectively refinance previously securitized ffelp loans as they are consolidated back on to our balance sheet

interest rate risk management asset and liability funding gap the tables below present our assets and liabilities funding arranged by underlying indices as of december  in the following gaap presentation  the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective sfas no 
hedges those derivatives which are reflected in net interest margin  as opposed to in the derivative market value adjustment 
the difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index 
this represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk  which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude 
management analyzes interest rate risk on a managed basis  which consists of both on balance sheet and off balance sheet assets and liabilities and includes all derivatives that are economically hedging our debt whether they qualify as effective hedges under sfas no

accordingly  we are also presenting the asset and liability funding gap on a managed basis in the table that follows the gaap presentation

includes receivables payables  other assets including retained interest  other liabilities and stockholders equity excluding series b preferred stock 
the funding gaps in the above table are primarily interest rate mismatches in short term indices between our assets and liabilities 
we address this issue primarily through the use of basis swaps that primarily convert quarterly month libor to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices 
these basis swaps do not qualify as effective hedges under sfas no 
and as a result the effect on the funding index is not included in our interest margin and is therefore excluded from the gaap presentation

to the extent possible  we generally fund our assets with debt in combination with derivatives that has the same underlying index index type and index reset frequency 
when it is more economical  we also fund our assets with debt that has a different index and or reset frequency than the asset  but only in instances where we believe there is a high degree of correlation between the interest rate movement of the two indices 
for example  we use daily reset month libor to fund a large portion of our daily reset month commercial paper indexed assets 
in addition  we use quarterly reset month libor to fund a portion of our quarterly reset prime rate indexed private education loans 
we also use our monthly non discreet reset funding asset backed commercial paper program and auction rate securities to fund various asset types 
in using different index types and different index reset frequencies to fund our assets  we are exposed to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk  which is the risk that the different indices that may reset at different frequencies will not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude 
we believe that this risk is low as all of these indices are short term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time 
we use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives 
when compared with the gaap presentation  the managed basis presentation includes all of our off balance sheet assets and funding  and also includes basis swaps that primarily convert quarterly month libor to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices 
interest rate gap analysis in the table below  the company s variable rate assets and liabilities are categorized by reset date of the underlying index 
fixed rate assets and liabilities are categorized based on their maturity dates 
an interest rate gap is the difference between volumes of assets and volumes of liabilities maturing or repricing during specific future time intervals 
the following gap analysis reflects rate sensitive positions at december  and is not necessarily reflective of positions that existed throughout the period

long term debt issuances likely to be called by us or putable by the investor have been categorized according to their call or put dates rather than their maturity dates 
in recent years the shift in the composition of our ffelp student loan portfolio from stafford loans to consolidation loans has lengthened the managed weighted average life of the student loan portfolio from years at december   to years at december  common stock the following table summarizes our common share repurchases  issuances and equity forward activity for the years ended december  and years ended december  shares in millions common shares repurchased open market equity forwards benefit plans total shares repurchased average purchase price per share common shares issued equity forward contracts outstanding at beginning of period new contracts exercises outstanding at end of period authority remaining at end of period to repurchase or enter into equity forwards includes shares withheld from stock option exercises and vesting of performance stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations and shares tendered by employees to satisfy option exercise costs 
the average purchase price per share for and is calculated based on the average strike price of all equity forward contracts including those that were net settled in the cashless transactions discussed above 
the average cash purchase price per share for and is and  respectively  when a zero cash cost is reflected for those shares acquired in the cashless transactions 
during december  september and november  we amended substantially all of our outstanding equity forward purchase contracts 
the strike prices on these contracts were adjusted to the then current market share prices of the common stock and the total number of shares under contract was reduced from million  million and million shares to million  million and million shares  respectively 
as a result of these amendments  we received a total of million and million shares that settled in and  respectively  free and clear in cashless transactions 
this reduction of shares covered by the equity forward contracts is shown on a net basis in the exercises row of the table above 
as of december   the expiration dates and range of and average purchase prices for outstanding equity forward contracts were as follows year of maturity contracts in millions of shares outstanding contracts range of purchase prices average purchase price the closing price of the company s common stock on december  was in december  the company retired million shares of common stock held in treasury at an average price of per share 
this retirement decreased the balance in treasury stock by billion  with corresponding decreases of million in common stock and billion in retained earnings 
other related events and information reauthorization on february   the president signed the higher education reconciliation act of reauthorization legislation 
the reauthorization legislation was included as title viii of the deficit reduction act of s 
 an omnibus budget bill that cut nearly billion in spending over five years  with billion coming from federal student loan programs 
the vast majority of the savings are generated by requiring lenders to rebate floor income under the new loans issued after april  the major new student loan provisions include the following  with effective dates generally july  unless otherwise indicated lenders rebate floor income on new loans after april  borrower origination fees are gradually reduced to zero in ffelp by  and to one percent in direct loan program by collection of one percent ffelp guaranty fee is mandated for all guarantors  including those with voluntary flexible agreements  but can be paid on behalf of the borrower by lenders or guarantors 
lender reinsurance is reduced to percent with exceptional performer designation for claims filed after july   and percent without designation on loans disbursed after july  super step and in school consolidation loopholes will be closed as of july  recycling of percent loans is prohibited for loan holders with more than million in percent loans  as of date of enactment  and other percent reforms enacted in are made permanent 
the limitation on sap for plus loans made after january  is repealed 
loan limits are increased as of july  a moratorium on new schools as lender is created after april   and additional requirements are created for schools continuing to participate in this program 
graduate students become eligible to take out plus loans 
compensation for guarantor collections via loan consolidation is reduced from a maximum of percent to percent  along with a cap on the proportion of collection via consolidations 
requirements for collections via loan rehabilitations are made somewhat easier 
new grant programs are available for pell eligible students 
the reauthorization legislation does not change the interest rates on stafford loans which  under legislation enacted in  are scheduled to become fixed percent for all loans disbursed after july  under the previous legislation  the plus rate was scheduled to become fixed at percent after july  the reauthorization legislation raises this rate to percent for ffelp plus loans 
due to a drafting error in the bill  the plus rate for the fdlp was not changed and remains at percent in the statute 
committee staff have acknowledged this error and we expect it to be corrected prior to the july st effective date 
the rates for consolidation loans are unchanged by the reauthorization legislation  the formula remains the weighted average of the rates on the underling loans  rounded up to the nearest eighth 
the reauthorization legislation does not end the single holder rule affecting loan consolidations  although congress may do so in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity analysis the effect of short term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position has been limited through our interest rate risk management 
the following tables summarize the effect on earnings for the years ended december  and and the effect on fair values at december  and  based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points and basis points while funding spreads remain constant 
year ended december  year ended december  interest rates interest rates change from increase of basis points change from increase of basis points change from increase of basis points change from increase of basis points dollars in millions  except per share amounts effect on earnings increase decrease in pre tax net income before unrealized gains losses on derivative and hedging activities unrealized gains losses on derivative and hedging activities increase in net income before taxes increase in diluted earnings per share at december  interest rates change from increase of basis points change from increase of basis points dollars in millions fair value effect on fair values assets total ffelp student loans private education loans other earning assets other assets total assets liabilities interest bearing liabilities other liabilities total liabilities at december  interest rates change from increase of basis points change from increase of basis points dollars in millions fair value effect on fair values assets total ffelp student loans private education loans other earning assets other assets total assets liabilities interest bearing liabilities other liabilities total liabilities a primary objective in our funding is to minimize our sensitivity to changing interest rates by generally funding our floating rate student loan portfolio with floating rate debt 
however  as discussed under lending business segment summary of our managed student loan portfolio floor income  in the current low interest rate environment  we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding if the student loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating 
during the year ended december  and  certain ffelp student loans were earning floor income and we locked in a portion of that floor income through the use of futures and floor income contracts 
the result of these hedging transactions was to convert a portion of the fixed rate nature of student loans to variable rate  and to fix the relative spread between the student loan asset rate and the variable rate liability 
in the above table under the scenario where interest rates increase and basis points  the increase in pre tax net income before the unrealized derivative market value adjustment for and is primarily due to the impact of i our off balance sheet hedged consolidation loan securitizations and the related embedded floor income recognized as part of the gain on sale  which results in no change in the embedded floor income as a result of the increase in rates but does result in a decrease in payments on the written floor contracts  offset by ii our unhedged on balance sheet loans earning in a fixed rate mode as discussed above 
due to the continued increase in interest rates during  the above factors had less impact on pre tax net income for the year ended december  the change in pre tax net income before the unrealized derivative market value adjustment under a basis point increase in rates is not proportional to the change under the scenario where interest rates increase basis points because of the additional spread earned on loans hedged with futures and swaps mentioned above and the greater proportion of loans earning at a floating rate under a basis point increase in rates 
in addition to interest rate risk addressed in the preceding tables  the company is also exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and the equity price of its own stock 
foreign currency exchange risk is the result of foreign denominated debt issued by the company 
the company s policy is to use cross currency interest rate swaps to swap all foreign denominated debt payments fixed and floating to us dollar libor using a fixed exchange rate 
in the tables above  there would be an immaterial impact on earnings if exchange rates were to decrease or increase  due to the terms of the hedging instrument and hedged items matching 
the balance sheet interest bearing liabilities would be affected by a change in exchange rates  however  the change would be materially offset by the cross currency interest rate swaps in other assets or other liabilities 
equity price risk of the company s own stock is due to equity forward contracts used in the company s share repurchase program 
a hypothetical decrease in the company s stock price per share of and would decrease unrealized gains losses on derivative and hedging activities by million and million  respectively 
in addition to the net income impact  other assets would decrease by the aforementioned amounts 
stock price decreases can also result in the counterparty exercising its right to demand early settlement on a portion of or the total contract depending on trigger prices set in each contract 
with the and decrease in unit stock price above  none of these triggers would be met and no counterparty would have the right to early settlement
